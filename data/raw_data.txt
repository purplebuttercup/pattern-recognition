time of promise and progress for lawter we have sharpened our focus to capitalize on our core values competencies and relationships we are beginning to realize the benefits of an million investment in a new global manufacturing platform we have the flexibility of a strong balance sheet to pursue the opportunities of a consolidating global market and we are proving lawter chemistry can compete successfully in major new markets that hold promise as avenues of profitable growth after a year of management transition and hard decisions including closing four plants forming a new paints and coatings division and selling our thermographic equipment business we are confident that lawter is well positioned for improved financial performance and accelerated growth in and beyond results reflected the momentum that is beginning to build sales of million were down percent due to softness in major markets brought on by record high paper prices at the end of strengthening of the u s dollar versus major trading currencies and by our conscious decision not to accept lower margin volumes in europe in order to strengthen operating profit margins still excluding the effects of a one time charge on results net earnings grew by percent to million or cents per share in reflecting improved margins from our plant modernization program on a comparative quarterly basis results were up each of the last three quarters of over the trends are in the right direction sadly our founder chairman and friend daniel j terra passed away on june apart from his many civic and cultural contributions daniel terra s legacy was to leave lawter shareholders with one of the world s finest specialty polymers companies the company he created is successful because we are highly focused we have unequaled research and manufacturing assets and we can deliver custom solutions globally we know our business we know our customers needs and we deliver the core ink market we serve is growing at a rate slightly greater than inflation however we see opportunities for lawter to grow more profitably and at a faster rate than our markets and our industry by aggressively harnessing our strengths to meet changing market and customer needs both within and outside our core market our goal is to achieve double digit sales and earnings growth we intend to closely manage costs so that overhead grows more slowly than revenue while earnings grow at a faster rate than sales we will follow four basic strategies to achieve these goals strengthen our position in our core ink business by developing new products and services to more fully address the market s needs and grow total market share after years there remain important areas in the graphic arts industry such as publication gravure where lawter has room to grow its products and penetration as you will read we are responding with novel solutions to the opportunities being created by global consolidation of the ink and printing industries and to changing technologies within the printing industry we also have sizable opportunities internationally particularly in the asia pacific region where lawter has had a small but growing presence one fourth of the world s inks are produced in this region with about half of that in japan in our r d team in tianjin china focused closely on the special needs of this market and developed our first resins based on the resin modifying phenols preferred by japanese ink manufacturers to begin expanding our presence in that market closer to home we continue to develop new ink vehicles and varnishes that offer superior performance at lower cost for today s high speed offset presses this high speed press technology is leading the printing industry s growth by increasing its share of the market for high volume quality printing these then are examples of the opportunities in our core market global opportunities we are well positioned to capture develop market opportunities outside our core ink business but within our core competencies to expand our sales base and achieve greater operating leverage lawter s core expertise is in understanding the chemistry and physics of formulating and applying coatings to a variety of surfaces whose properties we also understand to achieve desired performance results our products help make it possible to print color newspaper photos that do not smudge coatings on metal beverage cans that will not scratch and printing on plastic food wrappings that will not crack in the cold in we created a new division to begin transferring this expertise to the billion global paints and coatings industry nearly percent of the materials in paints and coatings are resins and environmental requirements are forcing producers to reformulate their products with new resin mixes we intend to identify needs created in this process and use our advanced r d and manufacturing to produce niche solutions one of our first is reactol a resin that makes paint more resistant to corrosion chipping and flaking characteristics that previously had to be compromised to achieve required environmental results cytec industries one of the world s leading producers of the amino resins widely used as a base for paints and powders last year began offering a blend using reactol polyol to produce coatings that are harder and more flexible than competitive products we also are working on products that will make it possible to apply house paint with less preparation as well as other paints and coatings applications improve operating efficiency and extend our position as the industry s productivity leader by completing the restructuring of our capital asset base historically we have established manufacturing facilities close to customers to improve delivery and customization capabilities but the demands of today s high volume high quality production require a new strategy so since we have undertaken the most complete modernization of production and r d facilities in the history of the company with the opening of our second major new plant in kallo belgium last fall we now have on two continents the most modern polymer plants in our industry we also have a modern facility in tianjin china to service the asia pacific market as well as major plants in waterford ireland and moundville alabama and smaller facilities strategically located around the world these new and expanded capabilities have enabled us to close older less efficient manufacturing operations in the united states and europe they also will help us develop creative new products that provide improved performance over what is available in the market today and enable us to produce them with much greater efficiency our new manufacturing platform is enabling us to develop new closer relationships with customers which we believe will add to our business volume and increase both top and bottom line growth that is because with these plants there are unique ways to handle goods and work individually with customers to create win win opportunities for both lawter and our customers we intend to aggressively pursue these strategic opportunities make selective acquisitions to strengthen our worldwide business position and product offerings our growth objectives cannot be realized through internally generated activities alone we will acquire companies within our core business or closely aligned with our core business technologies either to add to our sales mix and expand our service offerings or to establish a more competitive presence in new markets and segments of the markets we choose to serve for example during we acquired hercules inc s lithographic resins business and wolstenholme rink plc s resins and varnish business to strengthen our position in these markets and to take advantage of the capabilities and efficiencies of our new manufacturing base these are some of the reasons we are enthusiastic about the future this management team deeply appreciates what is special about lawter and the legacy granted by daniel terra we are keenly aware of the values competencies and relationships responsible for our success we have developed sound strategies for taking lawter forward on these strengths we remain totally committed to creating shareholder value and as with daniel terra we respect the fact that our performance depends on the contributions of men and women in countries who make up the lawter team their efforts every day make it possible for us to submit this report with pride in our accomplishments and confidence in our future opportunity consolidation over the past decade the world ink and printing industries have consolidated leaving fewer more dominant market participants these industry giants buy in larger volumes often operate globally and increasingly are choosing to rely on fewer bigger suppliers able to meet their exacting quality standards demanding just in time delivery schedules and worldwide operating requirements among the specialty polymers companies focused on the printing ink market lawter is one of the few that can meet these specifications on every count our intent is to get closer to these global market leaders by adding value in new ways with new products services and relationships that take advantage of our broad product line industry leading research financial flexibility and flexible world class manufacturing we alone are positioned to provide global sourcing contracts and global sales service research and manufacturing for nearly all the specialty ink making polymers these market leaders require whenever and wherever they require them at the same time lawter remains fully committed to serving the entire spectrum of our printing ink customers we recently established account groups to service every customer with a dedicated team including sales r d manufacturing and quality assurance so we will better understand the unique requirements of each customer at every level and have the focused resources necessary to ensure they receive superior quality and service opportunity changing needs growth in the billion worldwide ink industry is being driven by such factors as growing literacy rising consumerism in emerging markets and the expansion of catalog shopping within developed nations as the world s leading specialty polymers company focused primarily on this market lawter is well positioned to grow with these trends but the needs of ink manufacturers and their customers also are being defined at a more fundamental level by such technical issues as faster press speeds wider presses recycled papers environmental concerns and new distributed print models that make it necesary to produce consistent precision quality for documents produced at multiple sites lawter s ability to respond to the accelerating pace of such changes in the printing inks and graphic arts industries more rapidly and more effectively than our competitors represents our second major opportunity to outgrow our markets at lawter we have been the industry s leading innovator for generations in the s we were the first to figure out how to successfully apply heatset varnishes making possible a whole new generation of colorful glossy magazines more recently we have developed a new class of high molecular weight resins to stand up to the physical stresses of presses that run at speeds of up to feet per minute nearly double the rate of the fastest presses a decade ago our new ultra rez and webvar products are dramatically less costly yet offer significantly improved print quality our innovations have helped to make lithography more cost competitive we have more than products in our line with about active at any time yet these numbers belie the magnitude of our ability to create and customize solutions orders for nearly all lawter products can be customized to alter viscosity solubility and other characteristics to meet the precise operating requirements and performance expectations of a particular customer in a particular plant for a particular job opportunity world class advantages a strong flexible balance sheet experienced capable people the intellectual capital of a company with years experience in one focused business a reputation for quality and service and global relationships to match these are some of lawter s competitive advantages now add to them world class research and manufacturing half a million square feet brought on line over the past four years and you have the necessary elements for the next major profitable growth period for lawter with our modern laboratories and new proprietary manufacturing processes we are increasing yields reducing costs improving quality even making new products and customer relationships possible the start up of our square foot kallo belgium plant in the third quarter of completed the lion s share of an million capital investment program designed to give lawter leading edge manufacturing technologies for the st century the results since the opening of kallo s sister plant in pleasant prairie wisconsin and a smaller facility in tianjin china demonstrate the value of the company s largest capital program ever manufacturing in these hub plants is highly automated with computer based controls designed to monitor and record all production systems and provide real time data collection as a result we have dramatically improved production cycle times for our printing ink vehicle alkyd and hard resin production lines operating efficiencies quality and product standardization have improved accordingly for example in the past two or three smaller kettles had to be combined to fill a road tanker our new facility is able to fill a tanker with a single kettle in addition new pressurized high temperature processing technologies allow ink vehicles to be manufactured in one continuous process more importantly perhaps the same technologies have made it possible for lawter to produce new types of resins and ink vehicles with improved print properties at lower cost this new technology along with the hercules acquisition late last year now offers lawter an opportunity to look into the publication gravure market this is a large segment of the printing industry which lawter has not been part of in the united states return to top of page about

during the first quarter of unit volume increased by percent growth was especially strong in the acrylic businesses polymers and resins monomers plastics additives and atohaas americas which reported a collective percent increase in volume over the same period in i can say with assurance that rohm and haas is back on its historic growth track of about percent per year the highest internal growth rate in the s p chemical index net earnings were up percent earnings per common share were up percent excellent internal cost control and the share buyback program enabled rohm and haas to overcome the effects of negative currency swings in europe and japan and a less favorable product mix i was extremely disappointed about the ravaging of our stock price in march the observation on march th that currency swings might cause first quarter earnings to fall below the consensus first call estimate of cost shareholders billion in market value over the next two days and although the stock price has recovered somewhat since that time it is my duty to do everything i can to see that the rohm and haas stock price more accurately reflects the true strength of this company as soon as possible shareholders who have been with us over the past year are still considerably ahead from may to may the value of rohm and haas stock increased percent the board of directors elected four new officers

acrylic businesses polymers and resins and plastics additives reporting volume improvements in nearly every geographic region for the second quarter in a row agricultural chemicals formulation chemicals atohaas ion exchange resins and biocides also reported volume increases clearly we have regained momentum and our core acrylic businesses are back on a solid growth track selling administrative and research sar costs remained essentially flat during the quarter we ve said since we would keep below the line costs flat and we ve done it we also intend to hold them steady in obviously we can t keep the lid on sar spending forever but we can keep below the line costs growing at rates lower than inflation and we intend to do so raw material costs were down percent for the quarter compared to year ago levels and down slightly from the second quarter of this year while the raw material cost decline was helpful selling prices also were down percent as a result we ve seen an improvement in our overall selling price raw material cost relationship but we have not yet regained the balance we enjoyed before raw material prices skyrocketed in we completed the repurchase of million shares of our common stock in september we continue to have strong cash flow and our debt to equity ratio was below percent because of our strong cash position the board of directors approved a second buyback program of another million shares in mid october the outlook for the remainder of is positive though the fourth quarter comparison with last year will not be as favorable as it was

per share third quarter nine months percent change percent change net sales net earnings net earnings per common share chairman s letter rohm and haas had a terrific third quarter one that reflects the continuation of trends seen all year unit volume grew a solid percent most of that growth occurred in the more specialty areas of our portfolio in electronic chemicals and the higher end of the polymers and resins business the sales increase was limited to percent for the quarter due to the ongoing impact of weaker foreign currencies the company reported record earnings of million for the quarter thanks to strong ongoing demand an excellent job of controlling internal costs and the increased efficiency of manufacturing operations earnings per common share were up percent looking ahead i expect to see the trends of the first three quarters continue through the end of the year as long as there are no surprises in economic conditions or currency exchange rates during the fourth quarter fred w shaffer vice president and chief financial officer retired at the end of august after years of service fred s legacy can be seen in the strong financial structure that underpins the company s performance in on behalf of the board of directors and the employees of rohm and haas i thank him for his excellent work over the years and wish him and his wife meriel a happy retirement on october th the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million shares of common stock or approximately percent of the million shares outstanding as of september j lawrence wilson chairman november management discussion and analysis third quarter versus third quarter third quarter earnings were million up from last year s earnings of million earnings per common share of rose from per common share in volume increased in the quarter as a result of strong demand in polymers resins and monomers and performance chemicals the latter segment s performance was helped largely by the electronic chemicals businesses despite good volume growth sales of million were just above the prior year period reflecting weaker currencies in japan and in europe and moderately lower selling prices earnings increased as a result of higher volume smooth plant operations earnings from affiliates and lower interest expense in addition to higher earnings the per share increase reflects the impact of the company s common share repurchase program polymers resins and monomers earnings were million down compared with the prior year sales increased as a result of a increase in volume offset by weaker currencies and slightly lower selling prices volume strength was evident in all regions reaching double digits in europe latin america and asia pacific with particularly strong contributions from products for the paper adhesives and coatings markets the decrease in earnings was driven largely by unfavorable currencies performance chemicals recorded earnings of million a increase from last year s earnings on higher volume and higher sales the electronic chemicals business reported strong sales and earnings increases in all regions in which they participate electronic chemicals earnings were also helped by the contribution of rodel inc an affiliate acquired in the second quarter of despite strong volume growth sales and earnings in both ion exchange resins and biocides were essentially flat because of unfavorable currencies and selling prices plastics reported earnings of million up from million reported for the same period in a volume decrease of combined with weaker currencies in europe and lower overall selling prices led to lower sales though the volume decrease had a negative earnings impact roughly break even results in atohaas europe compared to losses in the period allowed plastics to show an earnings improvement agricultural chemicals recorded losses of million compared with earnings of million in the third quarter of sales were lower than which reflected lower volume and the effect of weaker currencies in europe and japan the volume decrease is the net effect of lower sales of dithane in all regions except latin america largely related to weather conditions the earnings decrease is a result of lower volume and unfavorable currency impacts corporate expenses of million in were down million from last year s third quarter due largely to lower interest expense resulting from lower average debt balances during the quarter net sales were million up from the third quarter gross profit margin was down from for the period due to weaker currencies in europe and japan and slightly lower selling prices offset by higher volume affiliate earnings for the quarter were million compared to a loss of million this increase reflects the contribution of rodel inc the rohmax joint venture and improved results in atohaas europe the effective tax rate for the quarter was compared with a year ago this decrease is primarily a result of the effect of affiliate earnings which are recorded on an after tax basis nine months versus nine months earnings for the first nine months were million higher than last year s earnings of million earnings per common share were up from the period sales increased to million unit volume increased sales growth was hindered by weaker currencies the absence of petroleum chemicals sales now part of the rohmax joint venture and slightly lower selling prices earnings for the first nine months were driven by higher volume and earnings from affiliates in addition to higher earnings the per share increase reflects the impact of the company s common share repurchase program polymers resins and monomers earnings of million were up from excluding the effect of the former petroleum chemicals business sales were up on an volume increase all regions reported strong volume growth but the favorable impact on sales was offset in part by weaker currencies and slightly lower selling prices products for the paper adhesives and coatings markets reported particularly strong volume growth versus earnings increases are primarily a result of higher volume performance chemicals reported earnings of million a increase over last year s number sales essentially were unchanged from volume increased the volume increase did not result in sales growth because of weaker currencies in europe and in the asia pacific region the extent of the volume increase was hindered by the discontinuation of the biocides joint venture with dead sea bromine higher volumes in electronic chemicals and in ion exchange resins offset some of this decrease the increased earnings reflect strong results reported by the electronic chemicals businesses including a contribution from the recent investment in rodel inc this offset weaker results for biocides and ion exchange resins plastics recorded earnings of million an increase from million in volume increased while sales essentially were unchanged due to lower selling prices and weaker currencies in europe plastics reported higher earnings due to modest results reported in the atohaas europe business through nine months of versus losses in the same period of agricultural chemicals earnings were million down million from the same period of sales were down due to lower volume and weaker currencies in europe and japan the volume decrease was due

third quarter retroactive tax credit on sales outside of the united states liquidity capital resources and other financial data at the end of the quarter cash and cash equivalents totaled million up

the stockholders of wynn s international inc we are pleased to report that wynn s international inc had another very successful year in in addition to achieving record financial results for the fifth consecutive year we also strengthened the future prospects of wynn s through an acquisition and a disposition our efforts have drawn a very favorable reaction from the investment community the price of a common share at december increased over the share price at the end of which itself was a improvement over the price at the end of our share price performance compared to the general stock market and to our industry peer group has been impressive over the past several years see financial highlights section for a graph showing total return to investors during the fourth quarter of the board of directors authorized a three for two stock split which is the third three for two split in less than four years this split is part of a continuing series of actions by the board to enhance the attractiveness of wynn s common stock to institutional and individual investors in last year s letter we stated our belief that wynn s stock was undervalued in the marketplace despite the substantial appreciation in the price of wynn s common stock in we feel that the stock is still undervalued because of the fundamental strengths of wynn s underlying wynn s success is a continuing devotion to our primary corporate strategy detailed in our annual reports in earlier years we combine the use of technology to develop new and better products with outstanding service to sell those products our dedicated work force is attuned to the needs of our customers but remains focused on being the low cost producer the company s solid foundation provides the basis for our optimistic outlook after a review of the financial results we will describe in more detail our accomplishments and other developments during the past year and discuss our plans for the future financial highlights in may we sold substantially all of the operating assets of wynn s climate systems air conditioning business due to this sale we have recast our financial statements into continuing and discontinued operations the focus of my comments will be on continuing operations which provides better comparability between the current and historical performance of our continuing businesses income from continuing operations in was a gain over s strong performance earnings per share from continuing operations were an increase of compared to in all per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the three for two stock split to stockholders of record in december the earnings growth in our continuing operations was driven by another record year of revenues and profits at our two main business units wynn oil company wynn oil and wynn s precision inc precision we also had a significant increase in interest income net of interest expense in due to the substantial reduction of debt in and the growth of short term investments in net income for the year ended december was an all time record and a increase over s net income included in the net income is the after tax loss realized on the sale of wynn s climate systems operating assets on a per share basis net income in rose to per share a jump over the reported in consolidated revenues from continuing operations in were a increase over revenues of we re pleased to have achieved one of our principal goals which was double digit revenue growth in the continuing rapid growth of the wynn oil product warranty division and the precision composite gasket product line were the major factors behind the increased sales our gross margin in was only slightly below the margin achieved in the small decline in gross margin was due mainly to the change in mix of products sold in compared to the mix change also led to a beneficial decline in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues which fell to in from in the decline in operating expenses reflects the operating leverage of our business units as we were able to increase our revenues without a proportionate increase in costs results in the fourth quarter of were similar to the full year results net sales from continuing operations for the quarter were a increase over the fourth quarter of revenues for the fourth quarter benefited from precision s september acquisition of an automotive plastic sealing business income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of was or per share a increase over the fourth quarter net income for the fourth quarter of including discontinued operations was or per share a increase over the prior year in the fourth quarter of the discontinued air conditioning business recorded a loss of our consolidated financial position strengthened again in due to the earnings and cash flow generated by our operating units and the cash received from the sale of the air conditioning business cash balances at december were which represents an increase of over million during the year end cash balances are net of the approximately million used for the precision acquisition in september we ended again with virtually no interest bearing debt unchanged from the beginning of the year stockholders equity rose to at december return on average equity which has been steadily increasing reached a very impressive in our long standing dividend payment record now covers consecutive quarters at the february board of directors meeting the board declared a quarterly dividend of per share representing a increase over the previous dividend rate and the fourth increase in the dividend rate in the past four years the dividend increases and stock splits since reflect the board of directors belief in the strength of the company and its continued commitment to enhance stockholder value the year in review many of our efforts proved successful in among the most notable was precision s september niche acquisition of an automotive sealing business that manufactures and sells plastic seals to automotive original equipment manufacturers and tier suppliers through this acquisition precision boosted its production capabilities and marketing prowess for these products we expect many positive returns from this acquisition in the years ahead in may we sold the operating assets of our former automotive air conditioning business wynn s climate systems inc this division s spotty results were masking the strengths of the other wynn s operating units the sale enables us to devote more resources to the higher margin businesses of precision and wynn oil which in turn should generate more cash for future growth both internally and through acquisitions we expect to receive approximately million of cash of which we have received million at december from all sources in connection with the wynn s climate systems disposition the wynn oil product warranty division and precision s composite gasket operations were the leaders in internal growth in through innovative product development and marketing these very different businesses produced strong results in and are expected to continue growing in wynn oil continues to generate more

respects from u s gaap the material differences between canadian and u s gaap and their effect on the company s financial statements are summarized below purchase method u s gaap requires the amalgamation of companies to be accounted for under the purchase method if one of the amalgamation companies owns or more of the total outstanding voting common stock of any of the combining enterprises whereas canadain gaap allows the pooling of interests method to be used under the purchase method the market value of the amalgamated company s shares exchanged to acquire the assets is used to determine the value of the assets purchased these assets are then recorded at fair market value offset by an increase to the capital stock of the new company long term investments u s gaap requires long term investments accounted for under the equity method to be recorded at the lower of cost and market canadian gaap does not require a write down to market value unless the impairment to long term investments is considered to be permanent or has persisted for several consecutive years furthermore under u s gaap the gain or loss resulting from shares issued by a subsidiary is treated as additional paid in capital while under canadian gaap the gain or loss is reflected in earnings exploration and development properties u s gaap requires that only expenses that are direct and incremental to a specific project be capitalized under canadian gaap minimum advance royalty payments and costs directly attributable to an exploration or development property can be capitalized whether incremental or not exchange on long term monetary items u s gaap requires unrealized exchange gains or losses on long term monetary items with fixed or ascertainable lives to be included in income as they arise while under canadian gaap such items are deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the related item pooling of interests u s gaap requires that the acquisition of a company by way of an exchange of common shares between companies that were not related within two years before the plan of combination is initiated be treated as a pooling of interests under canadian gaap the purchase method is used if an acquirer can be identified the major difference between the two methods is that the pooling of interests method requires the assets of the combining companies be recorded at book value while the purchase method requires the assets of the acquired company be recorded at the fair market value as of the date of acquisition incorporated joint ventures u s gaap requires investments in incorporated joint ventures to be accounted for under the equity method while under canadian gaap the accounts of incorporated joint ventures are proportionately consolidated

structures from the and levels several good intersections have been encountered which indicate that the mineralized structure around the level in the current mining area extends down to the level and potentially deeper cross cuts and drill stations are being developed in order to continue the drilling of mineralized zones the number two shaft with feet of vertical footage per level provides access

collateralized by the assets of hycroft and a guarantee of the parent company the borrowings under the facility are repayable after two years the facility is renewable for two renewal periods of one year each differences between canadian and united states generally accepted accounting principles the significant differences between generally accepted accounting principles gaap in canada and in the united states are as follows under canadian gaap the amalgamation of granges and hycroft was treated in a manner similar to a pooling of interest under u s gaap the amalgamation does not meet the conditions for pooling of interest accordingly the transaction is treated as a purchase under u s gaap with the excess of proceeds over the net book value of hycroft s net assets allocated to mineral properties under canadian corporate law the company underwent a capital reduction in connection with the amalgamation of granges and hycroft whereby share capital and contributed surplus were reduced to eliminate the consolidated accumulated deficit of granges as of december after giving effect to the estimated costs of the amalgamation under u s corporate law no such transaction is available and accordingly is not allowed under u s gaap under canadian gaap corporate income taxes are accounted for using the deferral method of income tax allocation under u s gaap corporate income taxes are accounted for using the liability method of income tax allocation the company has recorded no tax expense under either canadian or u s gaap due to cumulative net losses incurred by the company additionally any deferred tax assets resulting from cumulative net losses under u s gaap would be offset by a valuation allowance with regard to the purchase of da capo under u s gaap the excess of purchase price over net book value acquired would be tax affected giving rise to a credit to deferred income taxes and a debit to mineral properties this would result in a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance with the resulting credit being allocated against mineral properties in the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of effective for fiscal years beginning after december sfas no requires that long lived assets and associated intangibles be written down to fair value whenever an impairment review indicates that the carrying value cannot be recovered on an undiscounted cash flow basis under u s gaap the carrying value of the hycroft mine including the excess of proceeds over the net book value from a above does not exceed the undiscounted cash flow accordingly the hycroft mine carrying value is being written down to fair value using the discounted cash method following u s gaap in the fasb issued sfas no accounting for stock based compensation effective for fiscal years beginning after december this standard established a fair value method for accounting for stock based compensation plans either through recognition or disclosure management elected the disclosure option under the standard and therefore adoption does not give rise to any u s canadian gaap differences in either the balance sheet or income statement the significant differences in the consolidated statements of earnings and deficit relative to u s gaap were as follows cash flows for the company under canadian gaap are presented in the consolidated statement of changes in cash resources under canadian gaap all financing and investment activities are presented on the face of the statement under u s gaap only cash transactions are presented with non cash transactions disclosed separately the purchase of da capo resources ltd note was a non cash transaction accordingly under u s gaap the non cash portion of the acquisition of and issue of shares for da capo resources ltd would not be included in the statement the gain on the sale of the company s base metal properties was a non cash transaction accordingly under u s gaap the proceeds from the sale of mineral properties and marketable securities and the purchase of investments would both be reduced by the value of the non cash transaction supplemental disclosures of cash flow information page design copyright copy palomar media corporation all rights reserved registered trademarks are used under

information top coke plant turning coal into coke is necessary in making steel because coal does not burn hot enough to melt iron ore coal in its origional state is mostly carbon however there are impurities in coal such as tar ammonia etc these impurities keep coal from burning hot enough to reduce and melt iron ore therefore they must be removed through the coking process oven size feet long to inches wide tapered feet tall of ovens original in operation today charging the coal is dumped into the ovens from a larry car on top of the battery cycle the coal will bake at degrees f for hours quenching the coke is pushed out of the oven and quenched with gal of water gal will be vaporized capacity the ovens will hold tons of coal which will be turned into tons of coke by products the volatile gasses driven off in the process are cooled and refined into tar fertilizer oils etc products made from coal by products include plastics perfume aspirin nylon cosmetics etc top blast furnace the blast furnaces make cast iron from iron ore coke and limestone its functions are both reducing the iron ore or removing the oxygen and melting it into molten cast iron of blast furnaces we have three blast furnaces b f raw materials consumption per furnace iron ore coke tons iron production tons per furnace per day summary air is heated to degrees f and blown into the bottom of the furnace at mph the hot air helps the coke to burn which reduces and melts the iron ore temperatures in the bf reach degrees the iron ore and limestone melt and drips into the trough the limestone makes slag which floats on top of the iron and is later skimmed off the trough is drilled every hours and the iron runs through ditches to the ladles top cupola furnace the plasma cupola makes molten cast iron from scrap steel or a scrap substitute the fuel for this furnace is coke and megawatts of plasma electiricity geneva has one cupola cupola raw materials consumption iron production the cupola produces approximately tons of iron per day summary the furnace is charged with coke and scrap steel or a scrap substutite heated air is boosted in temperature with a plasma torch and blown into the bottom of the cupola the coke is burned creating more heat which melts the iron the iron then exits the furnace and runs through a trough to an iron ladle top q bop of q bop s two vessels capacity the average heat size is tons temperature the steel is approximately degrees when it is tapped alloys alloy additions include carbon aluminum manganese silicon molybdenum titanium chrome nickel etc at geneva we make over kinds of steel cycle the q bop s are run hours a day the cycle takes approximately minutes including charging and tapping environmental info during the process oxygen is used as the fuel to remove carbon from the iron the oxygen turns into carbon monoxide after being quenched and scrubbed to remove the particulate the carbon monoxide is flared at the top of the stack turning it into carbon dioxide the secondary emission control system consists of a baghouse which will filter the particulate from the off gasses when the vessel is not in blow summary the q bop process turns iron into steel cast iron from the blast furnace is approximately percent carbon in the q bop the carbon is taken down to percent carbon one percent carbon is the cut off point between cast iron and steel scrap is charged into the vessel first approx tons two ladles pour tons of hot metal into the vessel with the scrap the vessel is turned into an upright position and oxygen is blown into the bath through tuyeres holes in the bottom of the vessel after approximately minutes in blow the vessel is turned on its side and a sample is taken to verify the chemistry is accurate if the test results are correct the vessel will be turned degrees to pour the steel out through a small tap hole into the steel ladle the ladle is then transported by carrier to the lmf for further chemistry refinement top continuous caster the continuous caster was a major part of our modernization in this process molten steel is turned into a solid slab of steel the caster was built in line with our rolling mill to help reduce the energy cost of re heating steel slab sizes this caster is the worlds widest single and twin caster slab thickness can range from to to date we have only cast thick slabs temperatures liquid steel going into the caster is approximately degrees solid steel coming out of the caster is approximately degrees cast speed the speed of the caster depends on the size of the slab made the average speed is inches per minute cost million summary the steel is brought to the caster from the q bop via rubber tired transporter the steel is taken to the ladle metallurgy furnace lmf where the temperature and chemistry are adjusted the steel is then lifted onto the turret and poured into a tundish from the tundish the steel flows into the mold of the caster at this point the outer edges of the steel begins to solidify after passing through the mold the steel travels through the various segments of the caster all the while being sprayed with a water and air mixture when the steel exits the segments the steel is solid the slab is then cut by an oxygen torch that travels with the steel the average slab size is between to tons top rolling mill geneva s rolling mill is the worlds widest six stand finishing mill the mill was originally built as a four stand plate mill two additional finishing stands were added shortly after usx purchased the plant because of the unique nature of our mill coupled with our modernization we are now able to produce plate products like most steel mills produce coil products for example we now can make steel slabs wide wide slabs heating capacity steel slabs are heated in either the soaking pits or the re heat furnaces in the fall we will start our induction furnace which will take slabs directly out of the caster and bump the temperature up to degrees and send it directly into the rolling mill reversing the finishing end of the rolling mill consists of two reversing roughers one rated at horse power the other rated at h p in combination with the main large reversing mill are hydraulic vertical edgers coilbox the coilbox coils the steel after the reversing process and before the finishing process to keep the steel an even temperature and protect from heat loss the steel is then un coiled and rolled through the finishing stands finishing stands geneva has six finishing stands this is what makes us unique in the steel industry these mills can finish either plate steel or coil products the steel comes into the finishing stands at approximately inch thick and degrees f the finishing stands roll the steel to the customers specifications varying in thickness from thick to cooling beds and down coilers the steel travels through a laminar flow cooling bed to the coilers where the steel is coiled for the final time large coils will weigh over tons top finishing customers use steel for many different applications to accommodate some of those demands we have several finishing facilities that process different kinds of steel coil products some of the steel is sold in a coil these coils are called hot bands coils and strip many of these coils will be processed further by the customer these processes include pickling and oiling cold rolling galvanizing annealing and tin plating cut up line this line handles coiled plate products the steel is allowed to cool and is un rolled side trimmed cut to length and then leveled this line can uncoil steel up to inch thick and feet wide heavy gauge the heavy gauge line processes plate steel from inches to inches thick and inches wide the steel is uncoiled leveled side trimmed and cut to length this line also handles diamond floor plate sheet mill the sheet mill processes strip products into sheet steel this line handles light guage steel between to inches thick and up to inches wide the steel is uncoiled side trimmed leveled and cut to length this line also handles diamond floor plate temper mill tempering steel means to work the steel in a rolling process without reducing the thickness the steel is uncoiled worked through a rolling process the sides are sheared and the steel is coiled pipe mill the pipe mill takes coils and forms them into small diameter pipe products ranging from in diameter to the steel is uncoiled leveled welded to the end of the previous coil side trimmed run through the forming rolls to make it into a pipe and electric resistance welded erw the pipe is then cut to length and tested top shipping most of our products are shipped by rail the union pacific and the southern pacific or denver rio grand s main lines meet on the south side of the plant we also ship by truck tonnage traditionally geneva has produced million tons of finished product with our modernization and increasing yields production is planned to increase to the million ton level products because we have a unique rolling mill we are able to produce either plate or coils on the same mill the product mix varies from year to year depending on the margins of various products the objective for the company is fill the niche in the market for wide heavy gauge plate welcome news releases plant tour environment community sales geneva steel p o box

john s huntington september please email comments to gmaurer dreamscape com chapter chapter the clayville lab chapter the move to new york mills chapter the early days at middle settlement road chapter special metals inc chapter early smc days with allegheny ludlum chapter the decade of the seventies closing thoughts chapter to around the gas turbine engine developed by air commodore whittle in england was brought to the united states and general electric started producing the i engine high temperature alloys at that time were rather limited and hastalloy b and vitallium were probably among the first materials used for turbine buckets utica drop forge and tool corp with a national reputation for its high quality precision hand tools was one of the first companies to forge buckets for the ge engine other forgers included steel improvement and forge co sifco and thompson ramo wooldridge trw dr falih n darmara had joined drop forge as chief metallurgist in after moving east from the copper industry in utah where he had worked since receiving his masters and doctorate degrees at mit and harvard primarily responsible for the metallurgy of the hand tools he set up their first metallurgy laboratory and introduced a process for induction hardening of cutter blades he became interested as well in the challenges of high temperature alloys with respect to their chemistry forgability and properties falih known to his friends and cohorts as doc left drop forge in about on leave of absence for the lewis flight propulsion laboratory of naca the national advisory committee for aeronautics now nasa in cleveland oh at naca he set up their first high temperature alloy development section for evaluating existing alloys and developing improved materials he believed that alloys depending on reactive elements such as titanium and aluminum for precipitation hardening could not be reliably made using conventional air melting techniques and that such alloys must be melted refined and poured under vacuum to realize their full potential he interested the writer who was working in naca s piston ring and cylinder barrel section in joining his group in to build a small vacuum furnace to melt alloy samples a small furnace was designed and built using two curtiss wright air cooled engine cylinder barrels welded end to end as the shell crucibles with a capacity of about grams were slip cast from beryllium oxide and resistance heated by a wound coil of molybdenum wire the chamber was evacuated with a mechanical pump backing a three stage all glass diffusion pump there was no capability to pour the melt into a mold and after a heat was made it was frozen in the crucible which had to be destroyed to reclaim the solidified casting despite the furnace limitations several heats of alloys which were then considered high temperature were made and examined metallographically during late and it is not known what if any mechanical testing was performed on these heats doc left naca in the fall of for an advisory position at the united states steel corp in new jersey until his return to drop forge as director of research in by this time the company was actively involved in forging gas turbine blades and buckets in their turbine parts division doc reported directly to the president willis v daugherty and was responsible not only for the metallurgical well being of the tool and turbine parts division but also for the evaluation and implementation of new processes which could improve quality and or productivity resistance heated upsetters and slow acting presses for forging high temperature alloys were two of the many processes he introduced he became assistant to the president in and vice president in during this period the turbine parts business expanded rapidly due to the advent of the korean war and the company produced parts for not only ge but curtiss wright and pratt and whitney the company s forging facilities expanded into a plant in whitestown and an extensive blade machining facility was set up in clayville one of pratt and whitney s engines the j used waspaloy for its bucket material and this alloy which has a fascinating legendary history was supplied to drop forge by allegheny ludlum universal cyclops and international nickel as bar stock from ten ton air melted heats the stress rupture specification for the as forged product was hours at psi and deg f a continual state of crisis existed in the turbine parts division since it was not possible to get consistent properties from heat to heat from the air melted stock ten ton heats were frequently rejected due to their inability to meet the hour stress rupture spec and this proved not only costly for all parties but raised havoc with production planning doc felt that the wide variations in the properties of the air melted heats was due to the inability to hold the amounts and ratio of the titanium and aluminum in the heats due to random oxidation he recommended to mr daugherty that drop forge consider setting up a vacuum melting facility to get into the production of improved materials in this immediate post world war ii period the air force frequently provided funding for the procurement of production equipment for installation in plants producing parts for the military much of the forging equipment and ancillary facilities for the turbine parts division of drop forge had been funded by such facilities contracts with the support of mr daugherty and the norris family which owned drop forge doc pushed for and succeeded in obtaining funds through an appendix to one such contract in for the procurement and installation of a pound and a pound vacuum induction melting furnace the total amount allotted amounted to this would give him the equipment necessary to pursue his theories regarding the potential benefits of vacuum melting chapter the clayville lab in late doc contacted the writer who had returned to the fairchild engine and aircraft corp after leaving naca and we met for dinner at the barclay in nyc he proceeded to describe his plans for setting up a laboratory operation with the aim of evaluating vacuum melting as a viable method of producing high temperature alloys with improved and consistent properties he indicated that the location and facilities would be somewhat crude with respect to those we had been used to at naca but that drop forge management and the air force were in full support of the venture doc has always had a persuasive charm and after minimal deliberation the writer accepted his offer to join drop forge to design procure and install the vacuum furnaces and ancillary equipment on march the writer started work with doc in setting up the lab at the clayville plant as mentioned above drop forge had moved its blade machining operation to a large vacant textile mill in clayville sophisticated broaches automatic grinders etc occupied the most recently built s portion of the complex but the original three story mill building circa on the northwest corner of the property was vacant this structure with thick stone walls and pane double hung windows typical of many such textile plants in the area was available to house the lab and offices a brick structure at right angles would be used for the machine shop and another brick building close by would be the melt shop the first item of business was the final design of the lb and lb furnaces which were to be built by distillation products industries in rochester soon to become consolidated vacuum it appeared that the earliest that delivery could be expected would be in the spring of after considerable review of the quoted equipment costs and negotiations with dpi it was determined that cuts could be made to free up enough money so that a smaller lb furnace could be built by us on a crash basis without exceeding the budgeted amounts on the appendix the design of the pounder started on or about april and the drawings were completed by early may utica steam engine built the shell base plate and cover dpi furnished the pumps and vacuum parts doc scavenged a kw generator from somewhere and the rest was built in house by ray decker our versatile machinist and si batson our mechanic who could cobble up most anything from bits and pieces lying around the old mill we learned how to leak check by squirting acetone on the suspect areas and watching for a minuscule rise on the pirani gage we couldn t afford a leak checker and large quantities of glyptol were used to plug up leaks duct seal wasn t invented yet the induction coil was rebuilt three times until we got a turns ratio that tuned efficiently but finally we were able to make the first heat aa on august only five months after the start of design there was an abundance of scrap waspaloy available as raw material in the form of bar stock from heats that hadn t met stress rupture specs and campaigns were run wherein this scrap was remelted and poured into tapered copper molds after removing the hot tops these ingots were fullered and flattened by drop forge and forged into j buckets various metallurgical treatments were tried including deoxidation with carbon and the addition of discrete amounts of titanium and aluminum to adjust the hardener ratio stress rupture tests were performed on the forged product on the dennison leeds machines doc got from england set up in the lab over the summer and run by kenny vincent who came over from drop forge wet chemistries were run by mert harrington in his new lab set up on benches bought knocked down from sears and put together by the whole crew on weekends metallography was done by bob kniffen and erwin deimal in a modest lab with sinks obtained from a garage sale in whitesboro the stress rupture results were truly amazing even by just remelting material which had originally failed the hour spec we were able to get rupture lives of over hours and what was equally gratifying was the consistency of properties in the remelted product doc was in close contact with p w and win sharp often visited clayville to follow the progress it did not take pratt long to issue po no req no a for j blade forgings coined to size from vacuum cast pwa b waspaloy on november just months after the first heat this order was filled one heat per blade commencing on december and completed in january pratt was nearly ecstatic with the properties of the resultant blades and more orders followed for similar product it then became a matter of how much can be produced and how fast the lb furnace was installed in the late spring of and the pounder followed a couple of months later these furnaces despite early problems with pumping and crucibles store bought monolithic were producing double or triple ingots weighing or pounds from scrap waspaloy by the end of the summer the lab was a true productive unit albeit small a few words are in order regarding the rest of the lab s activities during this period number furnace was kept busy evaluating new melting practices and developing potentially new alloys the first heats of what became known as udimet were melted during this period doc was also interested in the dynamics of the forging process and had brought over tony notaro to run forging tests on a small drop hammer instrumented with accelerometers and strain gages to monitor the stress strain curve during the forging process he was also interested in pursuing the potentials of powder metallurgy particularly in making intricate shapes such as milling cutters from carbides and he hired harry hamjian a powder metallurgist at naca in the summer of to set up a powder lab harry made some impressive products in a hot press set up by jack haggerty who joined us about that time and he and doc obtained patents on some of the techniques harry was switched from the powder work to run the vacuum melting production after the pounder came on line because of the demand for the waspaloy product ray zoeckler came over from drop forge and set up an experimental electrochemical machining device to finish blade surfaces roger loofburrow was hired from merck to set up the spec lab with a coffin like spectrograph ray ermacor joined us to help with a library and handle procurement bob kreimeyer ted hughes ray kluska worked with the furnaces gil dodge joined kenny in the creep room ed rice was our first draftsman and jean edick became doc s secretary in addition doc retained dr e s gene machlin who had worked with us at naca where he started work on his dislocation theories to assist in alloy development dr max gensamer was also retained to assist in mechanical metallurgy typical of the crises that confronted the operation during the first year was the relative lack of water for cooling of the furnaces the water supply for the clayville plant originated in a reservoir on the west side of the valley during winter and spring there was sufficient water to supply the town of clayville plus the drop forge operations but the summer of proved to be very dry the first operation to be curtailed was the vacuum melting which didn t set well with doc to keep running a well was drilled close to the furnace building and within a week an abundant vein was tapped which provided a real artesian well with water spouting a foot or more above the casing this was capped and provided all the water we needed from then on we even let the machining division use some of the surplus even before no and no furnaces were up and running doc felt that the potential of vacuum melting was such that more productive equipment would be required as supplement ix to an existing air force contract two pound furnaces were included along with support equipment the total amount for this equipment totaled this supplement was initiated in february accompanied by letters of support from c r skinner of p w and f p holter of curtis wright a letter from mr skinner to mr daugherty states our engine testing results indicate that a superior blade can be produced by this process and we have entered our order with you for forgings for the j engine which will require pounds of vacuum melted metal later he states complementing the above program which has resulted in approval of these forgings for production engines we are now most actively pursuing potential applications of this vacuum cast material to all models of our j engine design work started on these pound furnaces soon to become pounders by the time they were built f j stokes corp in philadelphia pa was selected to build and install them it soon became apparent that the clayville location was not large enough to accommodate these furnaces and a portion of the old oneida bleachery in new york mills was selected as a satisfactory site for the expanding operation chapter the move to new york mills the design of the furnaces for the new plant was somewhat unique it was evident that we could no longer efficiently utilize lb tapered ingots from heats as large as pounds one alternative was to pour two ingots of about pounds apiece the old s molds but these would have to be forged and rolled into barstock by an outside company another was to pour diameter rings centrifugally and cut them into wedge shaped pieces for subsequent forging to cover both bets the furnaces were designed to handle either method because of the mass of the centrifugal caster mold and poured ring the casters had to be mounted on massive concrete piers the caster shafts protruded through the walls of the diameter stationary covers which were affixed to the caster piers and sealed with diameter rotating seals the furnaces in diameter by long water cooled shells had to move on standard railroad rails to meet the stationary covers the booster pumps were hung on the sides of the shells and the capacitors were located on platforms at the rear of the shells cooling water and electric power were supplied via catenary loops and the waste water flowed into the rail channels and back to the recirculating system preliminary design work started in early and continued throughout the year a major crisis arose when ajax magnathermic withdrew their quotation to build the induction furnaces based on their feelings that there was no future for vacuum induction melting which would warrant their undertaking design of such large equipment tocco in ohio was selected as an alternate the final quoted amount for the two units complete with power supplies pumps and casters was about construction commenced in early while the new furnaces were being built at stokes work was underway to remodel the bleachery at new york mills to accommodate both the clayville equipment the new furnaces and a considerable list of new shop and test equipment including a direct reading spectrograph some square feet of production space and square feet of offices and labs were involved the move from clayville commenced in march and was finished by the end of april the first new furnace no arrived from stokes in august followed soon thereafter by its companion no the numbering was determined by the furnace location in the new melt shop there were the usual startup problems the most severe being the need to rework the kw hz supply from the capacitor rack to the induction coil but trial heats were made during the fall of and by december some heats had been made in no the rd and th heats were centrifugally cast pound diameter rings by early the plant was in full operation it was now known as the metals division of the utica drop forge and tool corp and doc was vice president and general manager the centrifugal castings had not proven a viable method of supplying forging stock due to heavy circumferential carbide segregation it was therefore necessary to go the forging bar rolling route and latrobe steel was the primary conversion source although other shops including vanadium alloys were also used scrap high temperature alloy was still the main raw material this scrap was obtained from low property air melted heats hot tops from our ingots flashing and scrapped forged blades and blades retired from engines this scrap utilization was not only beneficial from the raw material cost standpoint but also because it salvaged critical elements in alloys whose chemistries were such that they could not be recycled by air melting in fact this recycling aspect was a prime reason why the air force was so supportive of the process by december over pounds of waspaloy scrap had been melted in no and no furnaces using pounds of scrap or of the total charged weight with four furnaces in operation having a total capacity of lbs per month alloys other than waspaloy including m the nimonics and our newly developed u were added to the melt list ge lynn ge cincinatti allison and curtiss wright became end use customers using drop forge as the blade forging source no furnace was in constant use on alloy and process development and such techniques as shot pouring in vacuum were explored vacuum melting had become accepted in the gas turbine industry as the method to produce reliable blade material and business was booming it soon became apparent that the end of the scrap surplus was at hand and while there would always be some generated from hot tops flashing and bar ends virgin melts must be considered this brought on another crisis as we found that virgin heats did not produce consistently high stress rupture properties statistical analysis eventually showed that the best heats were the first melted in a new crucible and that properties deteriorated as more heats were melted in a campaign this led to the discovery that trace amounts of boron and zirconium were being leached from the new crucibles and giving the better properties to the first heats we did not know that the air melters had consistently added these elements to their waspaloy heats and using this scrap had automatically provided enough to keep the properties up the answer for the virgin heats of course was to add known quantities of boron and zirconium which led to a crash program using our new direct reading spectrograph and no furnace to determine the optimum amounts as approached it again became evident that the new york mills plant with its pound total melt capacity operated by some people would not be sufficient to produce the quantities of super alloys projected in the next few years and it was again necessary to consider new melting equipment although no were cranking out record amounts of material they had one serious drawback the single frequency hz heated beautifully but the four loop single phase power supply did not stir well this necessitated heating and cooling several times to adequately mix a heat before pouring which added considerable time to the melt cycle the writer had read of developments in air melt induction equipment by dr dreyfus at asea in sweden wherein dual frequencies were used hz for heating and hz for stirring these frequencies could be superimposed to give excellent temperature control plus the ability to stir at any desired rate asea was contacted and visited us at new york mills which resulted in a decision to explore the use of their technique the writer spent the summer of at asea in vasteras sweden directing the preliminary design of a pound furnace to be the largest vim furnace in the world at the same time the kelsey hayes co with headquarters in detroit mi was negotiating to buy drop forge the purchase became official in mid and as part of the agreement the metals division of utica drop forge and tool corp would become the metals division of kelsey hayes plans included the immediate building of a separate plant to house the existing equipment from new york mills as well as the new pound furnace being designed a new forging plant was also to be constructed for drop forge on halsey road in whitestown and at first it was proposed that the metals division would be located across the road and share the forge plant s substation doc would have absolutely no part of such an arrangement by this time sales had been developed with other forge shops and our customer and product base was expanding he felt that a plant in close proximity to halsey road would imply a captive shop which would severely hamper his sales plans he literally put his job on the line regarding this decision in a presentation proposed metals division expansion november doc clearly outlined the market potential goals and facility which would be required and succeeded in convincing both mr daugherty and messrs kennedy and williams of kelsey hayes that we must have a totally separate plant a search for property resulted in finding the middle settlement road site and doc negotiated the purchase of not only the plot presently owned by smc but the property up to clinton road and a swath up to seneca turnpike it was time to plan to move again chapter the early days at middle settlement road brown and mathews an architect engineering firm in nyc was retained to design the building and support facilities on the middle settlement road site they were to include a melt shop large enough for the present furnaces as well as the new furnaces there were to be two from asea as well as support operations generous lab and pilot plant facilities and reasonable office space it was to be located on the property such that it could be expanded as required and include in the near future a rolling mill the work proceeded at a rapid rate and construction commenced in the fall of it was ready for occupancy by april meanwhile the pound furnace had been designed at asea it was novel in several respects first it would include the dual frequency power supply second it would operate at over volts on the coil using a special insulation technique developed at asea third since it was to be of a two chamber configuration to permit mold setup independent of the melting cycle and had to accommodate a wide variety of mold configurations the writer adapted a design first used by mars in hungary in a lab furnace wherein the melt was poured through a hollow trunion into the mold chamber fourth in order to accommodate the diffusion booster pumps the writer employed a diameter manifold with pumps mounted on each side which tied in to the hollow trunion asea was responsible for the final design and construction of the furnaces chambers add maker pump manifold and power supply and f j stokes supplied the pumping system we could find no company who would be responsible for the design and construction of the large rotary seals which were vital to the operation joe byrne who we hired as project engineer for the furnace designed these seals and tested them on an eccentric jig on a large bullard boring mill they have proven to work without problems from their initial installation doc felt that while the proposed furnace would be ideal when fully debugged we should have a smaller conventional furnace just in case besides the projected business plan indicated that a pound furnace could be used effectively so the swedes were asked to furnish one in a horizontal tank with no frills except the dual frequency power supply this furnace was called no and was installed in early in the new plant meanwhile the rest of the new building with an area of about square feet was being readied for occupancy and the move from new york mills commenced in april the original departmental arrangement was as follows the melt shop contained no through furnaces located sequentially from south to north the centrifugal casters were eliminated when no were relocated and hinged covers were used assurance sales was located where rdh and pat s offices are and extended back through the present production control metallurgy was located where the cafeteria is at present the cafeteria was where the library is now the library was in the present conference room adjacent to the lobby a special chelation lab occupied the present human resources and engineering area no furnace was located where the computer room is now there was even a pistol shooting range in the present q a area the move proceeded in a well coordinated fashion and doc remarked later that one could not pinpoint the moving period from examination of production records before during and after the move no had some problems with insulation technique on a start up but the swedes quickly resolved them and the furnace soon became a dependable source of ingot products until its retirement in the s when lb ingots were no longer in demand no furnace was installed during the summer of and provided its share of startup difficulties on the first heat a pinhole leak in a water cooled copper wedge attached to an induction coil caused water to seep through the rammed lining to a point several inches below the melt surface the resultant steam explosion lifted a sheet of molten metal upwards to the cover causing badly shaken operators and observers on the platform but fortunately no physical harm or major equipment damage resulted after the mess was cleaned up the second heat was made without water cooled wedges and while pouring into two lb cast iron molds one of them split longitudinally when full the resultant diameter pancake welded to the mold table requiring considerable time to clean up and repair the third heat proceeded without problems until the pour when an inadvertently placed step ladder got entangled in the tilt cylinders which aborted the heat and raised doc s blood pressure after this rather ignominious start things proceeded in a more normal fashion and no soon became the company s workhorse it has continued to crank out metal for some thirty seven years changing in product from large ingots to remelt stock and being increased in size along the line its dual frequency melt stirring arrangement has been unsurpassed on any vacuum furnace later to be installed anywhere in the industry and considering its original installed cost of approximately it was one of the best investments ever made by the company by this time billet product was becoming a sizable fraction of the plant s output at first statically cast ingots were converted at cameron but problems persisted in ingot homogeneity elaborate programs were undertaken to produce static castings with better control of solidification but these did not prove very effective it was apparent that var melting was necessary to obtain an acceptable cast structure and we reluctantly resorted to toll var melting at latrobe as business continued to increase during the next two years it became evident that new capital investments would soon be needed if we were to maintain our leadership in the superalloy market the bar business still remained strong and it was apparent that we would have to have our own rolling facility an in house var capability was an eventual necessity and we would soon be running out of capacity again in vim particularly for electrode product although we had received excellent support from kelsey hayes they were reluctant for very sound reasons in providing the capital required for the major expansions necessary in an area in which they had little experience doc had an excellent rapport with both messrs kennedy chairman of the board and perry williams president and he got the approval to explore the possibilities of buying the company from kelsey hayes without going into the extensive and complex negotiations involved he succeeded in interesting white weld and lehman brothers in nyc in putting together a package of stock ownership wherein the company would be publicly owned we spent considerable effort in trying to come up with an appropriate name for the company using every synonym of vacuum alloy quality technical etc but as the day for closing the deal approached there was still no good candidate hearsay has it that when all parties were assembled for the final signing one of the signatories said we ve got to have a name on the documents let s call it special metals and thus came about the sm of the present smc chapter special metals inc things moved quickly when we became publicly owned but first a sidelight which occurred a year earlier in late in frequent visits to europe doc had developed a close rapport with m jean duval president of aubert et duval in france this resulted in the signing of an agreement for the exchange of certain technical information between the two companies in november of in paris this agreement led to visits of technical personnel from both companies which has continued for thirty five years the help which we received from visits to les ancizes on var rolling forging and melt practices over the years greatly assisted us in fields where we were just starting particularly in the selection and operation of new equipment and many technical and personal friendships resulted from the mutual interchanges of data the first equipment need to be addressed by the new company was a var furnace c after visits to the les ancizes plant a large hereaus furnace was ordered from hanau germany and installed in a new addition on the northwest of the melt shop we could now start supplying our own in house melted var ingots to the billet forgers across the country in we installed a lb furnace built by stokes this furnace no was a bit of a compromise we had wanted a unit with a separate mold chamber to reduce cycle time but budgetary considerations dictated a single tank arrangement which has plagued us ever since from the standpoint of overall efficiency it did however increase our electrode capacity at a time when it was sorely needed also in the same year we added c from hereaus as a mate to c to increase our var capacity bar rolling was still being tolled out and it was apparent that if we were to remain a dominant factor in this market we would have to have our own facility this was a tough call to make first the super alloy bar business was not a tonnage commodity in the parlance of the steel industry there would not be bread and butter rolling to help defray the capital costs and it would be essentially dedicated to a single product line second superalloy rolling required a gutsy cogging stand and a very tight and rugged finish train to meet the critical size requirements thirdly we didn t know a damned thing about rolling with the help of aubert et duval and visits to shops in sweden and wales we selected a rugged cogging stand and a three stand finish train without fancy repeaters etc this mill ordered from morgardshammer in sweden was delivered and installed in in the north east corner of what is now the bar mill aubert et duval supplied the roll pass designs used on their morgardshammer mill and these were of great help in getting us up and running without an extensive trial and error learning period the early s were a very busy time at special metals for business was not only growing but diversifying it was necessary to learn new processes such as var melting and bar rolling and to develop procedures and practices to accommodate the critical requirements of quality superalloys a cooperative team effort developed among the production sales metallurgical technical engineering and staff personnel which resulted in solving the problems at hand and developing quality products which put the company in the lead as the largest and best in the vacuum melting industry then came the cancellation of the dynosoar and b projects which seriously impacted the sales picture for the immediate future while we had experienced the cyclical nature of the industry in the past and ridden with the punches the bankers behind special metals were shaken when had to be written off on rene and losses hit on sales of million for fiscal year june to may it was apparent that the company needed the financial support of a metals orientated organization more familiar with the unique requirements of our industry doc set about locating a potential buyer and after early discussions with latrobe succeeded in selling the company to allegheny ludlum in the company whose scrap waspaloy helped put us in business to start with chapter early smc days with allegheny ludlum under allegheny ludlum whose management at that time recognized the peculiar requirements of a specialty alloy producer special metals corp again flourished almost immediately plans were made to start the design of a lb furnace which would more than double our vim capacity the writer recalls a staff luncheon with ed hanley al s chairman of the board when doc asked me how much a new lb furnace would cost after roughly defining the scope i picked a number of million out of the air and within a matter of weeks was given the go ahead to set up the project it was unique from the standpoint that i don t think a detailed appropriation request was ever generated and circulated for approval it was a case of we need it design it build it and fast while we retained mcknight kirmse and french to design the building the need was so urgent that it was constructed on a time and material basis to eliminate the time normally required for bidding ajax magnethermic was selected as the prime contractor for the new furnace based on their developments in induction power supplies since the days when they had refused to consider powering the lb furnaces the chambers and pumps were sub contracted to temescal who sub contracted the steam ejectors to elliot several design criteria were set including a separate mold chamber capable of handling the longest conceivable electrode molds as well as a pony ladle for pouring if desired two six stage steam ejector systems one for the melt chamber and one for the mold chamber with inter connectibility a power supply which would permit both heating and stirring and an overhead charge chamber with a locking system the furnace was literally designed on the fly with a team of temescal designers in residence in a trailer on seneca turnpike to turn out drawings as we finalized design features the mold chamber underwent many changes before a satisfactory arrangement was developed and the split melt chamber with a center section holding the coil assembly to facilitate quick crucible changes was added as an after thought the melt shop mold area and charge make up buildings were erected during the winter of which was more severe than normal and by spring the steam ejectors boilers and cooling towers were in place the furnace was erected during the summer and fall and the first heats were made before the end of the year no was not unique in one respect it had its share of start up problems which continued through the first half of the brick furnace lining overheated yokes and various electrical switching problems come to mind but they were systematically solved june was a hot month and we found the bac cooling towers would not provide sufficient cool water for the steam ejector condensers these were replaced by bac and by the fall we were getting reasonable productivity from the new installation the latter half of the s saw the installation of other new equipment as well and the development of new processing techniques in vim and var melting as well as conversion and finishing without pinpointing the exact dates the following efforts are examples additional var furnaces were required to keep up with the increased vim capacity two consarc var furnaces were procured from jay wooding they were installed as c and c in a pit by the hereaus furnaces which was no longer needed for silo cooling of electrodes they were the first to incorporate jay s co axial method of power supply to reduce asymmetric magnetic fields and reduce ingot defects attributed to pool stirring to further increase var capacity a wing was built to the west of the hereaus furnaces and three hereaus var furnaces which we had been using for toll melting at wyman gordon were installed our observers had noticed pool stirring at wyman which resulted in ingot defects and a magnetic survey had confirmed the asymmetry during the move some major modification in the support structures and power feeds were incorporated to partially eliminate asymmetric fields it is understood that even today some problems exist however which precludes their use for certain grades var melt controls were studied in detail soon after our acquisition by allegheny a joint program was set up between our var shop and the one at watervliet we had developed a program to melt defect free a which watervliet needed and breckenridge s electronics group had developed the hash control for arc gap we soon acquired the necessary electronics to evaluate the control and eventually incorporated it on all var furnaces arc gap controls underwent many revisions during the next five years as improved electronics and control philosophies evolved this was before the days of the micro processor so the control and analysis of results was tedious after trying many approaches including jay s phantom shorts we settled on the robicon control until the computer age arrived ten years later billet conversion was still a toll process doc wanted our own in house forging facility and many discussions were had with sack and gfm trying to find equipment which we could afford meanwhile our observers were busy at toll forge shops which eventually included the dunkirk press shop owned by allegheny and subsequently sold to ajax forging and casting this then became the prime conversion source the bar mill underwent considerable expansion during this period the centro maskin grinder was installed as well as much more support equipment for heating finishing and inspection remelt product was supplied as it is today from statically cast ingots chuck yaker of misco and doc both felt that continuous casting in vacuum had a potential as a more efficient production method our first venture into this area took place around with some trial heats in a small set up in no furnace the results showed enough promise to expand the project to larger heats no furnace was selected for the trials and a well drilling rig was moved in to the melt shop with its boom over the forward part of the furnace a well was drilled over feet deep and a large casing was installed within that casing a vacuum tight pipe was placed and attached to the bottom of an enlarged section of the melt chamber this became the run out container for continuously cast ingots using a specially designed casting station the resultant product had to be pulled up to the roof of the melt shop and maneuvered over to the cut off area where it was cut and processed the process worked although it was not particularly elegant the metallurgical results were less conclusive at that time some heats tended to wet the crucible during the investment casting process and it appeared that the continuously cast product was more prone to this phenomenon many heats were made and tested before the process was finally abandoned there is still some question regarding the wetability but it is a moot point now many projects were proceeding in the technical department at this time including both alloy and process development i am not familiar with most of these so cannot accurately describe the details but powder making was tried as well as the melting of nitinol a process was even explored for making the balls for ball point pens it was an active period of diverse experimentation the plant was running out of space to house the increased salaried force which was required in all departments so the first section of the present process lab was built and the equipment from the pilot plant in the east wing of the main plant was moved over this wing was remodeled to provide the offices for the departments which essentially remain there today with a few exceptions the library was moved from the front to a portion of the area now occupied by metallurgy with facilities engineering occupying the remainder the main lobby was where the conference room next to purchasing is now and all personnel entered through it with the exception of the staff this proved unwieldy and was later eliminated in addition the present entrance road and guard house were constructed heretofore the entrance road came off middle settlement close by the grove of maples on the south east corner of the property and there was no guard house just prior to the erection of the var expansion the substation which was about where c to c now stand had to be moved to its present location this was done during a two week vacation shut down and was a beautifully coordinated effort on the part of facilities engineering of course there were continual changes in the front office layout and the writer has regretted many times the decision to make the original offices from cinder block the topsy like growth in this area raised havoc with the heating air conditioning systems as well a fact with which i am sure everyone will agree chapter the decade of the seventies during the next decade smc reached maturity it acquired facilities to make it independent of toll services expanded its product lines weathered more business cycles and saw a change in leadership with doc s retirement several of the major highlights are described below misco and doc still felt that remelt stock could be made more efficiently by a continuous casting process and a new approach was tried in the chadwicks project this involved feeding a continuous caster with molten metal from a consumably melted ingot and withdrawing it through a dynamic seal and cutting it to length the equipment was designed in house by the engineering department and installed in a vacant building leased from central steel erecting in chadwicks it consisted of an upper chamber containing the electrode with necessary feed ram a transition chamber with a water cooled copper hearth from which the melted metal would flow through a funnel type tundish into the lower chamber here an oscillating continuous caster with dummy billet withdrawal rolls and water cooled cooling clamps solidified the ingot which exited through a three stage vacuum pumped dynamic seal to a traveling saw which cut the ingot and dispatched it by a conveyor lift to floor level the control of the ram drive melting power mold oscillation ingot withdrawal and saw action had to be closely coordinated and before the days of microprocessors this was a difficult challenge after various modifications including an induction heated tundish and a barrier diaphragm to isolate the upper sections in vacuum from the withdrawal chamber operated in a partial pressure of helium successful castings were made as a production operation however it was not a dependable process the main difficulties arose in trying to maintain a constant flow of metal from the tundish where wandering streams and icicles precluded the constant metal flow so necessary for continuous casting many tundish modifications were tried but none proved truly successful and funds for further development were eventually withdrawn in retrospect the process still has potential and with a controlled secondary heat source perhaps electron beam to provide a steady flow and the use of today s computer technology it might prove viable in the early s it suddenly became apparent that the days of unlimited energy were a thing of the past the unlimited supplies of per mcf natural gas which had been touted when no was installed suddenly disappeared there were curtailments during the winter months which forced the shutdown of the furnace and prices naturally rose at the same time the electric energy rates started to increase annually as a result smc became an active participant in the multiple intervenors a group of industries in upstate ny which contested niagara mohawk s rate cases and their effect on industry this group was very effective in using qualified rate case experts at hearings with the new york state psc to present industry s side of the testimony as a result rate increases were kept in line and substantial savings in electrical energy costs were realized a second result of the energy crunch was the formation of the joint energy task force of which smc was a co founder along with revere copper and brass this group fostered energy conservation programs within house and for other industries throughout the mohawk valley area annual energy conservation projects became a standard part of smc s planning with substantial capital expenditures allotted for those with potential paybacks of three years or less the task force also successfully challenged a potential promulgation by the psc which would have required a stationary engineer around the clock on boilers such as those used on no one of the larger conservation projects involved the pumping system on no while the steam ejectors were very effective in pumping the chambers they were atrociously inefficient it was determined that large roots blowers would be more economical in maintaining operating pressures once the chambers had been roughed down with the hoggers and first steam ejector stages four large blowers were thus installed in the late s with an attractive payback at the prevailing natural gas prices and availability doc retired in the middle of the decade and his retirement party on march was attended not only by smc employees but many former associates customers and industry leaders to pay him tribute for his visions leadership and entrepreneurial abilities which resulted in a company internationally renowned as the leader in the vacuum melting industry nineteen years later doc and his wife andray reside in andorra and his enthusiasm for technology and life in general continues unabated his current challenge is the mastering of a pentium computer bob halverstadt took over the presidency of smc on doc s retirement and under his very able leadership the company continued to expand not only in the existing product lines but into new materials and markets as well he moved on to become president of the materials technology group of allegheny international in and john pridgeon became smc s executive vice president and general manager billet conversion continued at ajax s press in dunkirk but smc continually searched for a more elegant in house method several evaluations of forging machines were made on both gfm facilities one developed by sack in witten germany as well as at sandvik steel in sweden the results on the sack machines showed considerable promise since the hydraulic action of the four dies gave remarkable hot work penetration many proposals were made for a facility using this technique once in partnership with wyman gordon a second time with ajax and third on our own wherein a large sack machine could have been procured and installed for a ridiculously low price unfortunately for varying reasons none of the proposals were approved later in the decade john pridgeon smc s vice president of technology became president of ajax several of that company s operations were sold and emphasis was placed on rehabilitating the dunkirk press plant the ton lake erie forging press which had been a state of the art facility when it was built in had suffered severely from lack of maintenance during ajax s previous management as had the furnace equipment under the direction of smc the press was completely disassembled reworked and rebuilt new wepuko pumps replaced the original dennisons a new hydraulic system was installed and computer control was incorporated using pressure systems inc as the contractor the furnaces were rebuilt and insulated with modern refractories and the overhead charger a vital part for fast material transfer was refurbished the press rebuild took place from late november to february after which smc had a reliable means of conversion although it was still hampered by a single manually operated manipulator of rather ancient vintage in early it became apparent that an electroslag remelting furnace was needed for some alloy grades in which smc and allegheny had mutual interests after some deliberation an order was placed with jay wooding who had left consarc and had formed his own design company the project was plagued with problems from the outset primarily because the furnace incorporated so many potential capabilities it was an almost universal design its features were to include the capability to melt in the direct current mode with bipolarity and in an alternating current mode as well the capability of melting both in air as well as in a controlled atmosphere the capability of melting both slabs and cylindrical ingots in a two station arrangement since bottom poured slag through a mouse hole was not permitted because this patent was held by jay s former company consarc a cumbersome top pouring system was required this also necessitated the use of an expensive starter plate the copper crucibles were to be electron beam welded the cooling water flow through the annulus was to be much greater than usually employed suffice it to say that this was an overly ambitious undertaking for both smc who had little practical knowledge of esr melting and jay who had great ambitions but minimal staff to undertake a venture with the above complexities as a result after many delays in construction and installation it did produce conventional heats but most of the frills were never used its overall design was just too complicated for efficient operation the making of superalloy powder continued to be of interest after joe wentzel left to set up his own company an experimental setup was tried in no furnace wherein metal was poured on the surface of a cylinder rotating on a horizontal axis the resultant solidified splatter produced some fines but the majority was flakes a second process was explored in which molten metal was poured onto a rapidly spinning cup this was set up in the bluebird a large tank in the process lab the resultant powder was finer in mesh but yields of useable material were still not impressive difficulties also arose in trying to maintain a controlled metal flow to the cup and its rotational speed was less than optimal powder producing became a reality when the princeton ky and ann arbor mi facilities of the federal mogul corp were acquired by smc in this acquisition of a highly respected producer of both superalloy powder as well as dental alloys expanded our product base in two attractive areas the previous history of these plants as well as a summary of their remarkable progress since the acquisition are too lengthy to cover here it is hoped that they will be sequentially documented by some of the old timers at princeton or ann arbor before memories become too hazy during the seventies the process lab formerly the pilot plant was expanded in size and new equipment was added including d furnace to replace the original no furnace as a more state of the art unit for alloy development d furnace which was a modification of no with improved power supply stirring and pumping no furnace remodeled to provide centrifugal castings for rocket nozzles for the space shuttle vader melting facilities first as a pilot unit and later as a full scale machine to consumably melt axially opposed electrodes and cast the metal statically or continuously powder making facilities moved from ann arbor as well as the bluebird in asm international designated no furnace an historical landmark and it was located by the flagpole in front of the main offices of smc an accompanying plaque states in first commercial vacuum melting induction furnace for production of superalloys vim processing upgraded the quality of existing alloys and made possible production of stronger more ductile superalloys containing higher percentages of reactive elements closing thoughts the preceding chapters give only a few of the highlights of smc s fascinating history as i indicated in the introduction the events described primarily cover equipment or process related activities and i am sure i have omitted many which should have been included unfortunately little has been said about sales and markets technical and alloy development production practices financial details personnel and management organization these areas are equally fascinating but i am not qualified to document their highlights perhaps they may be summarized by someone before the records are lost with a few exceptions i have refrained from mentioning specific individuals after the clayville days i was often tempted to include many people in various departments who were so instrumental to smc s development but i could not include them all and did not want to slight anyone i have ended the history on or about the start of the s and i feel i have not done justice to the era under bob halverstadt s leadership the company by this time had reached maturity in its conventional superalloy product lines and bob led the way to diversification into sophisticated powder metallurgical products various joint ventures capital expansions and departmental reorganizations to maintain smc s leadership in a field which had become intensely competitive the days of just adding new equipment to keep up with the demand were over and elaborate marketing financial production and engineering studies were required before a sound capital investment could be justified his engineering and business background combined with an unflagging enthusiasm for cutting edge technology helped maintain smc s position in the industry the succeeding fifteen years have been equally interesting with changes in ownership and management as well as some important facility additions and product line changes it is hoped that someone will document the highlights of this period to bring the history of special metals up to date introduction news facilities products

southern peru copper shareholders elect directors hear recap of outstanding year new york n y april southern peru copper corporation spcc had an outstanding year in with record sales and profits increased production lower costs and robust metals prices that was the message from spcc president and chief executive officer charles g preble at spcc s shareholder meeting here yesterday at the meeting common stockholders of spcc elected ambassador everett e briggs president of the americas society and the council of the americas and john f mcgillicuddy former chairman of the board and chief executive officer of chemical banking corporation to represent them for one year terms common shareholders have a interest in spcc elected directors by the class a common stockholders were richard de j osborne kevin r morano augustus b kinsolving francis r mcallister robert j muth robert m novotny michael o varner david b woodbury jay a pritzker robert a pritzker douglas c yearley j steven whisler and charles g preble class a common stock is held by the founding shareholders of spcc asarco incorporated holds of spcc a subsidiary of the marmon corporation owns and phelps dodge overseas trading company owns coopers lybrand was elected to serve as independent auditors for the company preble told shareholders that in spcc accomplished a major corporate restructuring with the issuance of new common shares in exchange for existing labor shares completed most of its million expansion and modernization program and doubled its proven and probable copper ore reserves spcc s net earnings before nonrecurring items were million or per share compared with million in or per share nonrecurring items of million in related to sales of noncore assets earnings in the first quarter of were million or cents per common share compared with proforma earnings of million for the first quarter of or cents per share adjusted to reflect the labor share exchange as if it had occurred on january the board of directors declared a dividend of cents per common share payable june to shareholders of record at the close of business on may according to preble southern peru successfully completed its offer to exchange new common shares for existing labor shares at the end of labor shares had been issued to workers beginning in the s under prior peruvian law and were actively traded on the lima stock exchange more than of the total labor shares were exchanged and spcc common shares now are traded both on the new york stock exchange and the lima stock exchange preble said that spcc is nearing completion of its million capital spending program which is designed to integrate the company s operations expand production modernize equipment and add additional environmental facilities spcc s purchase of the government s ilo refinery made spcc an integrated copper producer and lowered the company cash cost of producing copper by more than cents per pound steps also have been taken to expand production preble said new sx ew facilities are now in operation and we produced our first cathode in the fourth quarter of we expect to produce tons of copper per year at a cost of under cents per pound which will reduce our total average costs by five cents a pound spcc s cash costs which were per pound in fell to cents in and cents in our costs in were favorably affected by the very high molybdenum by product credits caused by high molybdenum prices in with the new low cost sx ew production and a molybdenum by product credit based on a molybdenum price we expect cash costs to be cents per pound spcc increased its production in over s production to tons in production will increase another due primarily to the new sx ew production silver and molybdenum production also has increased along with the higher copper production preble said that spcc has made substantial expenditures to further protect the environment the company spent million for the construction of a sulfuric acid plant at the ilo smelter which was inaugurated january th of this year and is constructing a new tailings disposal system to be completed in late spcc s board of directors approved plans to spend an additional million to expand the acid plant expansion of the plant will further reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from the smelter and will improve the ambient air quality preble told shareholders that spcc s ore reserves also have increased at the end of southern peru s proven and probable reserves totaled billion tons of sulfide reserves and million tons of leachable reserves additionally million tons of mineralized material is now being evaluated with significant new reserves at both cuajone and toquepala mine expansions are a real opportunity we are considering an increase in mine production of as much as tons per year or about preble said because the new reserves are contiguous to the existing pits most of the infrastructure necessary for large mining operations already is in place we have a detailed expansion study underway which should be completed later this year major mine expansions preble continued would require an expansion of smelting and refining capacity our current smelter was built with s technology and modernized with the addition of a teniente converter and an acid plant we currently process million tons of concentrate at the smelter mine expansions would clearly dictate an increase in the size of our existing smelting capacity preble said a new smelter would use modern flash smelting technology and would include a sulfur recapture rate at international standards we have not decided whether such a plant would be built on a greenfield site or whether some portion of the existing plant would be retrofitted the cost of such a plant would certainly exceed million we will also consider an expansion of the ilo refinery preble said that while the total cost of such an expansion would be significant construction would be phased in over a period of years we will need committed financing before we begin construction and we will look to commercial banks multilateral agencies and other lenders including the public capital markets to participate preble said preble said that the investment climate in peru is good elections last year gave the present administration a clear mandate to continue reforms the government had begun the economy in peru continued to improve in gdp grew by and inflation was the lowest in years spcc is the largest mining company in peru and operates two mines a smelter and a refinery in the southern

basic.materials.sector	date thu nov gmt server stronghold ben ssl apache content type text html content length last modified thu nov gmt news and information by michael zasowski manufacturing engineering supervisor williams has recently introduced its new microlidtm a low cost alternative to the traditional frame lid assembly driven by the booming demand for personal mobile communication devices the microlidtm was designed for use to hermetically seal packages which contain surface acoustical wave or saw devices since its advent williams has found this technology beneficial in many other applications as well the traditional frame lid assembly or fla is manufactured by resistance welding a solder frame preform to a plated lid the lid is stamped from an feni or fenico alloy and is electroplated first with a layer of ni then with a layer of au the fact that the frame and lid are manufactured separately and assembled in a final operation leads to a labor intensive process the process used to manufacture the microlidtm takes advantage of williams cladding technology cladding is the process of bonding two or more metals together by the application of pressure and heat base metal that has been preplated with ni and au is bonded to a layer of solder the composite is then rolled down to the desired finish thickness and the part with the required dimensions is stamped from the material this process affords tremendous gains in efficiency and allows williams to offer a product at a greatly reduced price depending on the part size a microlidtm may be as much as less than the traditional fla because the preform is not in the shape of a frame but a solid preform there is a break even point where this type of lid would no longer be cost effective typically where part sizes below square are required a microlidtm will offer significant cost savings the microlidtm also provides a more cost effective and thinner design versus ceramic lid options a microlidtmcan be engineered to fit a specific application and meet cost or performance goals au and ni plating thickness can be customized as well as the type of base metal and the finish thickness of the package ausn solder may be replaced with ausn to further reduce costs the thickness of the solder can be specified down to with overall package thickness as low as hermeticity and solderability performance is equal to the traditional fla because the edges are not fully plated corrosion resistance is slightly less to alleviate this problem williams offers a au overflash to protect the edges from excessive corrosion williams has been an industry leading supplier of quality frame lid assemblies for over years development of the microlidtm represents our continued support to this market by joe alfano product manager williams has been a supplier of precious metals for over years in the hybrid microelectronics dental and optical media markets we have supplied limited materials to the vacuum tube

martinez pvd product manager to meet the challenges of the new cd r and dvd era williams has been working diligently to provide processes and materials that optimize our customers returns most recently williams introduced sfgtm super fine grain targets to the thin film industry this unique approach offers our customer industry leading sputtering yields and maximum return on investment the requirements of modern thin film process especially optical films for low particles superior uniformity and desirable deposition rates have revised the way targets perform in any sputtering process targets today have been engineered on their physical appearance as well as their microstructural design williams currently controls metallographic grain size and orientation through specific pouring speeds temperatures rolling reduction techniques and specific annealing temperatures these manufacturing processes have shown to be crucial inoptimizing target and magnetron performance the crystal structure of precious metals and some base or closed packed hexagonal are either face centered cubic fcc closed packed hexagonal although a truly random arrangement is difficult to achieve williams new manufacturing approach provides metallurgical grains with random alingment williams has identified the following correlating relationships between target texture to sputtering performance sputtering rates increases in closed packed directions and also improves in transfer coefficient ratio of material deposited into the substrate and outside substrate base williams sfgtm targets have randomly positioned grains optimizing the relationship between ejection angle and the amount of atoms ejected normal to the substrate during sputtering with grain size less than u sputtering rates can be improved by over from a standard u grain target also yields per energized ion increase showing an important impact on sputtering rates these target properties clearly indicate an improvement in film uniformity on full face erosion profile targets in addition its important to mention that through small grain targets the impedance of the target will be improved helping the process to run cooler and efficiently through control of crystal orientation and grain size in planar targets sputtered film thickness uniformity can be significantly better than our new sfgtm manufacturing

report optical cable corporation occf otc m initiating coverage with a buy recommendation wk range shares out mm mkt cap mm hist p e range n m long term debt cap nil dividend yield nil yr est growth q q q q year p e prv est street x e a a x e x e x summary optical cable corporation based in roanoke virginia manufactures and markets a broad line of fiber optic cable used primarily to transmit data voice and video information the company is the second largest supplier of tight buffered fiber optic cable in the moderate distance market segment comprising cable runs up to ten miles the use of fiber optic cable has increased as the cost effectiveness of the technology has improved and the demand for higher capacity communications circuits has increased in the worldwide market for fiber optic cable was about billion and growing about per year optical cable corporation occ has focused on a segment of the market that addresses cable runs of less than ten miles and includes the wiring used to carry data in local area networks lans telephone company local loops and cable tv systems by addressing this niche market occ has been able to grow somewhat faster than the overall market or about per year over the last two years to million in sales in with a differentiated product and a proprietary low cost manufacturing technology we believe that occ is well positioned to continue increasing its share of a market that we expect to continue growing at or above the current rate we are initiating coverage of optical cable corporation with a buy recommendation a well established market trend the increasing use of fiber optic transmission facilities in communications networks is well established we believe the need for increased communications bandwidth will continue to drive this major technology trend positioned to take market share occ has positioned itself in the fastest growing niche market in the fiber optic cable market with a proprietary manufacturing process and a superior product we believe occ is well positioned to accelerate its market share gains accelerating earnings growth we believe occ s accelerating share gain will translate into a higher rate of growth for the company we forecast an increase from the sales growth that has characterized the company recently to per year or better purchase recommended we are initiating coverage of occ with a buy recommendation our month price target is background the advantages of optical fiber as a communications medium has been recognized since the technology was developed in the mid s but the cost of the optical fiber and the associated electronics prevented its deployment until the mid s when single mode fiber optic systems began to be installed in the long distance transmission facilities of the telephone companies essentially all terrestrial and submarine communication systems now use fiber optic cables and as the economics have continuously improved and the demand for bandwidth has increased fiber optic cable is being used in more and more applications the main advantage of optical fiber as a communications medium is its high transmission capacity also known as bandwidth compared to the highest speed copper cables a fiber optic cable has thousands of times the information carrying capacity while occupying less space and operating more reliably over longer distances in addition it is immune to electromagnetic interference and electrical surges because it does not carry electricity it is safer in flammable environments it also offers higher security since it is difficult to tap without detection the economics of fiber optic systems have improved steadily allowing the use of fiber optic cable in more and more applications formerly served by copper in the future we expect that optical fiber will be widely deployed not only in long distance telephone circuits but also in telephone company local loops commercial buildings cable tv systems and data networks including lans and campus wide networks gigabit ethernet the next high speed data networking technology requires fiber optic cable to operate over any meaningful distance the market opportunity the world market for fiber optic cable in was about billion and has been growing at about per year this market is comprised of two main forms of fiber optic cable single mode and multi mode for long distance transmission single mode is the preferred technology offering high capacity and low attenuation over long distances the associated electronics and connectors are expensive but since the typical system has long cable runs between the electronics the economics of the system remain attractive single mode fiber currently represents about of the unit volume of fiber optic cable and about of the dollar volume the largest application for single mode fiber optic cable is in long distance terrestrial and submarine telephony applications in the market for single mode fiber optic cable was about billion with a projected growth rate of about per year multi mode fiber offers advantages in applications where the transmission distances are shorter than in the long distance market the electronics and connectors for multi mode fiber are less expensive thus improving the economics of a system such as a lan where compared to a long distance installation there is relatively more in the way of electronics and connectors and less in the way of optical fiber the lower unit volume of fiber optic cable used in these mostly medium distance applications is reflected in a lower share of the overall market in the market for multi mode fiber optic cable was about billion with a projected growth rate of about per year optical cable corporation optical cable corporation was founded in by two engineers who had been responsible for the government funded fiber optic cable development work at the itt electro optical products division in roanoke virginia during the late s and early s itt captured nearly all of the government funded r d programs for development of fiber optic components and systems including the development of extremely strong lightweight and rugged fiber optic cable for military use from its inception occ pioneered the use of military tactical cable technology combined with advanced manufacturing techniques to offer new cable designs specifically optimized for the requirements of moderate distance lan installations this cable differed significantly from the cable being manufactured by the major suppliers for the long distance market because the early single mode fiber was relatively brittle and subject to damage through rough handling the manufacturers of single mode cable adopted a technology known as gel filled loose tube gflt in which the fiber strands float in a viscous gel inside a hard outer casing produced in large volume and cost effective for long distances such as between cities gflt cable is difficult to use and expensive to terminate the majority of fiber optic cable produced today is still gflt although it is losing share to a newer technology using technology that had been developed for tactical military cable occ pioneered the production of a tight buffered design in which the outer jacket of the cable is extruded under high pressure directly over the cable s core resulting in a cable that is more flexible and more durable than the gel filled cables and also permits a simpler and less expensive method of termination unlike the gel filled cable which cannot be used indoors because of the volatility of the gel filling the occ tight buffered cable can be used both indoors and outdoors markets the introduction of occ s improved optical cable coincided with the rapid growth of networking and the company found a ready market for its products in the wiring of buildings for local area networks to date optical fiber has been used mainly for network backbones using fddi fiber distributed data interface a technology built around optical fiber as a transmission medium with the advent of additional high speed backbone technologies such as atm and gigabit ethernet both of which require the higher bandwidth provided by optical fiber the market for fiber optic cable in lans is expected to show dramatic growth over the next several years in addition to lans we expect occ s tight buffered cable to find additional applications in the medium distance fiber optic cable market defined as cable spans less than ten miles we believe gflt fiber optic cable will remain the dominant product in long haul telephone networks the large cable manufacturers have significant manufacturing capacity committed to gflt technology and the high volume insures a low unit cost however over shorter distances where installation and termination costs are a larger part of the overall system expense tight buffered cable while more expensive than gflt on a unit basis can often achieve a lower total installed system cost other applications included in this market sector include the local loop of the telephone network cable tv systems building and campus communication systems and traffic control systems about half of the fiber optic cable used in the medium distance market today is gflt cable for lan applications currently represents about of occ s business with industrial applications another video about and military less than single mode cable is currently about one third of occ s business and is growing faster than multi mode cable as its use increases in the telephone company local loop catv systems and among oem manufacturers in the telecommunications equipment market who use it for terminations jumpers and patch panels associated with their fiber optic system components the telephone company local loop which represents about of the cable footage in the telephone system represents the largest potential future market this market has not yet developed as the installed copper plant upgraded with electronics such as digital subscriber loop carrier xdsl appears to still meet the demands of the local loop however over time as the demand for bandwidth in the local loop continues to increase and the economics of fiber optic systems continues to improve this market could be substantial products with its highly flexible manufacturing facility occ can manufacture literally thousands of different fiber optic cables to meet the exact specifications of a particular job the product line is described in a detailed page catalog which allows the customer to define the exact specifications required for an application the company offers three distinct types of cable construction in three basic cable styles using both single mode and multi mode optical fiber rather than limiting its customers to just standard products the company will also help customers identify special requirements and will supply appropriately designed products occ believes its tightly buffered cable provides at least eight advantages over its competition better protection in wet environments resulting in longer life and increased reliability proof testing at higher stress levels to provide longer cable life an exclusive cable jacket design that provides better crush and impact protection and improved tear resistance during installation a improvement in temperature range lower termination costs flame retardant materials and design dual indoor outdoor use and higher density packaging resulting in the smallest band radius in the industry in addition to its standard and custom cables occ also manufactures private label cables for customers and competitors in other segments of the fiber optic cable market distribution the company sells direct to the u s government original equipment manufacturers and some regional bell operating companies but about of occ s sales are through national distributors such as graybar anicom and wesco as well as strong regional datacomm distributors the company has a person outside sales force managed by three regional vice presidents whose job is to develop sales situations for the company s distributors this organization is supported by six inside salespeople who take orders and provide quotes and twelve sales associates who leverage the outside sales force by looking for new business opportunities for the sales force to call on outside the u s occ also sells through distributors occ s international sales were about of total sales in and are expected to increase to or more over the next two years the foreign manufacturers of fiber optic cables have benefitted for years by the price protection afforded by the state owned telecommunications authorities with the advent of deregulation around the world and especially in europe these protected competitors with essentially non competitive plants are expected to lose market share to u s competitors we further expect occ to gain market share from its u s competitors as it has been doing in the market for tight buffered cable in no single customer accounted for more than of its net sales although one distributor accounted for about of sales the company does business with over three thousand customers and over of the orders are under thousand both of these factors tend to stabilize order flow sales are somewhat seasonal with softer business in the first two quarters due to the impact of winter weather on outside construction revenue in each quarter results from orders received in that quarter and the backlog is not indicative of future sales competition the largest competitor for fiber optic cable is copper wire the established legacy technology while fiber optic cable has shown dramatic growth over the last ten years it has had an insignificant impact on the growth of the market for copper based cables this will continue to be true for the foreseeable future even as the economics of optical fiber continue to improve and the demand for increased bandwidth grows within the overall fiber optic cable market gflt technology represents the largest competitive product among the suppliers of fiber optic cable siecor a joint venture between siemens and corning and lucent are the leading manufacturers of fiber optic cable for both the long distance telephone and the moderate distance market although fglt cables represent the largest part of both siecor s and lucent s production both also manufacture tight buffered fiber optic cable for the moderate distance market occ believes that it is the second largest supplier to the tight buffer moderate distance market behind siecor and that it has been growing faster than siecor for the last several years occ believes that it can achieve the leading share of this market in the next several years with continued market share gains in the u s and an aggressive expansion of its international business manufacturing manufacturing consists of applying a variety of raw plastic materials to optical fibers the key material in this process is optical fiber which the company obtains from several suppliers including spectran corning lucent and alcatel corning and lucent dominate the world market for optical fiber with a combined market share estimated to be over the company maintains multiple sources for all of its raw materials because all of its optical fiber suppliers are also competitors in the market for finished fiber optic cable occ has considered from time to time integrating backwards into the manufacture of its own optical fiber while none of the company s current manufacturing processes or products are protected by patents the company believes that its proprietary knowledge with respect to the development and manufacture of fiber optic cables is a significant competitive advantage the company also believes that its computer controlled manufacturing equipment which is developed by the company and manufactured to its specifications enables the company to produce fiber optic cable of higher quality and at lower cost than its competitors all the company s manufacturing processes meet required worldwide standards and its quality management system is certified to meet iso the current plant while operating at a high level of efficiency has substantial excess capacity as a result of a capacity expansion completed in january that enables the company to respond quickly to special customer requirements and will enable the company to accommodate sales growth going forward management and corporate developments robert kopstein chairman of the board president and chief executive officer founded the company in as a partnership with a fellow engineer from the itt electro optical products division in roanoke virginia both had had extensive experience in the development of optical fiber technology for military applications mr kopstein bought out his partner on june and operated the business as a subchapter s corporation until the company s public offering on april unable to obtain a satisfactory underwriting commitment from the investment banking community the company advertised and successfully executed its own public offering selling million shares of the company s common stock from which it received net proceeds of approximately million the company currently has about million shares outstanding of which mr kopstein owns or million shares the remaining million shares are the publicly traded float the other senior officers of the company are luke huybrechts senior vice president of sales a colleague of mr kopstein from itt and kenneth harber vice president of finance financials occ has operated profitably since its inception achieving record sales and earnings in the fiscal year ending october of million in net income or per share on sales of million we are estimating earnings of per share on sales of million for and per share on sales of million for the business is seasonal to a degree because weather in the winter can delay the installation of outdoor cable thus occ s business tends to be stronger in the second half of the year compared to the first half in the current year second quarter sales were impacted by bad weather in europe which had the worst winter weather in memory and a general softness in telecommunications related spending in the major european economies we expect sales to rebound strongly in the third and fourth quarters and to continue a seasonal pattern in the balance sheet is clean cash was reduced in the first half of fy to thousand because of the company s investment in an expansion of the existing plant with less than million of capital expenditures planned we expect cash to be rebuilt to over million in accounts receivable were days sales at the end of the second quarter and inventory turns were times valuation currently selling at times october estimated earnings the stock is not inexpensive at however it is selling near the low end of its historic p e range

find attached some of our recent press releases for information purposes on a more serious note i have not responded in quite a while on the short interest in occf as reported in several earlier press releases the few large funds that control most of the short interest continue to manipulate the stock price it is the value of your stock that they are playing with presently they have sold shares that they do not own depressing significantly the value of your shares remember short interest selling means that someone has borrowed your shares without your knowledge then sold them without your knowledge and is hoping to buy them back cheap and then return them to your account several stock brokers have suggested that the only way that we can drive the short interest manipulators out of occf is to have all shareholders request their shares back in certificate form presently million shares are at brokerage firms in street name and shares are in the original stock certificates if your occf

certificate form we shall monitor the process and send out additional newsletters approximately every two weeks so that you can stay informed with how many shares are in certificates versus in street name at stock broker offices as the number of shares in street name gradually declines the short interest manipulators will be forced to buy back that shares talk to your friends at home or work and let them watch and see what happens when shareholders take the initiative to drive these underhanded manipulators out of occf this process might take a little while to complete so be patient inform others and wait for the next update for your information here is an approximate background on when at what price range and how much stock the short interest manipulators have sold to depress the value in occf date number of shares sold sold short price range june to august to september to march to april to at what price would you be willing to sell your shares back to these short interest manipulators a good question that only you can answer remember it is like you loaning someone a stick to beat you up with and then asking yourself what happened the battle has just begun and with the

proud to be ranked in the hot growth companies chart that follows business week magazine may they re smart they re agile and they re piling up earnings meet the stars of the small cap set gradall industries inc may not fit your idea of a typical hot growth company for starters the new philadelphia ohio company was founded more than years ago and while many small cap wonders soar by riding the latest high tech wave gradall sells giant earthmovers and other equipment used in highway construction and on building sites in the early s gradall was well on its way to becoming just another rust belt relic spun off from alliedsignal inc in a leveraged buyout gradall had withered as a result of meager investment in new products and intense competition from the japanese cut profits when a band of former international harvester co executives took over in they named ex harvester manufacturing executive barry phillips president he improved the quality of gradall s existing machines and began pumping millions into new product development the opportunity was always here says phillips who became ceo in somebody just had to work hard enough to make it happen the hard work has certainly paid off earnings at gradall have skyrocketed an average of annually to million over the past three years while return on capital has averaged a stunning and steady sales growth has topped annually to hit million the dynamic mix of fast growth and red hot profits was enough to earn gradall the no spot on business week s list of the fastest growing small companies that combination of drive ingenuity and agility marks all the companies on business week s hot growth list it also keeps them charging ahead faster than much bigger rivals sure many giants of corporate america continue to boast impressive gains but these tiny dynamos still put them to shame for the past three years the companies saw average annual sales growth of vs for the standard poor s industrial index earnings grew vs for the s p while return on capital hit vs nice niches unlike gradall many of these supercharged superstars are cashing in on the high tech revolution software computer and telecom companies alone hogged spots any company that helps you use information and knowledge efficiently will be hot says thomas l doorley iii senior partner at boston based consultants braxton associates which develops growth strategies that includes no yurie systems inc which sells equipment that allows for the speedy transmission of video voice and data over satellite and phone links vitech america inc no manufactures pcs in the north brazilian town of ilheus selling many direct to local buyers and i technologies no makes prepackaged software that aids supply chain management other small companies are capitalizing

their entrepreneurial instincts firearms training systems no provides systems for use by the military and law enforcement agencies that simulate battlefield action or dangerous street arrests and apex pc solutions inc no makes cabinets that help network managers organize their computers still buyer beware although many thrived operationally last year small companies including many hot growth stars saw their shares hammered growth stocks slid deeply last summer tech shares in particular nosedived as wall street worried about rich valuations and the impact of a slowing economy says john w ballen portfolio manager of mfs emerging growth fund was a disaster if you focused on small growth companies to cut risks investors poured money into large companies which were generating surprisingly strong earnings the combination has made blue chip stocks a better investment than small caps and given small cap investors a jolting roller coaster ride it wasn t until january that the russell small cap index made up for its summer losses then it promptly plunged again in february when interest rates rose altogether the s p has rung up a gain over the past months while the russell is up just even many hot growth companies whose sales and earnings sparkled lagged stocks on this year s list traded at an average of of their week highs while the s p is near its week high the small cap correction also put the brakes on the once sizzling market for ipos according to s p billion was raised last year in the ipo market well above s billion but the pace has fallen off with only billion raised through april but so far venture capitalists haven t fled last year a record billion in venture funding was raised despite the disastrous some believe small caps may rebound we ve already felt the bulk of the pain says jack h laporte manager of t rowe price s new horizons fund a capital gains tax cut looks likely which could give growth stocks a boost if the u s dollar remains strong earnings at larger companies could be hit small fry are generally less affected by exchange rates and should the u s economy slow growth stocks may regain wall street s favor of course even if the market picks up there s always the risk of a fall for these dynamos page some may stumble trying keep up the growth while others may remain too tied to one trendy product and for investors there s the added risk of picking highfliers while wall street shuns such stocks but for those able to ford these difficult streams potential rewards are high as well by amy barrett in washington the tops in sales and sales

basic.materials.sector	date thu nov gmt server apache content type text html content length last modified sun sep gmt optical cable corporation equities magazine july august equities magazine america s fastest growing companies optical cable corporation is proud to be of the fastest growing nasdaq companies listed in the july august issue of equities magazine it s one thing to buy growth an acquisition here a merger there and poof you re the head of a fast growing firm judging from the top line but it s the bottom line that counts that is why equities measures profits when ranking the fastest growing companies in the country the good managements of the companies on the following tables have proven they can manage growth be it external or internal without sidetracking the operation or miring it in more debt than it can comfortably accommodate we ve ranked these companies based on five year earnings per share growth the initial computer screen done by los angeles based william o neil and company publisher of investors business daily permits one down month period in earnings per share as long as it isn t the latest months this avoids penalizing those who increased total profits but may have floated additional shares to finance growth or stumbled for a quarter or two however the growth screen excludes companies with losses in any of the past five years this criteria yielded a record number of companies with five year average earnings growth of a benchmark we use to identify managements with a superior long term performance in a time when many financial analysts and experts agree that the u s stock market is due for a correction it is comforting to see the accelerating number of public companies with solid earnings growth over the last four years the number of companies from the new york stock exchange making the grade skyrocketed to from a mere in thirty eight companies passed the mark from the american stock exchange up from only in the nasdaq stock market had the most fast growers with an impressive rise from in to today not suprisingly the technology sector was behind much of nasdaq s explosive growth claiming of its top twenty one of the top were computer hardware and software firms and peripheral manufactures shattering any doubt growth the electronic age is beginning to slow its furious pace included were established giants still growing such as microsoft intel oracle cisco and maxim joined by this year s number one performer cdw computer centers and relative newcomers but old equities favorites such as apac american business products checkpoint datastream systems express scripts jack henry associates sbs technologies sos staffing timberline valmont industries and ultratech stepper also making a strong showing from nasdaq were medical firms including steris corp serologicals corp oxford health plans jones medical mentor and medcath inc nasdaq was also a good place to find fast growing banks from spots like cape cod with achieving more than earnings per share growth while only nine banks made the list from the big board one of those imperial bancorp finished first with a five year earnings per share growth rate followed by chase s naturally blue chips like dow and xerox are there also providing real momentum for the nyse were insurance and finance firms including aflac contifinancial corp hcc insurance markel sierra health and titan also doing their share were oil and gas companies finishing four in the top varco suncor energy lomak petroleum and key production inc mutual fund managers t rowe price and franklin templeton and brokers morgan stanley and discounters like charles schwab and quick reilly rode the bull in the past equities has featured favorable stores on over of these champion growers often we were the first nationally or positive when short sellers predicted doom for stars like alcide gentex actrade apogee claire s stores cuc eagle usa airfreight parametrics poe pre paid legal services supreme international and total tel usa like the law of gravity what goes up must eventually come down as a company s base grows larger and larger the annual growth rate gets smaller and smaller however many companies are able to manage their growing bases and still stay on a respectable growth track these are our phenomenal growers and the list repeaters from our august issue are in bold throughout the tables and remember besides growth looks great in a table there is consistency and the earnings stability growth factor is listed for each company calculated by o neil this indicates standard deviation of the variability around the trend line fitted through three to five years of earnings history it indicates how much earnings varied over the five years of our screen the lower the stability factor the more stable and smooth earnings growth was for example a stability factor of five means two thirds of all month earnings fall within a band around the trend line small firms with very high growth rates will come back down to earth but the rapid climb in between can be profitable playing the momentum investing game can have its drawbacks if you only react to earnings releases and estimate shortfalls the long term growth should never be ignored for short term stock gains or you won t be seeing big profits when the company becomes a blue chip optical cable

basic.materials.sector	date thu nov gmt server apache content type text html content length last modified thu jun gmt occ inc magazine june nasdaq symbol occf inc magazine june the hottest small company ipo s shunned by the street robert kopstein did the unthinkable he took his company public himself by robert a mamis in contrast to netscape communications much ballyhooed initial public offering in optical cable corp s ipo went virtually unnoticed by wall street optical cable s ipo resulted in a similar outcome a founding stockholder became a paper billionaire but in this case the th digit came and went so fast that its beneficiary an electrical engineer named robert kopstein had scant time to celebrate the next day the market took away what it had bestowed only the day before in spectacular fashion even by s stupefying standards until his company s april offering as occf on nasdaq kopstein the chief executive officer of optical cable had been the sole shareholder in the company a fiber optic cable manufacturer he d costarted with partners whom he later bought out in roanoke va in after selling newly issued shares he still retained of the company or million worth you might think that he d have been content with that achievement professionals expect a small company going public to sell more of itself than a mere generally they told kopstein closer to but kopstein s accomplishments didn t stop there seven weeks later to his and everyone else s astonishment the price of the stock soared to not adjusted for two splits a spectacular increment that pushed optical cable s market value past billion and kopstein s portion to billion by the close of the next day his net worth had retreated to million give or take after two two for one stock splits in may and june optical cable s stock settled back to around not adjusted for the splits and closed up for the year had all that drama unfolded under the banner of a prominent investment banker optical cable s ipo would doubtlessly have been hailed as the hottest of the year none of it did however the flotation was pulled off by a total novice kopstein himself and in virtually every review of that record year the then year old upstart was airbrushed out of existence when a stock gains in six weeks and splits twice in days it s usually a matter for investigation no such cloud hung over optical cable which came to market boasting a history of steady growth and legitimate net sales of million what s more the company reported net income of million million more than netscape if kopstein had committed any offense it was snubbing the good old boys his deal didn t employ the services of the investment banking crowd but not for lack of trying kopstein s initial initial public offering urge had struck in when his company s net sales were at million he intended to raise only million enough to expand the factory facilities hire outside salespeople pay down some debt and set aside stock for employee options so starting with san francisco s montgomery securities which he says advised him to wait until the company was bigger he called on prominent investment bankers who specialized in technology people told me that if you re in high tech be sure to get a company that has good research people who can tell the story of what you re really about says kopstein the half a dozen underwriters with whom he met over the years including those from such prominent houses as robinson humphrey and dean witter couldn t be bothered one demurred on the grounds that while its researchers were familiar with most things electronic they knew nothing about optical fiber another was simply too busy a third felt the deal was too trifling to bother with for anyone looking to do a small offering kopstein says recalling his disillusionment after the last underwriter rodman renshaw in new york city turned him down there was scant interest in the fall of kopstein at last persuaded an investment banker unterberg harris of new york city to handle the proposed underwriting of million shares of optical cable the firm printed up preliminary offering prospectuses showing itself as the lead underwriter on the left side of the cover as protocol dictates and another investment banker piper jaffray in minneapolis as a coparticipant on the right unterberg harris prepped kopstein for personal appearances on the dog and pony circuit but before the road show ended kopstein pulled the plug the price unterberg harris was about to settle for was disappointingly below the a share kopstein thought his company was worth i didn t realize that when there are two names on a prospectus there s a big difference in who s responsible for what he says of the setup i thought i d hired a team of horses to pull us to the finish line but he says the job just didn t get done through a contact he offered the now dormant deal to a g edwards and sons inc in st louis its head of corporate finance spencer burke said he d have to wait at least six months before the financial community would again pay attention to the company but he added you re too strong minded a man to be held back by what people think why not do it yourself for a practical answer kopstein consulted his company s lawyers mcguire woods battle boothe in richmond va and counsel did everything it could to dissuade me he says the lawyers advised that on occasion regional banks conducted their own small best efforts offerings over an extended period of time but that what kopstein had proposed was unheard of i don t want to wait six months kopstein insisted i want to do it quickly and i want to do it right for a neophyte financier those imperatives are at odds i didn t realize there were so many barriers put there to keep this type of offering from happening he says luckily two major barriers had already been cleared registering the offering statement with the securities and exchange commission and preparing the instrument that exhaustively describes the deal to potential buyers kopstein simply adapted the terms of the earlier red herring so called for the patches of red ink that identify the publication as being preliminary and subject to change normally the placement of all offered shares would be guaranteed by underwriters optical cable s self underwriting was an arrangement in which whatever number of shares the public bought would constitute the flotation and the receipts from them less expenses from the ipo would flow entirely to the company kopstein s first task was to get as many prospectuses as possible into the hands of as many prospective buyers as possible he opened a site on the internet posting his intentions and then he booked tombstone ads stark announcements that by sec edict invite a reader only to send for a descriptive prospectus in major newspapers in the states that allowed it at any rate in some states those descriptions didn t meet local blue sky laws the often antiquated statutes so named because they refer to schemes that are worth no more than a patch of blue sky that define how securities can be offered to an innocent populace to qualify in california for example he would have had to change his company s bylaws and reprint the prospectuses accordingly in some instances kopstein chose not to bother he never did get registered in california but just in case he distributed prospectuses to his roanoke neighbors and then assigned a cadre of employees to man the phones like a bunch of telemarketers over four weeks they booked orders for shares from some buyers kopstein wanted to keep trying and sell another half a million shares but the earlier buyers were getting restless they wanted the stock to start trading in the open market easier said than done kopstein discovered lacking underwriters optical cable also lacked market makers for a company s stock to qualify for a national market listing on nasdaq not only must that stock meet certain performance minimums see doc no incmagazine archives so you want to go public but the company also must have two third party dealers to handle outside orders to buy and sell its shares for most of the ipo universe a company s underwriters ipso facto become its market makers as well as its research analysts in the financial community it so happened that at this time david adam a former wall streeter turned financial freelancer spotted a tombstone ad and phoned in to ask if there was anything he could help out with kopstein didn t hesitate sure he said find me a couple of market makers adam called around to his buddies but they wouldn t touch kopstein they saw him as a guy trying to out finesse wall street those fellows get nice fees and warrants and stock options and green shoes but bob would have none of it everybody said in effect we don t go down there and tell him how to make cable it took more than calls for adam to unearth two firms willing to handle optical cable s stock underwriters rely on mutual funds and other institutional investors to commit to the lion s share of an issue and establish its final price but as a peddler of unknown merit selling a comparatively scant number of shares in a business unfamiliar to institutional investors kopstein reached just one such buyer newby co a rockville md investment firm which subscribed to shares for some retirement fund clients kopstein blames the absence of other institutional interest on people s unfamiliarity with his unusual line of business what made it difficult for us where it wouldn t have been for others is that there was no other company doing the same type of thing when all you have to do is pull up a set of comparable figures and see where you fit in selling yourself is easier but if institutions don t have a peg by which to judge whether you re better or worse than other companies they sit back to see how the market receives the offering he says kopstein tagged optical cable shares at to yield a modest for a fast growth technology issue price to earnings ratio of i wanted to get a reasonable amount of shares out there and see how the market accepted the price he says when we needed more money in the future we could go back out at whatever price the market thought the stock ought to be valued the market was even more positive about the stock than kopstein was the offering price more than doubled within five weeks passing on may a week after that it was in six days more maybe buyers from california the befuddled kopstein conjectured were sending in orders for stock they weren t allowed to buy on the offering as the share price inexplicably jumped some a day kopstein got a call not from the sec but from cnbc the financial news cable network invited him on the air on may just after a m greenhorn kopstein got skewered by the squawk box the interviewers kept shooting arrows they wanted to know more about what the stock was doing than what the company was doing kopstein guilelessly confessed ignorance to the machinations of the stock market and seized the moment to educate millions of viewers about optical cable the job at which he insists the underwriters he d hired had failed the billionaire for a day was astounded by the response right after i got off the air the stock went through the roof people called and e mailed saying that the company of a ceo who could stand up like that while they tried to fill him full of holes that company was going to have a fantastic future despite the exhilarating ride kopstein admits he wouldn t take the solo route again toting up the start at a m days he devoted to the ipo in addition to running the company he says that leaving out the middlemen cost at least as much as if i d used an underwriter to do the deal nonetheless acknowledges a g edwards s burke what he did is incredible for most ceos of most companies it would be too much of a challenge but not impossible if you have a

providing significant savings in electrical costs in addition when combined with the company s light sources unlike neon the company s products are capable of changing color the company currently sells side glow tm cables in four diameters designed to meet customer needs and specifications additionally during the fourth quarter the company introduced a line of end glow tm cables designed for underwater spot lighting and interior task down lighting to date the company s side glow tm and end glow tm cables have been used in major installations worldwide additionally as a result of the expansion of the company s international distribution network and other distribution channels in various markets the company s products have been introduced to the mainstream lighting market the company also filed for patent cooperation treaty protection of its side glow tm fiber optic cables in over foreign countries during in december the company completed the acquisition of custom for super vision fiber optic cabling and extrusion equipment which will be utilized by the company to manufacture its side glow tm and end glow tm cables in house the company believes that the vertical integration of processes formerly performed by subcontractors will allow the company to achieve significant cost reductions in this product line during side glow tm and end glow tm cable products accounted for approximately of the company s total revenues the company believes that this product area offers the largest growth potential and therefore the company intends to devote the majority of its engineering and sales and marketing efforts to expand this area of its business and the related light source product line described below light sources the company manufactures and markets a proprietary line of internally manufactured light sources each designed for specialized applications during the company expanded its light source product offerings from its original two sv series metal halide sources to five metal halide and halogen light sources targeted to meet specific market needs each model is produced to meet a variety of voltage needs and indoor or outdoor uses the company also produces a line of light source controllers which allow multiple light sources to be sequenced in simple or complex links to simulate an array of special lighting effects in addition to the introduction of its proprietary light source line the company perfected a new method of coupling fiber optic cables to its light sources this fiber head system allows for a much simpler installation of fiber optic cables than has ever been possible with competing fiber optic systems the company has a patent pending on this system and believes the system will afford a significant competitive advantage over existing market systems although several of these light source products were only on the market for a short period of time during sales of the company s light sources represented approximately of the company s total revenue during the company s light source products are complementary to the company s side glow tm and end glow tm fiber optic cables and the company plans to devote significant resources to continue development of these products and markets endpoint signs and displays the company manufactures endpoint fiber optic signs and custom displays for advertising signage and point of purchase displays fiber optic strands are used with customized light sources to create a virtually limitless combination of designs patterns and effects the company has utilized this technology to create custom designs for clients such as planet hollywood walt disney world and coca cola the company entered into a contract in the fourth quarter of to produce what is believed to be the world s largest fiber optic sign which is scheduled to be completed in march while these types of displays are produced on a custom only basis the company believes this type of contract will enhance the visibility of fiber optics in the advertising and sign market and provide a marketing platform for the company s standard fiber optic products the company utilizes the same technology used in large scale custom displays in the manufacture of its point of purchase displays point of purchase signs are utilized by retailers and advertisers in the promotion of their products and services the company has produced point of purchase signs for many fortune clients during endpoint signs and displays accounted for approximately of the company s total revenues sales and marketing the company s products are utilized in a wide variety of markets and applications including architectural lighting signage advertising swimming pool and spa lighting tasklighting i e conference room down lighting and specialty theme lighting the company previously relied on internally generated sales efforts for the majority of revenues during the company continued development of its distribution channels in the aforementioned markets and expended significant resources to acquire educate and train international distributors domestic lighting agents pool lighting contractors and to promote the company s products to major sign manufacturers consequently the majority of revenues were derived through these distribution channels the company will also continue to directly market custom endpoint displays and signs as a method of increasing revenues and to expand overall exposure to fiber optic lighting technology manufacturing suppliers and quality control the fiber optic strands used in the company s endpoint signs and displays as well as the production of its side glow tm and end glow tm cables are purchased exclusively from a japanese company in october the company entered into a contract for the design and purchase of customized cabling and extrusion equipment in order to produce its side glow tm and end glow tm cables the equipment became operational in december the company believes the equipment may reduce the manufacturing costs of its side glow tm and end glow tm cables and therefore allow the company to offer its products to the market at prices competitive with neon lighting the company maintains outside manufacturing capabilities for these products in the event additional capacity is required the company manufactures the light sources and control systems used with its side glow tm and end glow tm cables and endpoint displays in its facility in orlando florida the designs of the light sources are considered proprietary and the company has a u s patent application pending with respect to this design all endpoint displays are manufactured directly by the company based on the clients specifications or designed jointly with the company s highly experienced personnel the company believes its ability to offer a full range of products and design engineering and support services are unique in the market place and are important in the future prospects for growth the company s strategy is to continue to strive for lower manufacturing costs and reduce its dependence on outside suppliers by expanding its manufacturing capabilities and engineering its products around off the shelf components combined in proprietary designs the company continues to perform research and development to further lower the cost of production of all existing products the company also plans to develop additional products and identify new markets and distribution channels these efforts resulted in the introduction of the company s swimming pool and spa line in the fourth quarter of these products are designed to be price competitive with traditional under water lighting products while offering the advantages of voltage free light and color changing in the water the company also introduced a line of fiber optic landscape feature and accent lights for the pool and architectural lighting markets the company will continue to purchase the fiber optic strands from its sole source japanese supplier while the company believes alternative sources for fiber optics are available to enable it to produce its endpoint signs and displays the side glow tm and end glow tm cables requires fiber optic material of a higher quality than the company believes is currently available elsewhere accordingly the loss of this supplier or delays in obtaining shipments would have a material adverse affect on the company s operations until such time if ever as an alternative supplier could be found which could provide the quality level in the amounts the company requires one possible supplier has been identified or the company could implement its own production capabilities the company has implemented a quality control qc system based on total quality models and joined a florida round table consortium of companies working towards certification of their qc systems under is the company believes certification is important in the achievement of a quality conscious manufacturing environment and may be critical in further expansion of overseas market acceptance while their can be no assurance that the company will achieve certification the company believes the implementation of this integrated qc system could have a positive impact on the quality of its products and services research and product development the company s engineering research and product development staff is responsible for the design of standard and custom products developed to meet specific market needs identified by the company and requested by its customers the company considers its ability to constantly improve existing products rapidly introduce new products to fill identified needs and design solutions for custom applications to be critical to the growth of the company the company believes this responsiveness to the market to be an important differentiating factor and will continue to seek rapid response to market trends during the company spent approximately on engineering and product development activities the company believes its success will depend in large part on its ability to continue to improve and enhance its existing products for example by increasing the level of brightness of its side glow tm and end glow tm cables increasing the temperature resistance of its fiber optic products and extending the life of the lamp in its light source and to develop new products and applications for its technologies competition the company currently faces competition from both traditional lighting technologies such as neon and florescent lighting and from competitors specifically engaged in fiber optic lighting traditional lighting technologies have the advantage of a long history of market acceptance and familiarity as compared to the company s products the company is actively seeking to educate its target markets as to the advantages of fiber optic lighting systems the company believes that achievement of this objective is critical to the company s future the company must also compete with traditional lighting on the issues of maintenance costs safety issues energy usage price and brightness the company believes its products can effectively compete against traditional lighting in the areas of maintenance safety and energy consumption the company s lighting systems offer the advantage of centralized light source maintenance for lamp replacement this feature is superior to other lighting systems such as neon which require maintenance through out the lighting system additionally the company s side glow tm and end glow tm cables are virtually maintenance and breakage free as opposed to neon and other comparable lighting products which experience high field and in shipment breakage rates this reduced breakage also favorably compares in the area of safety further the company s products result in a voltage free light which is particularly beneficial in wet and under water applications where risk of shock from electricity in the lighted path is an issue the company s products also eliminate the majority of heat and radiation at the light output which can be advantageous in applications where these factors may not be desirable such as task lighting and display case lighting the company s products may not favorably compete with traditional lighting on the basis of price for smaller lighting systems and in particular with neon systems in smaller scale applications which comprise a large portion of the available market additionally fiber optic lighting systems do not equal neon brightness in a cost effective manner for many applications in applications calling for maximum brightness and competitive cost the company s products may not be able to compete effectively with traditional lighting products competitors in the traditional lighting markets include such companies as general electric philips cooper industries american products and other large companies with greater financial resources than those possessed by the company additionally the company s products compete with many local and regional neon manufacturers and installers with established market presence the company currently faces competition from a defined number of companies directly involved in the field of fiber optic lighting addressed by the company s side glow tm and end glow tm cables and light source products these companies utilize a similar technology to that used by the company and compete generally on the basis of price and quality the company believes it has the lowest price structure of all current competitors in this industry and may compete favorably in markets where price is the central issue the company s quality control system will also allow the company to compete on the basis of quality of product and services delivered there can be no assurance however that the current competitors directly involved in this industry will not develop processes or technology which will allow them to decrease their costs and consequently erode the company s price advantage additionally there can be no assurance that a large conventional lighting company will not enter the market and utilize its resources to capture significant market share and adversely affect the company s operating results the company s endpoint signs and displays compete with numerous smaller companies utilizing the same or similar technologies in the area of custom displays and signs the company s expertise in the field and history of major installations may allow the company to achieve a position as the leader in this field the company s smaller point of purchase signs compete directly on a price basis with these smaller companies including several foreign competitors whose lower labor costs allow them to achieve a price advantage over the company s products these point of purchase products also compete to some extent with customary signage which is considerably less expensive than fiber optic products the company believes that the quality of its products is equal to or superior to those offered by its competitors and that its products offer unique advantages over customary signage such as color changing aesthetically pleasing special effects and motion patents and proprietary rights the company considers its technology and procedures proprietary and relies primarily on patent and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect its technology and innovations employees and commissioned salespersons of the company as well

aspects of the company s products or obtain information that the company regards as proprietary furthermore there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop products similar to those sold by the company the company has been issued a united states patent relating to the reflective center core used in the process of manufacturing its side glow tm cables and has filed for patent cooperation treaty protection of this patent overseas additionally the company has acquired a united states patent related to the method of manufacture of a fiber optic image magnification device while there is no guarantee that this patent can be developed into a commercially viable product the company believes that expansion of the applications for its fiber optic technologies are important to the possible achievement of future growth objectives the company has a third patent pending related to its light source technology and a device for connecting fiber optic cables to the light source the company will continue to seek patent protection where appropriate for future developments improvements and enhancements to its technology there can be no assurance however that the company s patent or patents which may be issued in the future will provide the company with sufficient protection in the case of an infringement of its technology or that others will not independently develop technology comparable or superior to the company s although the company believes that the products sold by it do not and will not infringe upon the patents or violate the proprietary rights of others it is possible that such infringement or violation has occurred or may occur in the event that products sold by the company are deemed to infringe upon the patents or proprietary rights of others the company could be required to modify its products or obtain a license for the manufacture and or sale of such products the company has obtained approval for a registered trademark for the

to these fees further revenues from the license if any are dependent on sales of the licensed product by the distributor which management cannot predict the gross margin increased from in to in the gross margin experience was favorably impacted by the higher relative sales mix of side glow tm and end glow tm fiber optic cables and related light source products as well as custom fiber optic endpoint displays these products have higher margins than the point of purchase signage products the gross margin contained a higher relative mix of point of purchase signage the company continues research into new methods of manufacturing point of purchase products additionally the aforementioned licensing agreement may also reduce costs of this product due to lower offshore labor costs however management is unable to determine the extent to which if any these proposed manufacturing methods or the licensing agreement may reduce costs if at all during december the company received delivery of its custom for super vision fiber optic cabling and extrusion equipment the equipment is utilized in the manufacture of the company s side glow tm and end glow tm fiber optic cables and may reduce the manufacturing costs of these products due to the integration of processes formerly performed by subcontractors additionally the company is conducting research into the use of the same

energy.sector	date thu nov gmt server ncsa last modified wed oct gmt content type text html content length a brave new world coal in a deregulated u s power market tayeb tahir presentation coaltrans istanbul turkey a brave new world coal in a deregulated u s power market good morning i have been invited here today to tell you about the effects of electric industry deregulation in the u s on the coal industry that s a little bit like being asked to tell you about the expected effects of a hurricane that s approaching a shoreline we can t predict exactly what will happen or which trees or houses will remain standing but we have a pretty good idea that nothing will be the same when it s all over it is clear that deregulation will have a profound impact on the way electric power is generated transmitted bought and sold in the united states it s also clear that as a result of these changes the coal industry itself will undergo massive changes that parallel the shifts in natural gas markets in the s and electric power markets of just a few years ago nothing less than a whole new world a brave new world of coal if you will is being formed as we speak in this brave new world those who can reshape and reposition themselves to take advantage of the new structures and dynamics will see increased opportunities those who remain static are likely to find themselves on the sidelines i like to think that companies like my own are in the former group and i will be telling you a little about how we are positioning ourselves for this new world as i said it s difficult to predict precisely what the industry will look like in a few years after the hurricane has subsided somewhat but you can be sure that we are doing our best to anticipate those changes and how they will impact our future our educated guesses are informed to a great extent by our observations of the recent upheavals and outcomes in the natural gas markets and in the electric power markets and today i will be focusing on changes in three key areas that i think are of interest to all of us first is coal s increasing importance in a deregulated market as the principal fuel for electricity coal will see expanded opportunities in both physical and financial markets second are structural changes in the energy industry deregulation is accelerating ongoing structural changes in both electric utilities and coal companies and third is the transformation of coal into a commodity coal will soon be bought and sold much as natural gas and oil are as commodities that can be priced and hedged in the financial markets this is a huge departure from the long term fixed price contracts of the past first let s look at coal s increasing importance coal is the least expensive fuel for generating electricity it is also already the principal fuel for electricity coal currently generates about percent of the electricity used in the u s we think it is safe to expect that as electric utilities rise to the challenge of competition they will be seeking more efficient and lower cost power generation we think it is also safe to expect that coal will become even more preferred in this scenario playing an increasingly important role in a deregulated market this increasing importance is being driven by several forces first coal companies are extending their value chains to encompass a much broader spectrum of energy activities in the past coal companies focused on core mining activities such as extraction and transportation today s companies are looking to extract more than coal we need to extract value all along the energy supply chain so you re likely to see coal companies that have a much broader reach all along the energy value chain from the fuel source to the customer we are essentially vertically integrating our businesses so that we can protect and expand our interests all along the value chain at zeigler and enerz for example we re long on coal but we are extending our reach to leverage our existing fuel relationships i ll talk more about exactly what we re doing in just a few moments going back to our list of factors that are driving coal s increasing importance i think it s important to acknowledge the increasing ability of power marketers to access information in the past it was difficult for power marketers to access the information needed to support fluctuating coal prices but that information is becoming increasingly accessible which is making it much easier to consummate coal deals at a rapid pace we re not looking at minute by minute prices just yet but even monthly fluctuations seem like the speed of light compared to the old long term pricing third utilities are linking their power generating and fuel procurement functions which can only increase their focus on coal as a low cost generation fuel until recently the bulk power marketing arms of most utilities were disconnected from their fuel procurement functions deregulation or should i say competition has helped them see the advantages of linking these functions they now see the relationship between the cost of fuel procurement and how they generate revenue within and outside their franchise areas with the fuel source more closely factored into that equation coal has obvious advantages fourth contract terms are getting shorter in the past it was not unusual to see even to year contracts today there s a lot more spot coal being traded and the new demands of deregulation will mean much shorter terms fifth innovative delivery mechanisms such as coal tolling and coal by wire are growing coal tolling allows utilities to lease their excess capacity to a third party who burns fuel and sells the generated power to whoever wants to buy it and coal by wire is just what it sounds like it s a lot cheaper to burn the coal near the mine and transmit that power to a far off utility customer than to transport the coal to that far off customer in the first place this is one of the creative delivery mechanisms we re seeing and i m sure there will be more and sixth and finally financial markets are developing that will revolutionize the way coal is bought and sold the new york mercantile exchange or nymex is preparing for coal to be traded as a commodity so it can be priced and hedged in the marketplace nymex has already started the process to launch a coal futures contract that will lead to real time pricing of coal by early next year as you might imagine the availability of this financial market will act as a powerful facilitator in the convergence of gas power and coal trading what this means to a company like ours is that we can backstop our financial trades with the commodity itself from our own mines we can apply our power trading skills directly to coal trading all of these forces are combining in a synergistic manner to increase coal s importance as a power generating fuel and as you might imagine they are also helping to fuel major structural changes in the coal and electric power industries we are already witnessing a massive reshaping of industry structures both in the coal arena and in electric utilities the energy policy act of resulted in a new opportunity allowing the sale of electric power directly to wholesale customers this is resulting in a reshuffling of the marketplace major players are dismantling and reassembling themselves in more efficient and creative ways that will position them for the new market dynamics a key result of this restructuring is that larger players are commanding an increasing market share while smaller players are fighting for a smaller piece in niche markets electric utilities are also redefining themselves as they look for ways to serve not a group of captive customers but a competitive marketplace made up of customers who will soon have the power to choose where they purchase electricity mergers acquisitions and restructurings are rampant zeigler coal holding company is positioning itself for this new world through many changes including the formation of enerz corporation with enerz zeigler has created a virtual utility a mechanism that will make it possible to buy and sell electric power and its underlying fuels and also to purchase rights to assets owned by other companies so that we can assemble the best of the deregulated world some of these purchases may be linked to hard assets such as coal inventories others may be tied to contractual rights to other generating plants or even to generating stations owned by zeigler the potential is limitless and we are looking at as many possibilities as we can expanding our operations all along the energy value chain the third and final area of change brought about by deregulation is the transformation of coal into a commodity indeed a transformation of electricity and all of the underlying fuels that generate electric power just as natural gas and oil have become commodities coal will be traded as a commodity with pricing fluctuating daily and even hourly and with coal prices tied much more closely to other fuels while coal is closely linked with electric power it will have more in common with the way natural gas and crude oil and refined products are traded this has many practical implications for how coal is inventoried and stored transported and used again we don t know exactly what the shoreline will look like when the hurricane is past but we expect it will look very different the result of all these changes is that coal trading will integrate with power and gas trading in a much more complex and sophisticated market deregulation will allow coal to substitute for other fuels as utilities look for low cost generation means and finally coal mining and coal fired generation assets will increase in value these assets will increase in value because they will operate in new deregulated structures please keep in mind that the value of the assets is determined by the type of people who own and run them those who can efficiently combine financial trading skills with the operation of the physical assets will not only thrive in the new marketplace but will also increase the value of these assets of course our own company fits this description what will this industry look like three years from now who will the winners and the losers be the answers to these questions are worth a great deal to those who can guess correctly we can find some parallels if we look at the massive changes in the natural gas markets in the s those who transformed themselves became key players in the industry while those who remained static are no longer around those who plan to succeed require not only significant financial resources but also a high tolerance for risk and a diversified portfolio of hard and soft assets in addition they need a cultural change in their organizations an attitude of irreverence for the status quo and the ability to maneuver in an ambiguous marketplace no one can anticipate precisely what this industry will look like over the next few years as various industry players look for the right answers innovative solutions will emerge one thing is certain those who can rise to the challenge of coal as a commodity business those who can both reduce cost and enhance value will have a prominent place in this brave new world

thaws during spring break up spring break up make previously frozen roads soft so heavy drilling and service rigs are prohibited from using many of the roads that connect to well sites as a result

shareholders several shareholders have expressed concern about the recent performance of our stock i would like to share my thoughts with you regarding that issue and give you an update on the company there is no question that the industrial fire at the wyoming plant in late december created a negative public perception even though the fire was totally unrelated to the technology or the k fuel processors the destruction of the oil storage tank and oil heater prevented the start up operations of the plant new equipment was immediately ordered and the fire damage reconstruction was completed in early july because their oil supply was not affected by the fire two of the four processors were operational during reconstruction as an added precaution thermo ecotek which owns of the plant conducted a routine inspection of the contractor s work prior to full operation the third party engineers discovered an error made by the construction contractor whereby the safety venting valves were under designed in the unlikely event that there was a rupture of any internal tubes the fix was to insert additional venting valves and install four surge tanks to contain any potential problem this will take an additional to weeks the additional costs of this project and any losses incurred are covered by the bonding companies this unfortunate oversight has further delayed operations however the safety of employees is a foremost concern we are also taking this opportunity to use the knowledge gained during the plant s initial operations to enhance its operation and efficiencies the bad news is that the market has eagerly awaited the full start up of the plant with subsequent test burns and is disappointed by the delays even though plant start up and operations is a thermo ecotek responsibility my team and i review daily the recovery engineering details both to obtain independent assessments and to help expedite tasks tck has accepted our assistance and remains positive about the k fuel technology based on the already completed runs that proved that the plant would produce a quality high btu k fuel while we are intensely pushing the responsible parties to get the gillette plant on line we are taking several measures to strengthen the company by maximizing the near term opportunities to generate positive cash flow and enhance shareholder value last month we successfully raised million in the european markets at quite favorable terms for our company the debentures carry a low coupon and are convertible at a later date at a significant premium to current market the company s challenge today is to put these funds to work to generate near term revenues additionally to prudently manage our resources and capitalize on our opportunities we have taken the following steps reduced overhead costs by approximately by cutting staff and administrative expenses and shifting other personnel and costs to our strategic partners thermo ecotek and kennecott commenced construction of a woodwaste to activated carbon plant these smaller facilities which can be built in a fraction of the time and cost required for a coal k fuel plant can be financed by kfx alone negotiating to increase our equity in the existing k fuel plant from to over and monetize the tax credits yielding kfx between million per year to aggressively working to close the million ton per year k fuel plant in indonesia final design has been determined completing tests and prepare financing structure for the turkish project continuing to develop large scale k fuel plants worldwide with kennecott through k fuel llc pursuing alternative investment opportunities stemming from our core technology and other synergistic projects with all of this said i have been receiving numerous phone calls asking why our stock price is so low there were two unrelated events one the result of a corporate merger and the other the pledging of stock to a bank as collateral that resulted in significant stock liquidation i believe these two large transactions together with impatient investors triggered other margin calls that continue to pressure the market it appears we are seeing the end of this clean up we received an additional vote of confidence from the just released in depth research report by bluestone capital with a long term buy recommendation i have invested millions of dollars in the technology over the past sixteen years it is my opinion that we are now in the best place in the company s history we know the process works we have found a huge international market for the product and we have adequate cash to see it all through even with all of the problems of building a one of a kind industry and the frustrations of constructing the first of its kind plant we are on target to achieve success thank you for your continued support and patience sincerely theodore venners chairman home who we are the process information questions

are presented in a variety of venues around the world in this space we ll put up a few sets of remarks on important issues that we believe may be of interest to the public recent executive speeches to sustain our current employment levels in a mature economy with percent gdp growth the u s must sell to those emerging markets that are enjoying growth levels two and three times faster than ours and as hard as it may be to accept in the most powerful economy in the world to do this in an increasingly competitive world we must continue to adapt faster we must compete smarter and we must act more boldly and with a broader vision make no mistake the world is watching but it is not waiting global realities remarks by chairman and ceo dave coulter pittsburgh pennsylvania may last year when i spoke to shareholders at the annual meeting for the first time i identified an overall goal i had set for the company i said then that we wanted to make bankamerica the best place to bank the best place to work and the best place to continue to invest there is one more thing that i think can help us to be the best you remarks at the annual meeting of shareholders by chairman dave coulter los angeles california may we all have a decision to make about the common good we can be bound by close horizons or we can behave like leaders we can demand of our representatives a sense of urgency in addressing the crisis in social security we can demand of our representatives a solution that is broad minded thorough and fair we can demand a return to values like personal accountability and responsibility and we can demand that demagoguery will not be tolerated the social security crisis a search for solutions excerpted remarks by chairman and ceo dave coulter palm springs california march you and i in this room may grasp the benefits of a global economy and free trade the fact is that across this country a good many people some thoughtful and some not so thoughtful simply think we re wrong they think that trade should be limited american jobs protected and domestic industries insulated the challenge is to convince ourselves and our colleagues to look beyond a short term win

ceo dave coulter seattle washington october as individuals we must move from an entitlement ethic to a savings ethic or what former commerce secretary pete peterson recently called a self endowment national ethic at present however we are acting like a nation in denial we personify the definition of insanity which is doing the same things over and over and expecting different results instead we must become a nation of savers once again living within our means and endowing our nation s future by creating the seed capital for investment our future is worth saving by chairman and ceo dave coulter los angeles california september our goals in essense are very simple we want bankamerica to be the best place to bank the best place to work and the best place to continue to invest to me that means keeping our focus on providing customers the services they want when where and how they want them it means recruiting the most talented people in the buisness motivating them to do their

industry is on the verge of a new era of growth and strength for four basic reasons first industry leaders are building strong new franchises that expand the scope and breadth of their business second

to provide exceptional superior service and attention to detail in this age when so many larger institutions through cost cutting or downsizing are moving away from premier service concierge to the other parts of the bank many of our business clients are also individuals with substantial private assets accommodating and expediting the special financial requirements of such individuals is one of

deposit accounts to maximize return on idle funds and customized market interest accounts with the cooperation of the pacific bank s investment officers we can provide long term investment options including both fdic insured and non insured products taxable and non taxable specifically designed to meet your needs this close attention to your asset management and credit needs allows you to maximize the efficiencies of your money trust services trust a confidence reposed in one person for the benefit of another respecting property which is held by the trustee black s law dictionary in mid the bank formed its trust division whose business is divided among individual pension and institutional accounts the establishment of the trust division was largely in response to a growing client demand that trust services be offered by the bank today the trust division provides highly personalized financial services to individual and corporate clients seeking an alternative to the trust relationship many have come to expect at other banks in addition to the bank s clients requesting that trust services be offered other factors prompted the bank to enter the trust business among them was a concern that because of several bank mergers and the pronouncement of major policy changes some san francisco trust departments had ceased to exist significantly increased the price of their services or become very impersonal or inconvenient in their client dealings it was felt therefore that in the bay area a need existed for a traditional trust department where the client beneficiary would be accorded a level of personal service and attention that previous generations have enjoyed and relied upon client philosophy in attempting to explain the trust business and just exactly what we do for beneficiaries we often over simplify our role by merely saying that we are in the people business it is our responsibility to serve a variety of individuals and institutions with distinctly different personalities and needs in accordance with written instructions which are found in wills trust documents and contracts over the past few decades we have witnessed with concern the shifting of priorities in many trust departments with the result that one can inquire whether trusts are being administered for the beneficiaries benefit or for the benefit of the bank trustee the pacific bank s commitment to the client beneficiary is to satisfy his or her personal and financial needs in a distinctly different manner investment management we believe that flexibility is the cornerstone of a successful relationship and nowhere is the element of flexibility more important than in the area of investment philosophy strategy and asset management as an example of flexibility the pacific bank has elected to offer its client beneficiaries a wide range of investment choices that is an investment portfolio can either be managed by the bank or the bank will be advised and assisted in the management of securities portfolios by independent investment counseling firms for fiduciary account relationships the bank at all times retains full fiduciary responsibility and does not delegate its investment authority should independent investment advisors assist in portfolio management decisions fiduciary accountability is maintained at every level of a trust relationship internal portfolio management the wealth management group in its capacity as a fiduciary or agent provides professional investment management services for both individual and corporate clients prior to any investment decision being implemented a client s specific needs are identified an investment objective is established investment guidelines are prescribed and the client s total understanding of the process is assured performance of these duties imputes to the pacific bank that reasonable care has been exercised and principles of loyalty have been adhered to by the bank investment portfolios are managed on a discretionary basis by a senior investment officer with extensive skills and experience echoing the bank s commitment to flexibility the investment officer may enter into a co management agreement with an independent investment advisor to aid in the more complex management of a particular securities portfolio the bank fully recognizes the need to be on the leading edge of the investment process in the constantly changing and ever demanding investment environs in addition to serving individual clients and fiduciary relationships the bank offers liquidity management for corporate clientele the proactive investment of liquid cash balances can benefit significantly a company s near term cash flow strategies and generate a premium return when compared to more passive investments a combination of well defined investment guidelines and strict compliance to them can produce rewarding results a broad range of investment alternatives are made available to our clientele to satisfy differing criteria in all circumstances an emphasis on investment quality and value is stressed the investment management team is disciplined to achieve reasonable expectations increasing a client s tolerance for risk can only be done by the client not the portfolio manager account administration earlier in this discussion we expressed the view that the basic business of a bank trustee is that of being in the people business having just concluded our explanation of managing investments we now turn our attention to the people side of our business the administration of trust accounts we believe we can best serve the trust beneficiary by focusing on those certain areas in which trust departments used to be recognized as having a high level of expertise the interpretation and implementation of trust documents the exercise of discretion and the safe custody of investable assets we believe that assigning one individual dedicated to the daily financial affairs of a relationship is both practical and desirable in order to enhance the quality of service we wish to provide the pacific bank s trust officer is that individual and is the primary beneficiary contact when dealing with our bank this officer is comparable in talent and knowledge to a seasoned department supervisor for consistency and assistance each trust officer has a qualified backup capable of assuming administrative account responsibilities who works closely with the trust officer during all phases of account administration securities custody and settlement by means of contractual relationships the pacific bank is a participant in the depository trust company one of two national depositories which holds most securities in book entry form and settles security transactions this participation improves our control over transactions and our service flexibility by enabling us to settle most security transactions through a national depository we have separate on line real time computer compatibility with the depository and are able to transmit or receive information and determine our asset positions at any time with respect to clients assets all depository eligible securities are held at the depository trust company in its nominee name those securities not eligible for depository safekeeping are maintained in our vault registered in our nominee name government securities eligible to be kept in book entry form are held at the federal reserve bank we settle securities transactions for accounts in our normal method which is to debit a client good funds and pay the broker on purchase settlement date as well as credit a client good funds on sale settlement date all trades are settled on the basis of delivery versus payment our policy on called bond items is to guarantee credit to the account of good funds on call date if we have actually received or should reasonably be expected to have received notice of the call accounts are credited with good funds on payable date for all income items reporting we provide monthly portfolio valuations and statements of transactions for each client s account showing the month s activity in chronological order in addition we can provide cash balance reporting as client needs dictate either orally or by hard copy or both conclusion reaching the vision the pacific bank has the long term strategic plan of becoming a valuable full service resource

investing for retirement care of elderly parents and planning for the education of children we are uniquely positioned to help people build protect and transfer their wealth the pacific bank is

quarter home about hri investor relations future pages talk to hri seek first to understand hri client partnerships beating the odds seek first to understand at hri recoveries are made every day based on the facts of an accident but when an hri examiner is faced with a case which demands a high level of technical expertise as well as their ability to understand the emotional aspects of a case a real difference is evident in the recovery in difficult negotiations hri examiners must remain sensitive to the clients injured members while at the same time protecting the recovery interests of the health care payor the resolution of a recent case epitomizes hri s willingness to work with the member and it established a benchmark to measure hri s commitment to serving its clients fully hri identified an accident file involving a teenage girl who was injured while riding as a passenger in her boyfriend s car following a complete investigation hri s examiner presented a consolidated statement of benefits to the liability carrier when there was no timely response the examiner personally contacted the liability carrier to request reimbursement in the course of the negotiations the examiner discovered the member s family had not filed a claim on the accident the attorney for the carrier explained that the member s religious beliefs prevented her from filing a personal injury claim against the boyfriend s policy seeking to further understand the situation the examiner asked the member to consider filing a claim for reimbursement of medical bills only one which would not pursue pain and suffering this approach would transfer the expense from the healthcare payor to the correct insurer the liability carrier when presented with this option the member s family agreed the health plan was entitled to reimbursement for the medical bills and a claim was initiated at this point it would be logical to assume that the case was resolved however the examiner s experience indicated that continued monitoring of this case was needed in periodic follow up with the liability carrier the examiner learned the member required future medical care relating to injuries received in the accident unfortunately the member s insurance was in jeopardy due to a pending loss of employment another solution was needed to provide the necessary medical care and to protect the health plan from future medical expenses the examiner recommended development of a settlement agreement to cover the member s anticipated medical care attorneys for hri s law firm sharps and associates the examiner and the client developed a settlement which provided the member with for future medical expenses and protected hri s client from the first in future bills should the injured party still be insured at the time of her surgery the settlement was accepted by all parties hri subsequently recovered more than from the boyfriend s remaining liability and medical benefits policies the hri examiner s dedicated efforts to understand the member s situation combined with their sensitivity to the member s relationship with the liable party proved to be beneficial for all the parties involved the hri emphasis on fully understanding each and every situation became the determining factor in the positive resolution of this case of the quarter hri client partnerships beating the odds outsourcing is often the best option in today s fast and cost conscious world of business experienced managers have learned that outsourcing is most successful when they maintain a sense of commitment to the outcome they know the best results are obtained when they provide their vendors thoughtful and timely input this case of the quarter demonstrates the importance of hri s client partnerships hri routinely searches for more than icd codes to identify accidents among its clients paid claims potential accidents may be rejected for many legitimate reasons but occasionally personal circumstances prevent an accident from qualifying for recovery in these cases hri s client contacts can provide valuable information this was the situation in a recent case hri s client contact was aware of a member who was a known hemophiliac and who had been involved in an accident on the job while processing the claims resulting from this member s accident the client discovered that the file was not reported on hri s monthly reports he called the hri recovery examiner to investigate the situation the examiner determined that hri had not received the claims data from the client due to the treatment being attributed to the member s hemophilia rather than an accident the client s early notice of its payment to the provider gave hri an edge in pursuing this recovery and the examiner fully applied hri s philosophy of planned persistence in working through the file her investigation uncovered the fact that the hospital had originally billed the state s workers compensation bureau but had been denied payment due to an error in the icd code she successfully encouraged the hospital to correct the error and resubmit the claims to the bureau the examiner then focused her efforts on obtaining payment from the bureau after repeated calls the case appeared headed to conclusion but the bureau made only a token payment the examiner went back to the drawing board to develop a strategic action plan her persistence in directly contacting the hospital administrator resulted in the hospital making a special payment request to the bureau four months and countless phone calls later hri recovered full payment of for its client on the member s accident claims hri s examiner summed it up the client s personal knowledge of the member s health circumstances helped set this recovery in motion and hri s philosophy of persistence really paid off this is a great example of how important the hri client partnership is to beating the odds home about hri investor relations

financial.sector	server netscape enterprise a date thu dec gmt accept ranges bytes last modified thu aug gmt content length content type text html willis corroon our history willis corroon group plc our history the willis corroon group has resulted from the combination of many firms the most significant being the mergers in of willis faber and stewart wrightson and in of willis faber and corroon black the origins of willis faber and corroon black are fairly well documented those of stewart wrightson less so the group s emergence can be seen to have occurred through a number of events which can be grouped into decades willis faber s origins lie in the early th century when great britain was the world s most powerful political and industrial nation the largest supplier of manufactured goods and enjoying unrivalled mercantial supremacy the city of london was the undisputed business capital of the world at that time three small insurance broking firms were established in the city family firms of three merchants born within a few years of each other henry dumas in george henry smith three of whose sons changed their surname to its latin equivalent faber in and henry willis in all three men became members of lloyd s henry willis co was established in initially at the baltic coffee house as insurance brokers and commission agents principally concerned with marine hull insurance the firm s name first appears in directories in dumas wylie was established years later in also as a lloyd s broker in the same decade we find the first evidence of an eventual part of the stewart wrightson group a partnership between galbraith and henderson in in the next decade in the group s german associate c wuppesahl co assekuranzmakler was established in bremen in the final decade of the century three vital links were forged firstly in henry willis co reached exclusive agreement with johnson higgins of new york for the placing of their marine business at lloyd s in willis then merged with faber brothers themselves founded in although george henry faber had been in business on his own account since the following year the firm was granted an agency for the tokio marine fire insurance company around the same time the firm was building its european contacts with agencies for the italia and the generali most prominent also in the firm of gibb macintyre founded in became james gibb son later to be part of bray gibb as was fletcher and welton a precursor firm of stewart smith although weltons later left this firm and re appeared as e j welton acquired by willis faber in the s in the first decade of the new century more is seen of the other major elements of the group r a corroon co inc was founded in new york by richard a corroon and matthews wrightson and arthur bray son two key stewart wrighton components in london the willis faber partners set up the cornhill insurance company and began expanding overseas with branches in montreal and hamburg the s were an important decade for willis faber interests were acquired in brodrick leitch kendall and henry l riseley on these firms were built the group s offices in liverpool birmingham bristol and cardiff the latter acquisition brought with it the british irish plate glass insurance company later re named sovereign an agency with the taisho now mitsui was established at the introduction of the tokio a treaty was placed for the new state insurance organisation of soviet russia gosstrakh the firm was appointed to represent the caja of chile and atlantic mutual of the usa in the london market and at the very end of willis faber company merged with dumas wylie to form willis faber dumas limited which started trading on january across the atlantic r a corroon by then concentrating on new york underwriting agency business as much as on brokerage set up corroon reynolds corporation to hold his various interests this company went public in the first publicly held broking business few events of note are recorded for the next few decades apart from the founding in in california by j h miller of a company specialising in surety construction bonds business which the following year became miller day and in miller day ames in this firm was re named miller ames in corroon reynolds sold its underwriting operations to concentrate on the development of broking years later merging with c r black jr corporation a prestigious new york firm to form corroon black corporation in turn in corroon black merged with miller ames during the s both stewart wrightson and willis faber obtained stock market quotations in willis moved into their award winning new building in ipswich followed years later by the move of the head office to ten trinity square during the same decade the growth through merger of corroon black gathered pace with particularly significant moves being the merger in with g l hodson the new york reinsurance intemediary and with synercon corporation of nashville tennessee in then the largest merger in us broking history and a move which nearly doubled corroon black s size stewart wrightson also grew in the s through amalgamations of bray gibb matthews wrightson and stewart smith and on into the s with arbuthnot insurance services and golding collins being acquired corroon black continued to complete a series of mergers through the late s and s willis faber s growth in the s was more organic then in it acquired the london reinsurance specialist carter wilkes fane and in the influential yorshire broker rattray daffern this set the stage for the creation of the present group recognising the need to reduce its dependence on others to produce revenue whether as reinsurance or as wholesale business to be placed in the london market the board of willis faber decided it was necessary to boost the group s direct broking operations at the same time access was required to the us market then the source of about half the world s insurance premiums the merger with stewart wrightson was the first step towards achieving these objectives creating in willis wrightson the uk s largest direct broker and providing through stewart smith and the us based insurance companies substantial operations in the usa at the same time this merger enhanced willis already pre eminent international reinsurance broking position years later the willis faber strategy was fulfilled with the merger with corroon black by then the th largest us broker which itself was seeking to spread outside the usa in order be able to offer a multinational service for the first years after the merger much remained to be done to complete the new group and its ability to operate globally in particular multinational servicing capability had to be established through continental europe a task accomplished by mid with the establishment of a network of subsidiary or associate operations throughout europe at the same time many other offices were opened around the world as the group built on its worldwide trading relationships to expand its direct account in the newly liberalising markets at the same time the us headquarters were moved from new york to nashville and a new regional organisation of the us direct broking operations undertaken by the beginning of these stages had been completed enabling the group to operate as one of the then half dozen broking organisations in the world providing a comprehensive global risk management and broking service to clients of all nationalities and in every sort of business the group s financial results in reflected the strain that this pace of investment had placed on the balance sheet at a time when its profitability particularly that of its us retail operations was under pressure from soft markets and acute competition as a result of a review of the group s strategy and operations determined cost reduction measures were undertaken and a sharper focus adopted for the onward development of the group ensuring that its global service and resources are targeted to those areas where it has or will swiftly gain competitive advantage during a re organisation of the group s operations was completed in which these were grouped into five business units north american retail uk retail us wholesale international and global specialities the latter comprising aerospace energy marine reinsurance and global non marine broking services simultaneous vigorous cost reduction measures mostly covered by a substantial provision made against the profits began to take effect leading to significant improvement in the group s profit and financial position by the end of the year towards the end of the year the group announced the appointment of john reeve as the first chairman to come from outside its own ranks under his leadership the group undertook a major re appraisal of strategy with the assistance of mckinsey co resulting from this the group re defined its fundamental objective as the creation of enhanced shareholder value as a professionally managed independent insurance broker and risk management consultant focusing on the optimum development of core businesses and seeking to exploit existing willis corroon group strengths this objective was to be pursued through three broad types of initiative building leadership positions in chosen market sectors that fit together as a coherent whole on a world wide basis to reinforce this approach individual business unit strategies were developed to achieve or maintain leadership positions with stretching targets established for improved performance raising profitability through implementation of a range of revenue and margin enhancement programmes and cost reduction and service improvement initiatives pursuing growth opportunities both in respect of existing core operations locally and geographically and in relation to new development opportunities while organic development was preferred acquisitions were to be pursued where organic growth is not feasible or is too slow subject to meeting criteria for cultural fit financial returns and manageable size concurrently a number of other initiatives were undertaken including the disposal of certain non core assets including certain businesses which in conjunction with a marked improvement in profitability throughout enabled the group to end that year with no net borrowings and a substantially stronger balance sheet the several elements of the new strategy were synthesised into a new vision for the group which was launched to all staff in late this envisages the evolution of the group building on its established advisory and transactional capabilities into a world wide knowledge based professional services organisation the vision in turn has led to the development of a comprehensive change programme which the group will continue to implement through and the group s immediate priority in mid was to establish a momentum of change and improvement in existing core businesses and to reinforce leadership positions in chosen market sectors once this momentum had been established broader growth opportunities were to be considered although by the spring of consolidation among major insurance brokers had resulted in significant shifts in the competitive environment the resulting large combinations were seen by the group to create opportunities as well as challenges the group intends to continue to pursue an aggressive change programme designed fundamentally to alter the way that it does business and to seize new development opportunities arising within the altered market place with the clear objective of enhancing shareholder value over time for further information contact willis corroon group ten trinity

when blue chip stamps merged into berkshire at the time of that merger i set down owner related business principles that i thought would help new shareholders understand our managerial approach as is appropriate for principles all remain alive and well today and they are stated here in italics a few words have been changed to bring them up to date and to each i ve added a short commentary although our form is corporate our attitude is partnership charlie munger and i think of our shareholders as owner partners and of ourselves as managing partners because of the size of our shareholdings we are also for better or worse controlling partners we do not view the company itself as the ultimate owner of our business assets but instead view the company as a conduit through which our shareholders own the assets charlie and i hope that you do not think of yourself as merely owning a piece of paper whose price wiggles around daily and that is a candidate for sale when some economic or political event makes you nervous we hope you instead visualize yourself as a part owner of a business that you expect to stay with indefinitely much as you might if you owned a farm or apartment house in partnership with members of your family for our part we do not view berkshire shareholders as faceless members of an ever shifting crowd but rather as co venturers who have entrusted their funds to us for what may well turn out to be the remainder of their lives the evidence suggests that most berkshire shareholders have indeed embraced this long term partnership concept the annual percentage turnover in berkshire s shares is a small fraction of that occurring in the stocks of other major american corporations even when the shares i own are excluded from the calculation in effect our shareholders behave in respect to their berkshire stock much as berkshire itself behaves in respect to companies in which it has an investment as owners of say coca cola or gillette shares we think of berkshire as being a non managing partner in two extraordinary businesses in which we measure our success by the long term progress of the companies rather than by the month to month movements of their stocks in fact we would not care in the least if several years went by in which there was no trading or quotation of prices in the stocks of those companies if we have good long term expectations short term price changes are meaningless for us except to the extent they offer us an opportunity to increase our ownership at an attractive price in line with berkshire s owner orientation most of our directors have a major portion of their net worth invested in the company we eat our own cooking charlie s family has or more of its net worth in berkshire shares my wife susie and i have more than in addition many of my relatives my sisters and cousins for example keep a huge portion of their net worth in berkshire stock charlie and i feel totally comfortable with this eggs in one basket situation because berkshire itself owns a wide variety of truly extraordinary businesses indeed we believe that berkshire is close to being unique in the quality and diversity of the businesses in which it owns either a controlling interest or a minority interest of significance charlie and i cannot promise you results but we can guarantee that your financial fortunes will move in lockstep with ours for whatever period of time you elect to be our partner we have no interest in large salaries or options or other means of gaining an edge over you we want to make money only when our partners do and in exactly the same proportion moreover when i do something dumb i want you to be able to derive some solace from the fact that my financial suffering is proportional to yours our long term economic goal subject to some qualifications mentioned later is to maximize berkshire s average annual rate of gain in intrinsic business value on a per share basis we do not measure the economic significance or performance of berkshire by its size we measure by per share progress we are certain that the rate of per share progress will diminish in the future a greatly enlarged capital base will see to that but we will be disappointed if our rate does not exceed that of the average large american corporation since that was written at yearend our intrinsic value a topic i ll discuss a bit later has increased at an annual rate of about a pace that has definitely surprised both charlie and me nevertheless the principle just stated remains valid operating with large amounts of capital as we do today we cannot come close to performing as well as we once did with much smaller sums the best rate of gain in intrinsic value we can even hope for is an average of per annum and we may well fall far short of that target indeed we think very few large businesses have a chance of compounding intrinsic value at per annum over an extended period of time so it may be that we will end up meeting our stated goal being above average with gains that fall significantly short of our preference would be to reach our goal by directly owning a diversified group of businesses that generate cash and consistently earn above average returns on capital our second choice is to own parts of similar businesses attained primarily through purchases of marketable common stocks by our insurance subsidiaries the price and availability of businesses and the need for insurance capital determine any given year s capital allocation as has usually been the case it is easier today to buy small pieces of outstanding businesses via the stock market than to buy similar businesses in their entirety on a negotiated basis nevertheless we continue to prefer the purchase and in some years we get lucky in in fact we made three acquisitions though there will be dry years also we expect to make a number of acquisitions in the decades to come and our hope is that they will be large if these purchases approach the quality of those we have made in the past berkshire will be well served the challenge for us is to generate ideas as rapidly as we generate cash in this respect a depressed stock market is likely to present us with significant advantages for one thing it tends to reduce the prices at which entire companies become available for purchase second a depressed market makes it easier for our insurance companies to buy small pieces of wonderful businesses including additional pieces of business we already own at attractive prices and third some of those same wonderful businesses such as coca cola and wells fargo are consistent buyers of their own shares which means that they and we gain from the cheaper prices at which they can buy overall berkshire and its long term shareholders benefit from a sinking stock market much as a regular purchaser of food benefits from declining food prices so when the market plummets as it will from time to time neither panic nor mourn it s good news for berkshire because of our two pronged approach to business ownership and because of the limitations of conventional accounting consolidated reported earnings may reveal relatively little about our true economic performance charlie and i both as owners and managers virtually ignore such consolidated numbers however we will also report to you the earnings of each major business we control numbers we consider of great importance these figures along with other information we will supply about the individual businesses should generally aid you in making judgments about them to state things simply we try to give you in the annual report the numbers and other information that really matter charlie and i pay a great deal of attention to how well our businesses are doing and we also work to understand the environment in which each business is operating for example is one of our businesses enjoying an industry tailwind or is it facing a headwind charlie and i need to know exactly which situation prevails and to adjust our expectations accordingly we will also pass along our conclusions to you over time practically all of our businesses have exceeded our expectations but occasionally we have disappointments and we will try to be as candid in informing you about those as we are in describing the happier experiences when we use unconventional measures to chart our progress for instance you will be reading in our annual reports about insurance float we will try to explain these concepts and why we regard them as important in other words we believe in telling you how we think so that you can evaluate not only berkshire s businesses but also assess our approach to management and capital allocation accounting consequences do not influence our operating or capital allocation decisions when acquisition costs are similar we much prefer to purchase of earnings that is not reportable by us under standard accounting principles than to purchase of earnings that is reportable this is precisely the choice that often faces us since entire businesses whose earnings will be fully reportable frequently sell for double the pro rata price of small portions whose earnings will be largely unreportable in aggregate and over time we expect the unreported earnings to be fully reflected in our intrinsic business value through capital gains we attempt to offset the shortcomings of conventional accounting by regularly reporting look through earnings though for special and nonrecurring reasons we omitted these from the annual report the look through numbers include berkshire s own reported operating earnings excluding capital gains and purchase accounting adjustments an explanation of which occurs later in this message plus berkshire s share of the undistributed earnings of our major investees amounts that are not included in berkshire s figures under conventional accounting from these undistributed earnings of our investees we subtract the tax we would have owed had the earnings been paid to us as dividends we also exclude capital gains purchase accounting adjustments and extraordinary charges or credits from the investee numbers we have found over time that the undistributed earnings of our investees in aggregate have been as fully as beneficial to berkshire as if they had been distributed to us and therefore had been included in the earnings we officially report this pleasant result has occurred because most of our investees are engaged in truly outstanding businesses that can often employ incremental capital to great advantage either by putting it to work in their businesses or by repurchasing their shares obviously every capital decision that our investees have made has not benefitted us as shareholders but overall we have garnered far more than a dollar of value for each dollar they have retained we consequently regard look through earnings as realistically portraying our yearly gain from operations in our look through earnings were million and in that same year we set a goal of raising them by an average of per annum to billion in the year since that time however we have issued additional shares including the b shares sold recently so that we now need look through earnings of billion in to match the per share goal we originally were shooting for this is a tough target but one we still hope to hit we use debt sparingly and when we do borrow we attempt to structure our loans on a long term fixed rate basis we will reject interesting opportunities rather than over leverage our balance sheet this conservatism has penalized our results but it is the only behavior that leaves us comfortable considering our fiduciary obligations to policyholders lenders and the many equity holders who have committed unusually large portions of their net worth to our care as one of the indianapolis winners said to finish first you must first finish the financial calculus that charlie and i employ would never permit our trading a good night s sleep for a shot at a few extra percentage points of return i ve never believed in risking what my family and friends have and need in order to pursue what they don t have and don t need besides berkshire has access to two low cost non perilous sources of leverage that allow us to safely own far more assets than our equity capital alone would permit deferred taxes and float the funds of others that our insurance business holds because it receives premiums before needing to pay out losses both of these funding sources have grown rapidly and now total about billion better yet this funding to date has been cost free deferred tax liabilities bear no interest and as long as we can break even in our insurance underwriting which we have done on the average during our years in the business the cost of the float developed from that operation is zero neither item of course is equity these are real liabilities but they are liabilities without covenants or due dates attached to them in effect they give us the benefit of debt an ability to have more assets working for us but saddle us with none of its drawbacks of course there is no guarantee that we can obtain our float in the future at no cost but we feel our chances of attaining that goal are as good as those of anyone in the insurance business not only have we reached the goal in the past despite a number of important mistakes by your chairman but have now with our acquisition of geico materially improved our prospects for getting there in the future a managerial wish list will not be filled at shareholder expense we will not diversify by purchasing entire businesses at control prices that ignore long term economic consequences to our shareholders we will only do with your money what we would do with our own weighing fully the values you can obtain by diversifying your own portfolios through direct purchases in the stock market charlie and i are interested only in acquisitions that we believe will raise the per share intrinsic value of berkshire s stock the size of our paychecks or our offices will never be related to the size of berkshire s balance sheet we feel noble intentions should be checked periodically against results we test the wisdom of retaining earnings by assessing whether retention over time delivers shareholders at least of market value for each retained to date this test has been met we will continue to apply it on a five year rolling basis as our net worth grows it is more difficult to use retained earnings wisely we continue to pass the test but the challenges of doing so have grown more difficult if we reach the point that we can t create extra value by retaining earnings we will pay them out and let our shareholders deploy the funds we will issue common stock only when we receive as much in business value as we give this rule applies to all forms of issuance not only mergers or public stock offerings but stock for debt swaps stock options and convertible securities as well we will not sell small portions of your company and that is what the issuance of shares amounts to on a basis inconsistent with the value of the entire enterprise when we sold the class b shares we stated that berkshire stock was not undervalued and some people found that shocking that reaction was not well founded shock should have registered instead had we issued shares when our stock was undervalued managements that say or imply during a public offering that their stock is undervalued are usually being economical with the truth or uneconomical with their existing shareholders money owners unfairly lose if their managers deliberately sell assets for that in fact are worth we didn t commit that kind of crime in our recent offering and we never will you should be fully aware of one attitude charlie and i share that hurts our financial performance regardless of price we have no interest at all in selling any good businesses that berkshire owns we are also very reluctant to sell sub par businesses as long as we expect them to generate at least some cash and as long as we feel good about their managers and labor relations we hope not to repeat the capital allocation mistakes that led us into such sub par businesses and we react with great caution to suggestions that our poor businesses can be restored to satisfactory profitability by major capital expenditures the projections will be dazzling and the advocates sincere but in the end major additional investment in a terrible industry usually is about as rewarding as struggling in quicksand nevertheless gin rummy managerial behavior discard your least promising business at each turn is not our style we would rather have our overall results penalized a bit than engage in that kind of behavior we continue to avoid gin rummy behavior true we closed our textile business in the mid s after years of struggling with it but only because we felt it was doomed to run never ending operating losses we have not however given thought to selling operations that would command very fancy prices nor have we dumped our laggards though we focus hard on curing the problems that cause them to lag we will be candid in our reporting to you emphasizing the pluses and minuses important in appraising business value our guideline is to tell you the business facts that we would want to know if our positions were reversed we owe you no less moreover as a company with a major communications business it would be inexcusable for us to apply lesser standards of accuracy balance and incisiveness when reporting on ourselves than we would expect our news people to apply when reporting on others we also believe candor benefits us as managers the ceo who misleads others in public may eventually mislead himself in private at berkshire you will find no big bath accounting maneuvers or restructurings nor any smoothing of quarterly or annual results we will always tell you how many strokes we have taken on each hole and never play around with the scorecard when the numbers are a very rough guesstimate as they necessarily must be in insurance reserving we will try to be both consistent and conservative in our approach we will be communicating with you in several ways through the annual report i try to give all shareholders as much value defining information as can be conveyed in a document kept to reasonable length we also try to convey a liberal quantity of condensed but important information in our quarterly reports though i don t write those one recital a year is enough still another important occasion for communication is our annual meeting at which charlie and i are delighted to spend five hours or more answering questions about berkshire but there is one way we can t communicate on a one on one basis that isn t feasible given berkshire s many thousands of owners in all of our communications we try to make sure that no single shareholder gets an edge we do not follow the usual practice of giving earnings guidance or other information of value to analysts or large shareholders our goal is to have all of our owners updated at the same time despite our policy of candor we will discuss our activities in marketable securities only to the extent legally required good investment ideas are rare valuable and subject to competitive appropriation just as good product or business acquisition ideas are therefore we normally will not talk about our investment ideas this ban extends even to securities we have sold because we may purchase them again and to stocks we are incorrectly rumored to be buying if we deny those reports but say no comment on other occasions the no comments become confirmation though we continue to be unwilling to talk about specific stocks we freely discuss our business and investment philosophy i benefitted enormously from the intellectual generosity of ben graham the greatest teacher in the history of finance and i believe it appropriate to pass along what i learned from him even if that creates new and able investment competitors for berkshire just as ben s teachings did for him an added principle to the extent possible we would like each berkshire shareholder to record a gain or loss in market value during his period of ownership that is proportional to the gain or loss in per share intrinsic value recorded by the company during that holding period for this to come about the relationship between the intrinsic value and the market price of a berkshire share would need to remain constant and by our preferences at to as that implies we would rather see berkshire s stock price at a fair level than a high level obviously charlie and i can t control berkshire s price but by our policies and communications we can encourage informed rational behavior by owners that in turn will tend to produce a stock price that is also rational our it s as bad to be overvalued as to be undervalued approach may disappoint some shareholders we believe however that it affords berkshire the best prospect of attracting long term investors who seek to profit from the progress of the company rather than from the investment mistakes of their partners intrinsic value now let s focus on two terms that i mentioned earlier and that you will encounter in future annual reports let s start with intrinsic value an all important concept that offers the only logical approach to evaluating the relative attractiveness of investments and businesses intrinsic value can be defined simply it is the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life the calculation of intrinsic value though is not so simple as our definition suggests intrinsic value is an estimate rather than a precise figure and it is additionally an estimate that must be changed if interest rates move or forecasts of future cash flows are revised two people looking at the same set of facts moreover and this would apply even to charlie and me will almost inevitably come up with at least slightly different intrinsic value figures that is one reason we never give you our estimates of intrinsic value what our annual reports do supply though are the facts that we ourselves use to calculate this value meanwhile we regularly report our per share book value an easily calculable number though one of limited use the limitations do not arise from our holdings of marketable securities which are carried on our books at their current prices rather the inadequacies of book value have to do with the companies we control whose values as stated on our books may be far different from their intrinsic values the disparity can go in either direction for example in we could state with certitude that berkshire s per share book value was however that figure considerably overstated the company s intrinsic value since all of the company s resources were tied up in a sub profitable textile business our textile assets had neither going concern nor liquidation values equal to their carrying values today however berkshire s situation is reversed our march book value of far understates berkshire s intrinsic value a point true because many of the businesses we control are worth much more than their carrying value inadequate though they are in telling the story we give you berkshire s book value figures because they today serve as a rough albeit significantly understated tracking measure for berkshire s intrinsic value in other words the percentage change in book value in any given year is likely to be reasonably close to that year s change in intrinsic value you can gain some insight into the differences between book value and intrinsic value by looking at one form of investment a college education think of the education s cost as its book value if this cost is to be accurate it should include the earnings that were foregone by the student because he chose college rather than a job for this exercise we will ignore the important non economic benefits of an education and focus strictly on its economic value first we must estimate the earnings that the graduate will receive over his lifetime and subtract from that figure an estimate of what he would have earned had he lacked his education that gives us an excess earnings figure which must then be discounted at an appropriate interest rate back to graduation day the dollar result equals the intrinsic economic value of the education some graduates will find that the book value of their education exceeds its intrinsic value which means that whoever paid for the education didn t get his money s worth in other cases the intrinsic value of an education will far exceed its book value a result that proves capital was wisely deployed in all cases what is clear is that book value is meaningless as an indicator of intrinsic value purchase accounting adjustments next spinach time i know that a discussion of accounting technicalities turns off many readers so let me assure you that a full and happy life can still be yours if you decide to skip this section our recent acquisition of geico however means that purchase accounting adjustments of about million will now be charged against our annual earnings as recorded under generally accepted accounting principles gaap and we may well make other acquisitions that will increase this figure in the future so this is a subject of importance to berkshire in our annual reports also we will sometimes talk of earnings that we will describe as before purchase accounting adjustments the discussion that follows will tell you why we think earnings of that description have far more economic meaning than the earnings produced by gaap when berkshire buys a business for a premium over the gaap net worth of the acquiree as will usually be the case since most companies we d want to buy don t come at a discount that premium has to be entered on the asset side of our balance sheet there are loads of rules about just how a company should record the premium but to simplify this discussion we will focus on goodwill the asset item to which almost all of berkshire s acquisition premiums have been allocated for example when we recently acquired the half of geico we didn t previously own we recorded goodwill of about billion gaap requires goodwill to be amortized that is written off over a period no longer than years therefore to extinguish our billion in geico goodwill we will annually take charges of about million against our earnings this amount is not deductible for tax purposes so it reduces both our pre tax and after tax earnings by million in an accounting sense consequently our geico goodwill will disappear gradually in even sized bites but the one thing i can guarantee you is that the economic goodwill we have purchased at geico will not decline in the same measured way in fact my best guess is that the economic goodwill assignable to geico will not decline at all but rather will increase quite probably in a very substantial way i made a similar statement in our annual report about the goodwill attributed to see s candy when i used that company as an example in a discussion of goodwill accounting at that time our balance sheet carried about million of see s goodwill we have since been charging about million against earnings every year in order to amortize the asset and the see s goodwill on our balance sheet is now down to about million in other words from an accounting standpoint see s is now presented as having lost a good deal of goodwill since the economic facts could not be more different in see s earned about million pre tax on million of net operating assets in it earned million on million of net operating assets clearly see s economic goodwill has increased dramatically during the interval rather than decreased just as clearly see s is worth many hundreds of millions of dollars more than its stated value on our books we could of course be wrong but we expect geico s gradual loss of accounting value to be paired with increases in its economic value certainly that has been the pattern at most of our subsidiaries not just see s that is why we regularly present our operating earnings in a way that allows you to ignore all purchase accounting adjustments in the future also we will adopt a similar policy for look through earnings moving to a form of presentation that rids these earnings of the major purchase accounting adjustments of investees we will not apply this policy to companies that have only small amounts of goodwill on their books such as coca cola or gillette we will extend it however to wells fargo and disney which have both recently made huge acquisitions and are consequently dealing with exceptionally large goodwill charges before leaving this subject we should issue an important warning investors are often led astray by ceos and wall street analysts who equate depreciation charges with the amortization charges we have just discussed in no way are the two the same with rare exceptions depreciation is an economic cost every bit as real as wages materials or taxes certainly that is true at berkshire and at virtually all the other businesses we have studied furthermore we do not think so called ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization is a meaningful measure of performance managements that dismiss the importance of depreciation and emphasize cash flow or ebitda are apt to make faulty decisions and you should keep that in mind as you make your own investment decisions the managing of berkshire i think it s appropriate that i conclude with a discussion of berkshire s management today and in the future as our first owner related principle tells you charlie and i are the managing partners of berkshire but we subcontract all of the heavy lifting in this business to the managers of our subsidiaries in fact we delegate almost to the point of abdication though berkshire has about employees only of these are at headquarters charlie and i mainly attend to capital allocation and the care and feeding of our key managers most of these managers are happiest when they are left alone to run their businesses and that is customarily just how we leave them that puts them in charge of all operating decisions and of dispatching the excess cash they generate to headquarters by sending it to us they don t get diverted by the various enticements that would come their way were they responsible for deploying the cash their businesses throw off furthermore charlie and i are exposed to a much wider range of possibilities for investing these funds than any of our managers could find in his or her own industry most of our managers are independently wealthy and it s therefore up to us to create a climate that encourages them to choose working with berkshire over golfing or fishing this leaves us needing to treat them fairly and in the manner that we would wish to be treated if our positions were reversed as for the allocation of capital that s an activity both charlie and i enjoy and in which we have acquired some useful experience in a general sense grey hair doesn t hurt on this playing field you don t need good hand eye coordination or well toned muscles to push money around thank heavens as long as our minds continue to function effectively charlie and i can keep on doing our jobs pretty much as we have in the past on my death berkshire s ownership picture will change but not in a disruptive way first only about of my stock will have to be sold to take care of bequests and taxes second the balance of my stock will go to my wife susan if she survives me or to a family foundation if she doesn t in either event berkshire will possess a controlling shareholder guided by the same philosophy and objectives that now set our course at that juncture the buffett family will not be involved in managing the business only in picking and overseeing the managers who do just who those managers will be of course depends on the date of my death but i can anticipate what the management structure will be essentially my job will be split into two parts with one executive becoming responsible for investments and another for operations if the acquisition of new businesses is in prospect the two will cooperate in making the decisions needed both executives will report to a board of directors that will be responsive to the controlling shareholder whose interests will in turn be aligned with yours were we to need the management structure i have just described on an immediate basis my family and a few key individuals know who i would pick to fill both posts both currently work for berkshire and are people in whom i have total confidence i will continue to keep my family posted on the succession issue since berkshire stock will make up virtually my entire estate and will account for a similar portion of the assets of either my wife or the foundation for a considerable period after my death you can be sure that i have thought through the succession question carefully you can be equally sure that the principles we have employed to date in running berkshire will continue to guide the managers who succeed me lest we end on a morbid note i also want to assure you that i have never felt better i love running berkshire and if enjoying life promotes longevity methuselah s record is in jeopardy

is the first seminar of its kind as well as being the first interactive venture between merrill lynch and msnbc i would like to thank everybody for coming i hope you enjoy the seminar msnbc opening statements listen online host bruce thompson a vice president at merrill lynch and director of government relations was instrumental in getting this legislation passed he could not join us but has some prepared comments thompson listen the tax bill passed by congress and signed by the president really is an historic piece of legislation that will have a tremendous impact on everyone s financial future we need to take steps now to address our long term savings crisis americans are now saving less than at almost any time since world war ii and we have become a nation of spenders not savers everyone needs to save and invest for the future and that s why this bill is so historic it will help people save for their retirement for college education for a first home and for other personal needs the new tax bill includes a number of new and expanded provisions it includes an expansion of the traditional ira creation of a new ira called the roth ira creation of the education ira a reduction in long term capital gains tax rate and an increase in the estate and gift tax unified credit it includes a child tax credit and other education tax incentives and it includes a repeal of the excise tax on very large iras and retirement plan assets all of these provisions should mean a more secure future for all americans and that is why we are so excited about this new tax bill online host in this next segment vern martens vice president and manager of merrill lynch s tax advisory group will answer your questions here while jim mccarthy vice president and product manager for iras at merrill lynch will be interviewed live on msnbc in approximately minutes they will switch roles now we d like to welcome vern martens mccarthy presentation on msnbc overview of the taxpayer relief act of listen martens it is a pleasure to be here this evening by way of an introduction the new tax law change will affect a larger number of individuals than any tax law change since it will provide a greater number of benefits to individuals in the areas of investment planning retirement planning planning for your child s future education and estate planning unfortunately although this new tax law will provide a lot more planning opportunities for individuals it will also introduce more complexity and require more planning in order to implement these planning strategies the last time we had such a large tax law was in that law basically simplified the income tax planning and preparation this latest change greatly complicates planning and tax law preparation going into the future most of the new tax provisions will not take effect until next year this includes changes in the individual retirement accounts as well as the child tax credit education credits and changes in the estate and gift tax area at this time i would like to entertain questions that you may have question can both types of iras be used to pay for college expenses martens the answer to this question is yes however the roth ira is not available until next year so i am assuming that you are speaking about some time in the future withdrawals from regular iras for qualified higher education expenses will be subject to income tax but will avoid the premature distribution penalty qualifying distributions from the roth ira in the future may not be subject to income tax and would also not be subject to the premature distribution penalty question what are the new capital gains rates martens starting with sales of capital assets after may new capital gains rates will take affect for sales of assets between may and july any gain realized would be taxed at a maximum rate of provided the asset was owned or held more than months prior to sale for sales of assets after july assets have to be held more than months to be taxed on any gains at the rate thus under the new changes assets held one year or less will still be taxed at ordinary income rates which can be as high at assets held more than months and sold after july will be taxed at a maximum rate provided they have not been held more than months and assets held more than months will be taxed at the rate individuals who are in a tax bracket will be taxed at the maximum capital gains rate of on gains from assets held more than months question a question about capital gains tax on a home is it retroactive for example would a home sold with a capital gain in may of be covered by the increased shield or is the old exclusion the only remedy available martens yes this change is retroactive however for sales made between may and august individuals may have a choice between the old rules that apply this means that if taxpayers qualify they may elect to defer under the old rules capital gains on the sale of their home or they may elect treatment under the new tax law under the new tax law for any sale of a home maintained as the principal residence for at least two years that results in a gain up to of such gain would be excluded from income tax from a married couple filing jointly or up to of such gain would be excluded from income tax for a single taxpayer question should i still contribute to my regular ira and the new roth ira martens depending on your income and tax filing status you may be eligible to contribute to both iras however the maximum total contribution is still limited to the lesser of your earned income or which would have to be split between the two accounts whether you choose either the traditional or roth ira to contribute to depends on a number of factors contributions to a traditional ira may be more beneficial for individuals who are in a higher tax bracket during their contribution years and will be in a lower tax bracket during their retirement years question being a retiree receiving benefits am i considered to be participating in a pension plan martens as a retiree receiving benefits you are not considered an active participant in a retirement plan online host now vern and jim will switch roles jim will join us online and vern will join msnbc for a live interview welcome jim mccarthy marten presentation on msnbc impacts of the taxpayer relief act of listen mccarthy i would be interested in anyone s questions regarding the new ira legislation we at merrill lynch feel it s imperative that people make educated decisions and engage in effective financial planning to take maximum advantage of the new tax law question i am a year old man currently contributing pretax to my k my employer matches the first would it make more sense for me to reduce the portion going to the k still enough to earn the matching funds and put the remainder into a roth ira i hope to retire at years of age mccarthy at age i am going to assume that your career is still on an upward track as a result it is likely that your tax rate at retirement will be higher than it is currently in that case a roth ira merits serious consideration it will give you greater access than a k plan and at distribution the tax free accumulation will be hard to beat question all the information you ve covered so far talks about what can i do today mccarthy if you have not yet funded your ira for you should consider doing so as soon as possible this has two immediate benefits it maximizes the amount of tax deferred growth and if eligible it will give you a greater amount to potentially convert to a roth ira in finally if you are close to any of the income limits now is the time to assess any capital gains or other income you might be recognizing in the next few months with the aim of managing your eligibility for contributions in question is there any deadline for converting an existing ira into a roth ira mccarthy while there is no deadline for converting the special tax spread in may be particularly attractive as a result you may only want to wait if you don t have another option question if i convert my ira to a roth ira do i have to sell and rebuy my current holdings mccarthy you do not have to liquidate your holdings to do a conversion but any new contributions must be in cash question what are the rules for converting an ira to the roth ira mccarthy you must have modified adjusted gross income or less in the year in which you convert additionally for no apparent reason the tax law does not allow married individuals filing separately to do a conversion question does the new ira have minimum distribution requirements mccarthy the roth ira has no minimum distribution requirements while the account holder is living there are however minimum distribution requirements that will apply to an account holder s beneficiaries the exact rules that will be applicable to the beneficiaries should be published by the irs in very late question can you open one roth ira for a married couple filing jointly mccarthy roth ira contributions must be deposited into separate accounts as a result it s advisable that married taxpayers each maintain a separate account question does the five year holding period for qualified distributions from a roth ira refer to the length of time contributions have been in the account or the number of calendar years the account has been open mccarthy both new roth contributions work off of a five year timetable for example a contribution in starts the five year holding period for annual contributions made in and later years however each conversion is measured on a separate five year timetable in the case of a conversion that occurs in this will be measured on a separate timetable from any conversions that occurred in a prior tax year question how are the capital gains treated within a roth ira mccarthy roth iras like other iras enjoy tax deferred growth thus there is no capital gains treatment applicable to purchases and sales within the account if you meet the five year holding requirement and your distribution is for one of the purposes listed age death disability or first home purchase withdrawals are tax free if you do not meet the requirements gains in the account are taxable as ordinary income regardless of whether or not they would have qualified for capital gains treatment in a taxable account question if a grandparent funds an education ira for the grandchildren is it the grandparent s income or the children s parent s income that determines eligibility mccarthy it is always the contributor s income that limits eligibility to make a contribution because there is no family relationship required we anticipate that most people interested in an education ira will be able to find a family member or friend whose income is under the applicable limit question if i leave my job can i roll my k over into a roth ira do i have to pay tax on the profits mccarthy assuming you meet the income limit you can convert but not directly you must first deposit your k distribution into a traditional ira and then convert to a roth ira essentially your k distribution will be taxable at the point when you convert from the traditional ira to the roth ira if you have employer stock ask your tax advisor whether the special rules that apply to employer stock make it advantageous for you to roll this part of your distribution over question for is there a maximum adjusted gross income level where ira deductions are not allowed mccarthy for if neither you nor your spouse is covered by an employer plan you can make a deductible contribution no matter how high your income if one or both of you is an active participant in an employer plan then the limit for a couple filing jointly is to and to for single people online host this wraps up the first interactive seminar hosted by merrill lynch and msnbc business video thank you so much for joining us we would

financial.sector	date thu dec gmt server apache connection close content type text html small business loans we are small business finance specialists making loans to entrepreneurs is what we do read on for details of our various financial products historical overview allied capital is a publicly traded nationwide finance organization that specializes in providing financing to small businesses throughout the united states since allied capital has provided financial products and services to small businesses allied capital specializes in four primary areas venture capital international expansion capital small business lending and commercial real estate finance we have over million in combined total assets dedicated to small business financing and offer a number of financial products for the small business entrepreneur we are a unique financial institution because we understand the needs of the small business entrepreneur and can provide creative and flexible financing quickly to learn about some of our current investments visit some of our portfolio companies or peruse our database of representative investments venture capital allied capital is one of the oldest and largest publicly traded venture capital companies in the nation our typical investment is to a small business looking for between and million in growth or acquisition capital most investments are structured as subordinated loans with equity components such as stock options or warrants loans typically bear a current interest rate of about and generally have maturities of five to seven years with an interest only period for the first three years entrepreneurs find our product very appealing because we act like lenders and our equity participation is small we aren t like the vulture capitalists who often take the majority of the upside away from the small businessman or intrude in the daily business operations we have significant expertise in providing this kind of financing to the service sector as well as media especially radio distribution software development manufacturing environmental and retail concerns we aren t very high tech so experimental technologies such as bio tech space or cutting edge information systems do not appeal to us we also do not currently provide financing for early stage or start up companies international expansion capital allied capital is fortunate to have an arrangement with the overseas private investment corporation opic through which we are able to provide capital to small businesses that are expanding internationally for many small businesses such expansion type capital is very difficult to secure for companies expanding internationally it can be even more difficult the structure of our international expansion capital investments is very similar to our subordinated debt product with the added requirement that the small business be expanding into opic designated countries sba guaranteed loans through the small business administration sba allied capital is able to provide small business loans quickly don t be fooled not all sba lenders are alike because allied capital has such a strong track record we have been designated as a preferred lender by the sba this enables us to close loans quickly much more quickly than other sba guaranteed loan providers these loans are generally between and million and are flexibly priced with generous amortization terms we provide long term loans as well as financing for acquisition growth restructuring and construction in a wide array of industries including manufacturing retail service radio convenience store gas stations restaurants delicatessens bars hotels and motels commercial real estate loans small businesses often experience difficulty in finding commercial real estate mortgages to finance the real estate component of their business allied capital has focused on this issue and carved a niche in this area by providing such financing to entrepreneurs nationwide through several specialized programs hard to finance program allied capital provides short term bridge financing long term real estate financing sale leaseback financing and participation real estate financing between million and million the common thread to our real estate financing is that the real estate is tied to an enterprise or entrepreneur typical loans are to an enterprise with real estate facilities that a bank won t mortgage because the small business is the sole tenant instead we view sole tenantship as sufficient and take on such credit as a small business loan with the real estate acting as collateral types of properties we finance include office condominiums anchored and unanchored retail buildings industrial sites convenience store gas stations warehouses and mobile home parks we do not provide financing for multi family or single family projects rapid close program this program is directed toward borrowers who have stronger credit but for some reason do not meet all of the parameters of a conduit bank or insurance company allied capital will offer the same products as those in our hard to finance program but at less expensive rates ranging from to basis points over treasuries for longer term loans and to basis points over month libor for shorter term loans this program similar to the others is available for such properties as office condominiums anchored and unanchored retail buildings and industrial sites to convenience store gas stations warehouses and mobile home parks again this program is not available for multi family or single family businesses representative investments to learn more specific details about some of the investments we ve made we ve created a database of representative investments organized by industry this data does not represent any one portfolio but represents a broad cross section of all of our portfolios we hope this data will help potential entrepreneurs and business brokers to gain a better understanding of how we structure our investments the types of companies we lend to and our lending criteria we will continue to update this database periodically contact us now about allied capital

healthcare.sector	date thu dec gmt server ncsa last modified fri dec gmt content type text html content length complement inhibitors complement inhibitors t cell sciences is developing a new class of therapeutics based on inhibition of the complement system a key triggering mechanism for the human inflammatory response medical problems that result from excessive complement activation affect millions of people throughout the world and represent multi billion dollar market opportunities they include reperfusion injury the vascular and tissue damage that occurs following a heart attack or stroke tissue injury following a surgical procedure where the patient s blood supply is shut off and then restored hyperacute or chronic organ rejection following transplantation acute inflammatory injury to the lungs including adult respiratory distress syndrome ards autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis or lupus alzheimer s disease the company s first product candidate tp is now being evaluated in two separate efficacy trials a phase iia trial for ards and a phase i ii trial of reperfusion injury following lung transplants what is the complement system the complement system consists of a series of blood proteins that when activated undergo a cascading series of enzymatic interactions that ultimately trigger the human inflammatory response this complement cascade is similar in mechanisms and importance to the blood enzyme cascades that make up the coagulation fibrinolytic and renin angiotensin kinin systems understanding the latter three major cascades has produced a number of important and life saving therapeutic products which inhibit or enhance each of these enzyme systems for example tissue plasminogen activator t pa is an enzyme from the fibrinolytic cascade used to dissolve blood clots anti coagulants such as heparin inhibit the coagulation cascade ace angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reduce hypertension high blood pressure caused by the renin angiotensin kinin system to date no therapeutic products are available to regulate the complement system tp now undergoing human clinical testing is the lead compound in this new class of therapeutics cascade system drug products coagulation warfarin heparin fibrinolytic t pa streptokinase renin angiotensin kinin ace inhibitors complement none the complement system s role is to defend the body rapidly and aggressively from infection or injury it can be activated through infection by microorganisms such as bacteria by direct cell injury or during an immune response when activated the first protein in the system splits creating an enzyme that then activates the next protein and so on in a sequential fashion the resulting enzyme cascade drives the inflammatory response that is necessary to protect the body however this response may also be destructive if inappropriately or chronically activated activation of the complement cascade causes many down stream inflammatory events e g increased permeability of blood vessels the activation and attraction of neutrophils and the formation of the complement membrane attack complex which injures and kills tissue directly in ards complement activation causes increased blood vessel permeability of the lungs that results in fluid and blood cell leakage into that organ during a heart attack complement activation during the time of reperfusion kills the already injured tissue significantly increasing the amount of damage to the heart acute complement mediated conditions ards reperfusion injury hyperacute allograft rejection xenograft rejection u s population n a chronic complement mediated conditions glomerulonephritis systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis alzheimer s disease multiple sclerosis the economic opportunity available to a successful complement inhibitor is enormous the company estimates the market potential for complement inhibitors in the range of to billion an amount similar to the markets realized by drugs for other cascade systems soluble complement receptor one tp is the soluble form of a naturally occurring complement regulatory protein complement receptor or scr this compound works at several points in the complement cascade to minimize all forms of complement mediated inflammation t cell sciences and its collaborators have evaluated tp in numerous preclinical animal models resulting in over peer reviewed publications since today approximately academic research collaborations relating to tp are in progress in studies reported in science tp reduced the area of heart tissue damaged by percent in a rat model of heart attack additional encouraging data have since been published supporting the protective effects of tp in limiting reperfusion injury in other models studies published in the journal of immunology show that tp significantly reduced complement mediated lung permeability in four different animal models in these models tp also produced significant decreases in blood vessel leakage since complement plays a major role in recognizing and eliminating foreign non self substances in the body blocking unwanted complement activation may prove important in organ transplantation by preventing hyperacute extremely rapid rejection of allografts same species transplants and xenografts cross species transplants in animal models of hyperacute and acute near term rejection published in transplantation and transplantation proceedings tp was shown to prolong significantly the survival of the transplanted organs in both allograft and xenograft models since the demand for organ transplants is greater than the supply of human donor organs xenotransplantation may become a realistic alternative to allograft transplantation if hyperacute rejection can be prevented clinical development under the company s direction researchers completed the first phase i clinical trial of tp in patients at risk for ards in ards affects over patients per year in the united states results of this trial were presented in october at the american college of chest physicians meeting a second phase i safety trial for reperfusion injury was completed in december in patients with first time myocardial infarction which affects approximately million americans per year this study was presented at the american heart association s joint conference on thrombosis arteriosclerosis and vascular biology in february in each of these trials tp demonstrated excellent safety and pharmacokinetic profiles with no drug related adverse events in addition the drug exhibited a clearance time of at least hours and was able to inhibit complement activity in a dose dependent manner with safety confirmed in two indications efficacy testing of tp began in the first complement inhibitor of any kind to advance to this level of testing in humans in january a phase iia clinical trial of tp began in patients ards in august enrollment began in a phase i ii trial of tp in patients with reperfusion injury following lung transplantation patient accrual for this trial was completed in may in october t cell announced positive results from the efficacy portion of our phase i ii clinical study of tp in patients undergoing lung transplantation the patient trial was aimed at evaluating the ability of tp to reduce reperfusion injury the vascular damage that often occurs following surgery or a heart attack where a patient s blood supply is shut off and then reintroduced and improve lung function in patients with end stage pulmonary disease who were undergoing lung transplant surgery the results showed that hours after surgery significantly fewer of the patients receiving tp required ventilation as compared to those receiving placebo moreover those patients who received tp and also underwent cardiopulmonary bypass as part of the transplantation procedure showed significantly decreased intubation time and time on ventilation reduction in the time that a patient requires intubation and mechanical ventilation typically translates to better clinical outcome and also implies an economic benefit from reduced time in the icu these findings in the area of reperfusion in a transplantation setting additionally support positive observations made previously in a phase i study of tp s ability to prevent reperfusion injury in patients undergoing heart attacks as a result we plan to conduct further studies of this drug candidate in a cardiac reperfusion setting complement inhibitor pipeline in addition to tp t cell has identified other product candidates to inhibit activation of the complement system the lead candidate in preclinical development is an altered form of scr tp which the company has modified to add slex carbohydrate structures slex is a sugar structure that mediates binding of certain white blood cells neutrophils to selectin proteins appearing on the surface of activated endothelial cells and platelets at the onset of inflammation selectin mediated binding of circulating neutrophils to activated endothelial cells is a critical event in inflammation compared to tp the combined scr slex molecule has demonstrated increased functional benefits in in vitro and early in vivo experiments and may be particularly useful in the treatment of heart attacks and stroke patents and proprietary rights patent protection covering cr based compounds is extensive among others the company holds patents or licenses to patents on cr including scr covering its composition its use in treating disease its use in combination with other drugs and means for its purification and production the company also has filed a patent covering compounds comprising scr and an adhesion inhibiting molecule such compounds may in certain clinical settings possess an additional capacity of binding to the walls of blood vessels damaged by the effects of inflammation this action both localizes anti complement activity to where it is needed and helps protect the damaged site from further injury by inflammatory cells commercial relationships tp was developed jointly by t cell sciences and smithkline beecham from to in february t cell sciences regained all rights to the drug still held by smithkline beecham and now has worldwide rights outside of japan to develop manufacture and market tp in japan smithkline beecham and yamanouchi continue to retain co marketing rights for the compound in october t cell announced the first of what we hope to be a series of collaborative agreements for our complement program this agreement with novartis pharma ag the worldwide leader in the transplantation field is for the development of tp for use in xenotransplantation animal organs into humans and allotransplantation human to human t cell will receive annual option fees and supplies of tp for clinical trials in return for granting novartis a two year option to license exclusive worldwide rights except japan to tp for the specified indications should novartis exercise its option to license tp it will make an equity investment in t cell and provide licensing fees and milestone payments based on the attainment of certain goals the combined option and license is valued at up to million t cell may also receive research funding in addition to royalty payments on eventual product sales in t cell granted the drug delivery company cytotherapeutics inc a non exclusive license covering certain patent rights to cr for use in their encapsulated cell products for the delivery of drugs to the central nervous system t cell sciences received a payment upon the signing of the agreement and will receive future milestone and royalty payments tp has the potential to be the flagship product in a new class of therapeutics called complement inhibitors with the development of complement inhibitors it may at last be possible to address a major cause of inflammatory tissue damage in critical medical conditions with previously unmet therapeutic needs updated december t cell sciences home page	
healthcare.sector	date thu dec gmt server ncsa last modified fri dec gmt content type text html content length small molecule immunoregulators small molecule immunoregulators t cell sciences aims to discover and develop novel small molecule immunoregulators that treat immune system inflammatory and infectious diseases by stimulating or suppressing the immune response based on the company s significant understanding of t cell mediated immune responses and signal transduction pathways within lymphocytes t cell sciences has developed high throughput assays to identify both immunosuppressive and stimulatory compounds broad based mechanism of action assays to identify specific targets within pathways screening for small molecule immunoregulators using these assays is an ongoing drug discovery program at t cell sciences conducted in partnership with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who provide drug development resources and or compound libraries the company has to date established access to synthetic compound and natural product libraries for screening through relationships with corporate partners arqule and repligen in addition t cell sciences has developed expertise in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as animal models to demonstrate in vivo efficacy of its drug leads the immunosuppressive molecules that t cell has identified through this program have potential as treatments for transplant rejection autoimmune disorders and inflammatory diseases immunostimulatory compounds discovered by the company are useful in the treatment of cancers infectious diseases and as adjuvants that increase vaccine effectiveness economic opportunities significant economic opportunities exist for small molecule drugs that suppress or stimulate the immune response immunosuppressive drugs are currently used to prevent or treat transplant rejection or to treat chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis that are associated with autoimmune disorders and or inflammation while current immunosuppressives such as cyclosporin a and fk are effective for certain indications such as organ transplantation the toxicity of these drugs dramatically limits their market application in less life threatening settings that require chronic drug use e g as treatments for autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis current worldwide sales of immunosuppressives are well in excess of billion annually experts estimate that the market potential for immunosuppressive drugs for use in transplantation alone will grow to billion worldwide by immunostimulants that boost immune responses against disease could provide new treatments for aids and other infectious diseases and cancer as well as provide new adjuvants to increase the effectiveness of vaccines applications for immunostimulants extend to animal as well as human health platform technology t cell sciences has created a platform technology for discovery of small molecule drugs that modulate key immune system pathways the company s discovery program is based on the use of several proprietary stable lines of t cells that are suitable for high throughput screening for immunoregulatory compounds that stimulate or suppress t cell activation the t cell lines are activated specifically through cell surface receptors tcrs using the company s proprietary anti tcr monoclonal antibodies with this system t cell sciences can access all potential targets along the signal transduction pathway leading to t cell activation ensuring that any compound that regulates activation at a point along that pathway will be identified t cell sciences believes that its receptor mediated screening assays are superior in several ways to most other t cell activation assays most other t cell assays activate t cells chemically at a point in the activation pathway downstream from the tcr thus immunoregulators that act at upstream signal transduction steps are missed by those assays receptor mediated assays also allow t cell sciences to identify compounds that regulate activation but have no effect on resting t cells in contrast calcineurin is involved in other cell functions besides activation thus compounds that act at this target may affect resting as well as activated t cells such compounds can produce unacceptable drug toxicities like those seen with cyclosporin a and fk t cell sciences assays can identify both compounds that inhibit t cell activation and those that stimulate it in contrast chemically activated t cell assays can only detect immunoinhibitory molecules t cell sciences goal is to identify compounds that act through mechanisms different from calcineurin and that have no effect on resting t cells in that way the company hopes to discover new immunoregulatory drugs that avoid the toxicity associated with cyclosporin a and fk results to date t cell sciences has established a variety of molecular and cellular assays of tcr mediated signal transduction which are used to elucidate the mechanism of action of lead compounds in a rapid and consistent manner to date the company has isolated several lead immunosuppressive compounds from both the combinatorial and natural product libraries provided by its biotech corporate partners for example one of the compounds that t cell sciences has identified inhibits a mouse model of delayed type hypersensitivity in a dose dependent manner with a dosage of mg mouse giving a comparable efficacy to cyclosporin dosed at mg mouse t cell sciences has also identified two classes of immunostimulators from its screening program one class augments the early stages of t cell receptor activation leading to enhanced t cell proliferation as well as il expression the other prevents activated t cells from undergoing apoptosis therefore leading to a prolonged t cell response the different mechanisms of action for these two classes of immunostimulators make them potentially useful for different clinical targets updated december t cell sciences home page

corporation second street p o box muscle shoals al for immediate release contact jerry a howard chairman and chief executive officer atrion announces million agreement to sell natural gas operations plans to use proceeds for strategic expansion of medical products business muscle shoals alabama march atrion corporation nasdaq nm atri announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its natural gas pipeline and marketing operations to midcoast energy resources inc amex mrs for approximately million in cash subject to certain post closing adjustments the closing of the transaction is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions as well as the notification and waiting period provisions of the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act and to approval by atrion s stockholders at the annual meeting of stockholders anticipated to be held in may or june the transaction is not contingent on financing since the early s as the market for the company s natural gas services has grown more competitive atrion has allocated substantial resources to the development and growth of businesses outside its traditional natural gas operations over the past three years the company has invested more than million in companies engaged in the development manufacturing and marketing of medical and related products through these acquisitions the company has added executives with considerable expertise and has gained significant experience in the medical products industry while implementing this diversification program the company has maintained its natural gas operations in the face of efforts by competitors and customers to bypass the company s pipeline systems and competitive pressures that have resulted in contract renegotiations and discounting after a thorough review of alternatives relating to continued operation possible expansion or disposition of its natural gas operations the board of directors of the company on the recommendation of management has concluded that a sale of the company s natural gas pipeline and marketing operations offers the greatest potential for maximizing stockholder value by providing the company with financial liquidity for future acquisitions outside the natural gas industry the board of directors believes that both the timing of the transaction and the price to be paid by midcoast are attractive and that for those and other reasons the transaction is in the best interest of the company and its stockholders in connection with its decision to approve the transaction at its march meeting the board of directors received an opinion from raymond james associates inc that subject to the matters set forth in such opinion the consideration to be received by the company in the transaction is fair from a financial point of view to the company jerry a howard chairman of the board president and chief executive officer of atrion remarked the agreement with midcoast represents a significant opportunity to accelerate the strategic shift of atrion s business toward medical products our actions to diversify the company s business beyond the natural gas industry and build a more growth oriented corporate structure began more than three years ago the acquisition in of a medical products company demonstrated atrion s identification of the medical industry as an attractive target market for our resources during we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to a specialized medical catheter system and we expanded our medical related operations further in through the acquisition of a manufacturer of valves and other medical components the operating income from our medical products business has doubled over the past three years from million in to million in as we have expanded our medical products operations we have continued to maintain our pipeline and energy marketing operations which we have now agreed to sell to midcoast howard noted that the subsidiaries being sold represented approximately of atrion s net book value of million at december and generated approximately of atrion s operating income of million for the year ended december mr howard stated this transaction clearly represents a major redeployment of the company s capital we plan to use the proceeds of the sale principally for acquisitions of medical product lines and companies involved in the development manufacturing and marketing of medical products our intent is to focus on operations that offer significant synergies with our existing medical products operations we anticipate moving prudently but as expeditiously as possible to accomplish the objective of adding assets that will enable us to build long term value for our stockholders after the closing of the transaction atrion will continue to own atrion medical products inc formerly ryder international corporation and halkey roberts corporation which comprise the company s medical products segment and alatenn pipeline company inc which owns the company s gaseous oxygen pipeline while the company has identified certain market segments and businesses within such segments with which it might be interested in discussing a stock or asset acquisition business combination or other similar type of transaction no agreements exist with respect to any such proposed transaction raymond james associates is also assisting the company in the identification of possible acquisition candidates and in the analysis of possible acquisitions in the medical products industry while the agreement with midcoast provides that the transaction is to be closed on or before july the company anticipates that if the transaction is approved by the stockholders the closing will take place as soon as practicable after the annual meeting at the closing the company is to receive cash of approximately million and is to transfer to midcoast all of the capital stock of alabama tennessee natural gas company tennessee river intrastate gas company inc and alatenn energy marketing company inc the purchase price is subject to certain adjustments subsequent to closing which will be based on the final determination of the consolidated net book value of the subsidiaries being sold in addition the company may receive deferred payments of as much as per year for an eight year period beginning in howard added we understand that midcoast s plans are to retain the personnel of the natural gas pipeline and marketing operations this is an attractive aspect of the transaction and will help ensure that the individuals who have contributed to the efficiency of these operations will continue to have viable career paths in a separate action the board of directors of atrion has declared a dividend of per share payable june to stockholders of record on may the board of directors also determined that commencing with the dividend payable on september the quarterly dividend will be paid at the rate of per share rather than at the current rate of per share the quarterly dividend will be reduced regardless of whether the proposed sale is consummated mr howard commented the board of directors concluded that if we were to retain our natural gas operations we should reduce the dividend to help us meet the funding requirements of both of our business segments if the proposed sale of our natural gas operations is consummated the reduction will bring our dividend more into line with other companies in the medical products industry and provide more resources for the company to invest in its ongoing business the board of directors will continue to review the dividend policy on a regular basis in the future atrion corporation formerly alatenn resources inc supplies its customers with innovative medical products and pipeline and energy services midcoast is a houston based pipeline company with offices in corpus christi texas topeka kansas tuscaloosa alabama and pachuta mississippi midcoast gathers transports processes and markets natural gas and other petroleum products and with this transaction will have more than company owned pipelines statements contained in this press release concerning the anticipated use of proceeds from the transaction and the possibility of future growth in the medical products industry are forward looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made such factors include the ability of the parties to complete the transaction and risks associated with the company s ability to identify and consummate

stratus based prepaid phone service total tel broadens mobile market with stratus based prepaid phone service marlboro mass september australian telecommunications provider total tel limited together with major carrier network vodafone has launched australia s first prepaid mobile phone service designed to attract a previously neglected market segment total tel prepaid mobile is implemented using a continuously available server system from stratus computer inc the innovative nationwide offering targets those who are unable or do not desire to sign a standard postpaid mobile contract this fast growing market includes the estimated australians who are turned away each month due to unsatisfactory credit the new service does away with credit checks contracts and monthly bills customers simply purchase a total tel prepaid mobile starter pack providing a subscriber identity module sim card a mobile phone number prepaid outbound calls and unlimited inbound calls for months compatible with any digital mobile phone the sim connects users with the gsm network operated by network vodafone total tel expects that australians will opt for a prepaid mobile starter pack in its first year on the market according to peter mcmillan total tel s director of international business sales are currently outpacing these projections well over starter packs have been activated so far prepaid mobile has been introduced in the uk the us italy south africa switzerland and other countries worldwide over the past year this pay as you go service has proven extremely popular everywhere in italy alone some million subscribers currently use prepaid mobile services sophisticated call handling and account processing the total tel service relies on custom created technology that is fully integrated within vodafone s exchange it incorporates a front end call handling and voice processing system from steadycom pty limited and a database server residing on a fault tolerant stratus continuum series computer application software was developed by cooee phone company a major shareholder in total tel ltd linked directly to vodafone s mobile switching center the front end technology provides vital call processing call routing and interactive voice response capabilities a tcp ip connection over a fully redundant mb ethernet link allows for split second interchange of customer account information with the stratus server when a customer dials a number the continuum database is instantly queried as to account validity and how much connect time remains on the prepaid account as the call proceeds the system performs real time monitoring of the customer s credit the front end voice system can send special tones to let the customer know how many call minutes have been consumed or warning tones as the credit runs down the system also enables customers to check on their account balances whenever they wish by dialing a four digit number from their mobile phones a recorded voice message announces the current account balance continuously available carrier grade service mr mcmillan stressed the importance of uninterrupted availability for these vital call handling and account processing functions because our equipment is installed within vodafone s exchange we needed a carrier grade solution that would deliver the same high quality that customers expect from other vodafone services he said if the system goes down calls will not be put through correctly or customer call charges will not be processed accurately so absolute reliability was a must after looking at several vendors fault tolerant products it was clear that the stratus continuum was our best choice total tel had initially considered software based high availability redundancy schemes but these were rejected because of their complex time intensive coding requirements we were operating on a tight schedule and didn t want to get bogged down in a protracted development effort that might cause us to miss the market mr mcmillan said mike summerfield stratus manager of telecommunications sales for australia and new zealand said the continuum platform gives total tel both a cost effective immediate solution and flexible options for future growth the continuum delivers all the power and performance they need right now at entry level pricing as the service s popularity grows and the system s current capacity is exceeded total tel can easily upgrade to a more powerful continuum processor or they can connect additional series systems in a cluster configuration they could even put another continuum system miles away in sydney for geographical load sharing and redundancy in case of an emergency mr summerfield said technology and business partnership stratus has worked closely with total tel from the project s inception providing technical support and helping the service provider explore new business opportunities as members of the technical team stratus database and performance specialists based in the us as well as australia played a key role in activities such as prototyping benchmark testing quality assurance and installation and implementation their participation helped the team complete system development within an extraordinarily short three month timeframe when it comes to technical support stratus has been far more than a vendor they ve been a true partner mr mcmillan said on the business side stratus is supporting total tel s efforts to offer similar continuum based prepaid mobile services in additional markets the computer company is sharing contact information and helping open doors to new total tel business opportunities across asia telecommunications industry players throughout this region recognize stratus position as a leader in continuously available solutions mr mcmillan said we certainly see this business relationship as a positive for our company total tel s future plans include migrating to a stratus based intelligent network in platform this would enable carriers to realize immediate revenue by implementing prepaid mobile today then cost effectively deliver additional in based subscriber services to meet new marketplace demands tomorrow mr mcmillan said about total tel and stratus total tel limited is an australian owned telecommunications company specializing in prepaid mobile phone services the company has been

features columnists smart managing and digital watch which focuses on technology the site can be slow and awkward to navigate at times you wish you were reading the print issue where it doesn t take a minute to turn the page but there are things here you won t find on the newsstand for example departments include useful lists of links to related resources on the web and an online archive lets you search back issues the site is rounded out with special reports such as a corporate reputation survey a technology buyer s guide and a collection of stories on the fortune listings the forbes digital

performance limitations of the internet home network has developed a high performance parallel internet while it uses the same underlying protocols to ensure compatibility and seamless access to everything on the internet home s network architecture is markedly different two key themes in home s network strategy are pushing data closer and end to end management to embody the first theme home network uses a hierarchical distributed network architecture with proprietary caching and replication technologies to ensure that information a user wants is always as close as possible within the network end to end management describes home s proactive network quality service and performance management systems because the network is centrally managed home can avoid the finger pointing that plagues the general internet and instead dynamically identify and address network quality service and performance issues before they ever affect users the primary components of home s network infrastructure include the atm backbone regional data centers rdcs local caching servers cable modems and the network operations center atm backbone home network operates its own national infrastructure which connects to the global internet at multiple network access points naps the network also has tier one peering with other national and regional internet service providers a high speed asynchronous transfer mode atm fiber optic backbone connects these access and peering interchange points to home network s rdcs home network s atm backbone provides a high performance cost effective scaleable transport mechanism as well as the capability to extend service to new markets without having to constantly reconfigure the network as it expands the backbone operates at oc mbps speeds and can be upgraded to higher speeds regional data centers rdcs home network s rdcs act as service hubs for defined geographic areas such as major metropolitan areas key activities at the rdcs include delivering home network s online multimedia content and services including world wide web email newsgroups and chat to subscribers monitoring and proactively managing network performance multicasting multimedia content and other data streams efficiently throughout the region replicating and caching media partners content and applications providing infrastructure to economically house cable operators local content and subscribers web pages local caching servers at the next level of the distributed network local neighborhood points of presence called headends are connected to each rdc consistent with the goal of pushing data as close to the customer as possible these headends deploy enhanced proxy servers for caching content benefits of using local caching servers to keep data close to the user include major performance improvements since the cache acts as a dedicated local server even for data that originated in the broader internet reduction in the amount of data movement in higher layers of the network far more comprehensive usage statistics than normally attainable on the internet these statistics can be used for tuning performance tailoring the service and targeting promotions and advertising cable modems in the home a cable modem connects to the cable television coaxial wiring and also attaches to the user s windows or macintosh computer via a standard ethernet connection in the near future internet appliances and similar devices may provide access cable modems are sold by several vendors including motorola hewlett packard bay networks and a number of smaller manufacturers the speed of the modem depends on the specific model but generally varies between mbps and mbps downstream to the home and between kbps and mbps upstream from the home network operations center noc home network provides end to end network management through the noc acting as mission control the noc uses proprietary network management tools and systems to monitor the network hours per day seven days a week identify and resolve potential issues before they affect the network and manage performance along the entire path from the content provider to the home computer from the centralized noc home can manage multiple rdc locations local caching servers and other network infrastructure home s carefully designed consistent system configuration and management also enable the noc to provide a high level of overall system security and reliability multiple delivery systems while two way hfc continues to provide the best medium for broadband service home network provides multiple solutions to reach customers not serviced by two way delivery systems telco return systems deliver data via high speed cable lines while upstream data travel over conventional phone lines as the vast majority of traffic is downstream the performance for telco return users is more than times faster than conventional dial up services while the information they send such as key strokes and

technology.sector	server netscape enterprise a date mon dec gmt accept ranges bytes last modified mon dec gmt content length content type text html home network top myths of xdsl xdsl vs home s hybrid fiber coaxial hfc cable modem network the facts the cable industry s hybrid fiber coaxial hfc cable modem networks are proven commercial products that deliver high performance reliable service and great value as of november approximately customers in north america are actively using the internet everyday at speeds never before possible using hfc cable modem services as a result of its breakthrough integrated product offering and cable industry partnerships home network has over share and growing of this explosively expanding market recently a few companies have announced trials or limited commercial deployments of digital subscriber line dsl technology while many incompatible variants of dsl exist e g sdsl idsl cdsl hdsl adsl vdsl the most commonly discussed are adsl asymmetric dsl and hdsl high bit rate dsl in the excitement of limited deployments a couple of myths have been promulgated in an attempt to forward xdsl s nascent cause xdsl can be deployed on existing copper wiring with no upgrades required and xdsl s dedicated connection enables better performance than cable modems in addition while xdsl technology is a potential advancement over current telecom capabilities like isdn it s worth noting that xdsl has fundamental technology limitations relative to hfc cable modem systems the balance of this note provides some facts to help objectively compare xdsl and hfc cable modem offerings plant upgrades for xdsl and cable modems both require some work while proponents of xdsl tout its use of copper telephone wiring it is a mistake to assume that it s a free lunch and that substantive plant upgrades of the telecom infrastructure will not be required to start carriers must remove load coils bridge taps and splits all of which are scattered across their plant today load coils block adsl s high frequencies and bridge taps reduce the signal and produce reflections on the line telecom carriers will also likely have to rehab outside plant osp components such as splice modules cross connects and terminals in an attempt to minimize near and far end crosstalk and to correct resistive and capacitive faults america s network a magazine of public network providers recently confirmed only a small portion of the osp facilities across the u s can dependably support adsl or any xdsl technology consistent with this finding one of the rbocs recently shelved plans for a subscriber adsl deployment when it found only about of its copper phone loops capable of handling adsl old and or abnormal premise wiring also presents a problem given that much in home wiring has been in place for more than years and has been deregulated for more than years it appears that internal wiring in many homes will have to be replaced in order to deliver adsl lantimes finally the networking infrastructure behind xdsl must be built from scratch which requires capital expenditure for new equipment for each incompatible xdsl variant used in each telephone central office co where it is deployed the cable infrastructure also requires upgrades to enable service infrastructure that is already hfc has to be way activated upgrade of non hfc infrastructure has been a focus of aggressive cable company deployments for the last several years as part of ongoing initiatives to improve quality expand channel offerings and enable other digital services currently over million homes in north america are way hfc dedicated vs shared access everything is shared at some level it s what s behind it that counts some xdsl advocates have attempted to contrast hfc cable modem s shared high speed neighborhood coax segment with xdsl s lower speed dedicated connection accompanying the contrast is often the allegation that xdsl will have superior performance when more customers are added to cable systems because the more cable modem users online the lower the speeds unfortunately this simplistic view overlooks a fundamental premise of modern data networks everything is shared at some level adsl in most viable implementations for example becomes a shared connection immediately after the local loop is terminated at the telephone co when many lines interconnect to the so called dslam digital subscriber line access multiplexer after concentration at the dslam shared data connections are passed through one or more isp interconnects and ultimately to the internet backbone typical concentration rates discussed for xdsl implementations are meaning that users with mbps rated adsl service would share a single mbps t isp connection further concentration may occur before eventually reaching an internet backbone given that xdsl and cable modems both integrate into shared data networks the real performance drivers are the ability to scale with the number of customers effective bandwidth provided per customer and backbone connectivity hfc cable modem systems proven scalability the shared high speed cable modem architecture is similar to local area networks lans used in offices everywhere the approach is particularly efficient and well suited to the bursty nature of internet traffic where surfing tends to consume bandwidth in discrete bursts intermixed with periods of inactivity with a high speed connection and internet traffic it is not correct to estimate bandwidth by simply dividing by the number of users for example a recent cablelabs test of cable modem systems demonstrated no detectable performance impact for up to concurrent web surfing users on a single coax segment given that cable system nodes the neighborhood level junctions where signals convert from fiber optic to coax typically cover homes and not all customers are active at the same time there s ample room for substantial penetration growth without any performance concerns when needed however hfc s fiber to the neighborhood approach has a great deal of flexibility for scaling local bandwidth with even very high penetration levels home and its cable partners can pragmatically and economically increase local capacity many times over in several ways including segmenting cable nodes and allocating additional frequency for home service e g another mhz channel out of the typical available in modern systems these approaches allow fine tuning the amount of bandwidth available as well as the number of users accessing that bandwidth more effective bandwidth per customer each home customer benefits from much higher effective bandwidth than any competitive offering or technology available the high effective bandwidth is the result of combining the cable industry s extensive fiber based networks home s high speed national backbone and advanced technologies that home has developed and integrated to enable sustained end to end high performance these core home technologies caching replication and multicast increase effective bandwidth by improving efficiency and reducing redundant data traffic superior backbone connectivity for top performance and reliability home has deployed its own high speed national backbone effectively a parallel internet in addition home is a tier service provider directly peering with other top isps at key internet network access points the combination ensures home customers the highest performance and least congestion possible no known xdsl providers have made the commitment to sustained end to end performance that home has if xdsl users just hook up to an isp they ll likely run into the same overloaded internet traffic jams as others experience today limitations of xdsl technology in addition to the substantially lower bandwidth carrying capabilities of copper wiring relative to coax e g mbps maximum for copper at typical distances vs mbps from just one mhz channel out of mhz total available xdsl has some marked technical limitations the most notable limitation is severe distance attenuation according to the chairman of the adsl forum with adsl alone only of homes and businesses will be able to be reached because they are too far from their respective cos distance attenuation rears its head when adsl upstream bandwidth drops precipitously from its kbps maximum down to just kbps or less for any customers beyond feet from the telephone co another exacerbating problem is near end cross talk next next is noise produced by t lines and other copper lines using dsl or isdn considering that the copper wires connecting a neighborhood to the main office are often bundled together when buried and only separate once the bundle reaches the neighborhood the impact can be substantial if adsl were widely used a large number of lines all with vexing next noise would converge in immediate vicinity near the main office crosstalk severely limits the ability to provide a consumer priced high penetration offering finally xdsl deployments have suffered from technology immaturity for example today adsl equipment makers sell six versions of adsl in two incompatible modulation standards xdsl modems are typically much higher priced than cable modems due to low volume and lack of standards e g each in contrast cable modems have standardized on the interoperable mcns specification the mcns cable modem standard paves the way for fast rollout affordable equipment and plug and play consumer devices in summary proven hfc cable modem technology has key advantages over xdsl rbocs don t have a free lunch on plant upgrades the cable industry has a sizable lead on commercial offerings and is aggressively moving forward on remaining hfc way deployments xdsl s dedicated connection becomes a shared connection quickly like every data network the true performance drivers are ability to scale with the number of customers effective bandwidth and backbone connectivity home was designed from the ground up to meet these challenges and hfc s inherent advantages combined with home s advanced technologies make high speed data services a reality today both xdsl and cable modem service will bring advances to customers but cable s hfc advantages with home s integrated solution ensure it will dominate company home work support advertising store

technology based integrated systems software and service that the company provides today diebold s commitment has always been to develop practical solutions for customer needs diebold timeline over the decades diebold has provided some intriguing products and services in the effort to satisfy those needs for example during the s and s the company also made jails jail corridor doors hangman trap doors and padded cells for asylums diebold worked with the lake erie chemical company in the s to develop a system to discharge tear gas in bank lobbies to assist in deterring the notorious john dillinger and his gang in the s its product line included checks and check printing the company s move into automated teller machines atms in the late s was one of a series of logical progressions in diebold s evolution another was its expansion into electronic security products earlier in the century the atm was a natural extension for diebold a long time leader in delivery systems such as drive up banking and teller counters which enabled financial institutions to serve their own customers better diebold went on to record countless firsts in atm technology in the decades of the s s and s diebold s progress has taken many turns from to the present but the company has never swayed from its dedication toward technology leadership and customer satisfaction diebold has been especially successful at understanding market needs and harnessing technology to serve those needs the early years quality and strength charles diebold a german immigrant founded the company in the business soon established a national reputation for high quality safes and vaults the company held the patents on at least different safes by when disaster struck one of the nation s major cities in it turned into opportunity for diebold following the great chicago fire diebold safes were discovered with their contents unharmed the middle years growth and innovation by the turn of the century diebold safe lock company s commitment to customer needs was well established to further its goal of providing the highest quality products and services to its customers diebold founded the industry s first nationwide service division in diebold s service organization remains the largest and best in the financial industry today with professionals in locations maintaining products and systems for customers nationwide technology leadership has been a common diebold trait throughout the years eighty two patents were issued to diebold between and for such products as vault doors and frames safes money chests locks lockers delayed time locks and various protective devices in for example diebold introduced a radical new design for bank vault doors the new rectangular door embraced the clean uncluttered look that was the trend in bank architecture after world war ii replacing the elaborate locking mechanisms operating wheels and levers that were visible on the previous generations of doors diebold s progression in the development of bank protection equipment was largely driven by the need to find materials that would withstand the inventiveness of the modern day bank robber diebold developed metal combinations and equipment designs to stave off the criminals use of increasingly sophisticated materials tools and techniques over the years following world war ii the american lifestyle became faster paced with the automobile playing an ever increasing role of importance diebold responded with the purchase of o b mcclintock company an early leader in drive up banking systems and electronic burglar alarms in the years following that purchase diebold developed a host of sophisticated electronic security solutions these ranged from systems capable of monitoring thousands of financial and commercial locations to the alarms video surveillance and access control systems used within these monitoring systems the modern era solutions for a changing world in the late s diebold president raymond koontz made a bold move that would further strengthen diebold s leadership in customer delivery systems for the financial industry by entering the new atm

downloading when i track my international package i sometimes get information on a package going to a different location or one already delivered why some tracking numbers in the fedex system are recycled and the tracking page may display information from another shipment in addition to or instead of yours to address this concern fedex has revised the tracking page to request an approximate ship date fedex customers with an account number can get even more accurate information using the advanced tracking page what is a status exception code an exception occurs when a package is temporarily delayed while in transit every effort is made to deliver every package as soon as possible so an exception does not necessarily denote a late shipment the status exception explains the most recent exception in the scan activity section the term pmx refers to a p m exception when a shipment is returned to a delivery station for the night because it was undeliverable during the courier s route such a delivery exception may occur because the package was incorrectly addressed a recipient was unavailable etc in many cases delivery is re attempted the next day can i track without an airbill in order to track your package you will need to use the airbill tracking number found above the bar code on the fedex shipping label all fedex shipments are assigned airbill numbers so you should be able to contact the shipper to find the number airbill numbers are digits long for u s domestic shipments and digits long for international there are no letters in the tracking numbers the tracking page doesn t seem to work could the problem be my web browser the fedex home page was constructed using current html standards these standards are supported by most but not all www browsers if you are a compuserve user with a mosaic browser you may wish to try netscape or a similar browser compuserve sysop suggests you go pcff to download netscape compuserve users may also

persist you may wish to contact aol technical support can i use the page to find out when my shipment will arrive although the tracking page can provide up to date tracking information there is no way

transportation.sector	server netscape enterprise f date thu nov gmt content type text html last modified tue jul gmt content length accept ranges bytes connection close fedex in the media wired magazine the airline of the internet wired magazine december fedex is piloting the next phase of the digital revolution it s a very big idea it s called logistics by todd lappin it s just past midnight and i m hunched over in the lower baggage hold of a boeing parked near the federal express package sorting facility at oakland international airport i m in here with two fedex freight handlers and a few feet above us on the main deck the jet is loaded fore to aft with tons of freight all neatly sorted and packed into air cargo containers that fit snugly within the arched contours of the fuselage but down in the underbelly where the space is too small for the containers to fit we re loading freight the old fashioned way by hand and as fast as is humanly possible the cargo door is swung wide open and packages are piling up on the baggage hold floor where a merciless conveyor belt carries them up from the tarmac below my task is to jam all the boxes into the cargo bay as tightly as i can because they ve got to get to portland oregon tonight a few hours from now absolutely positively the boxes are pouring in like water from a fire hose there are awkward crates of ford auto parts a few powerpcs samsung computer monitors tall cartons marked live plants poster tubes a cooler of blood samples and countless small boxes and flat envelopes emblazoned with the purple and orange fedex logo i m slipping and sliding on the curved aluminum walls of the s cargo hold and stacking the goods like cinder blocks heavy stuff on the bottom bulky stuff on top and little parcels crammed into any space that remains and still they keep coming one after the other until the baggage compartment is almost full i m getting squeezed out and the whole scene starts to feel like a nightmarish game of tetris played out in cardboard and sweat at moments like this i m tempted to fantasize that all the dead tree documents and cardboard shielded manufactured goods stuffed into the belly of this are but the residual dross of a second wave economic system charging headlong into its twilight years in a light speed age of faxes email document imaging ftp and pgp signatures mph jet freighters begin to look positively snail like and by the same token even a speed addicted company such as federal express can seem like a fossil fueled dinosaur if you subscribe to the theory that being digital means that bits not atoms will be the bedrock of economic activity in the information age but think again as our communications media shift away from one to many broadcasting and toward one to one interactive exchange precision targeted distribution systems that can move physical objects from point a to point b just in time are becoming more important than ever this trend coupled with the deregulation of transportation industries in the united states has fueled an all out effort by american businesses to cut costs by improving logistics efficiency already the results have been dramatic billions of investment dollars have been freed up for more productive uses in for example us logistics spending comprised percent of gdp with inventory investment consuming percent but by those figures had dropped to percent and percent respectively according to robert delaney of cass information systems in order to survive shipping carriers have had to become faster and more reliable those that couldn t make the transition simply aren t around anymore meanwhile the growth of mail order retailing and qvc style home shopping in recent years has been a bonanza for package shippers helping to push us revenues in the industry from us billion in to billion in and that s just the tip of the iceberg as online shopping and internet commerce become commonplace analysts predict that more and more consumers will shop from their desktops instead of the mall according to kurt salmon associates inc of atlanta such nonstore retailing accounts for roughly percent of worldwide consumer sales which totaled trillion in but by the firm estimates this figure will increase to about percent meanwhile a recent forrester research inc study predicts that worldwide revenues from online retailing will rise from million in to almost billion by with as much as percent of that total coming from the sale of hard goods such as apparel gifts food entertainment products and computer equipment the writing is on the wall and the biggest names in the package delivery business including fedex s arch rival united parcel service are hustling to the online retail bazaar for years fedex and ups have been going tit for tat in a battle to offer customers more delivery options at lower cost with greater convenience and reliability but looking toward the future neither company is content to survive merely as a high speed alternative to the us postal service instead both are gearing up to become full service logistics providers that specialize in orchestrating the flow of goods and information between customers retailers and suppliers still fedex remains a few steps ahead of ups in cyberspace in no small part because it has a more deeply ingrained tradition of looking to information technology for strategic inspiration and competitive advantage a tradition that goes all the way back to the days when fred smith founded federal express in the early s indeed if fedex has its way it will soon meld itself into an inseparable component of the global information infrastructure the objective to make fedex the official airline of the internet from street level fedex exists in the form of white delivery vans and smiling couriers dressed in blue yet behind that pedestrian fa ade is a company rooted in the world of information technology and distributed networks all those couriers are equipped with portable barcode scanners that function as the primary interface between fedex s physical network of jets and vans and its information network of computers databases and operations management tools the intimacy of this connection between the datasphere and the physical world is what enables fedex to accomplish its daily miracle of collecting sorting and delivering millions of packages to millions of addresses around the globe overnight these days fedex executives don t describe their business as a corporation a shipping company or even an airline instead they unselfconsciously proclaim that fedex is a network when pressed they go on to explain that the fedex network embraces two essential components a global network of planes and trucks used for moving bundles of atoms and an information network of digital technology that specializes in moving streams of bits fedex s strength derives from the fact that the company is a network amphibian equally at home with the task of switching packets of cardboard or packets of electronic data fred smith now fedex s ceo deserves much of the credit for this in business schools across the land smith has become something of a cult celebrity largely because of a story oft repeated in the case study canon that the federal express corporation traces its roots to one of his yale university term papers which outlined his vision of creating a delivery company based on a hub and spoke model that would offer overnight delivery service to a national market it s an inspirational tale but it plays fast and loose with a few key facts these days smith scoffs that term paper thing is just an exaggeration that got started in the media and perpetuated itself the truth of the matter he asserts is that his famous yale term paper had nothing to with what he calls the hocus pocus of the integrated air ground system instead smith insists it was an analysis of the relationship between logistics and the information technology industry circa the late s in the fedex genesis paper smith observed that any company that had recently replaced a roomful of clerks with a brand new ibm mainframe couldn t afford to have its mission critical computer system fail for an extended period yet he noted it was impractical to keep hundreds of expensive spare parts on hand as inventory connecting the dots smith arrived at the not entirely obvious conclusion that advances in information technology would stimulate demand for a totally new kind of logistics system a system that could replace physical inventories by moving packages of hardware almost as fast as a computer moves packets of data that burning bush insight enabled smith to identify the market niche that the fedex overnight delivery system was created to serve several years later but even more important it also reveals just how intimately the destiny of fedex has been linked to the future of the information technology industry since the company s inception in fred smith launched federal express from an abandoned military hangar tucked away in a dark corner of memphis international airport in tennessee during the company s early days in classic entrepreneurial style gung ho couriers delivered packages in family cars pilots bought fuel for company jets with personal credit cards and sales reps called customers from warehouse phone booths the infrastructure was crude but smith was keeping his eye on the digital horizon telling his new employees that fedex s success would be built upon a bedrock of mobile computers package tracking systems and sophisticated databases at the time recalls one fedex veteran a lot of it was pretty hard to imagine smith s high tech investments coupled with a lavish marketing effort quickly paid off within years fedex had racked up billion in revenues thus becoming the first american company to reach the billion dollar mark in a decade without mergers or acquisitions the firm today has revenues of billion and fedex has become a generic verb meaning get it there tomorrow morning that fact alone earns the company a special place in the annals of american product marketing right alongside other hall of famers like coke kleenex formica xerox thermos and jello fedex has become the largest express delivery company in the world by riding the leading edge of two trends that have revolutionized the shipping business since the late s the deregulation of the airline and trucking industries in the us and the rise of information technology these days fedex delivers million packages daily to countries around the world to accomplish this nightly miracle the company relies on a backbone of vans and trucks and planes a fleet whose size puts fedex in the same league as heavyweight airlines like delta and united but to understand how fedex plans to harness this massive cargo infrastructure to the internet i had to head down south to memphis the place where it all began he motto on the sign i passed leaving memphis international airport probably wasn t the first choice of the local tourism promotion board there s no hype about elvis presley s monument to pop culture excess at graceland no mention of the honky tonk blues bars clustered along beale street not a peep about the mud island park and museum perched near the bend where the mississippi river veers westward instead the sign announces welcome to memphis america s distribution center it s the kind of slogan that only a chamber of commerce could possibly love elvis might be the city s most famous son but these days fedex is king of memphis with local employees it s the biggest employer in town the city is home both to fedex s world headquarters and to its famous hub facility a sprawling logistical complex built on the site of the derelict hangar where the company first got its start memphis is no longer the only hub in the fedex system during the mid s the company abandoned the mainframe architecture of the hub and spoke system and evolved into a distributed network of freight processing nodes fedex now operates sorting facilities in indianapolis newark anchorage and oakland with overseas facilities in the united kingdom germany france and the philippines less than half of fedex s daily shipping volume passes through memphis these days but even now the sprawling superhub remains the largest in the fedex network each night at fedex air freighters begin descending from the tennessee sky like jet powered carrier pigeons homing in from all corners of the globe the freighters return to earth in second intervals one after the other after the other until more than of the birds are spread out over acres of tarmac by one in the morning they re all parked wingtip to wingtip a shadowy flock of dc s a s and a s and s in idle repose with freight doors swung open hollow decks glowing brightly headlighted luggage trains snake across the pavement at breakneck speeds their paths crisscrossing in a dance of near misses the cargo trains haul bedroom sized containers between the planes and a million square foot sorting facility where orange sodium lights shine down on a mile long rube goldberg labyrinth of ramps slides barcode scanners and high speed conveyor belts roughly million packages pass through the superhub sorting facility each night supervised by an army of anxious souls who shepherd each package into the container that goes to the plane that flies to the truck that drives to the van that takes it to the recipient there s an eeriness to this nightly hive ritual at the superhub with all the uniformed hustling amid floodlit darkness the place takes on a clandestine edge like the scene at some remote desert airstrip operated by a james bond supervillain or at area during a ufo recovery so much hidden from sight yet somehow taking place right under your nose not far from the superhub fedex s corporate headquarters are equally well concealed stripped of the company logo in an effort to elude job seekers a half dozen or so anonymous office buildings scattered along the southern edge of memphis international airport house the fedex management team the decentralized arrangement effectively breaks fedex s organizational chart into a distributed architecture a few vice presidents here a couple of project managers there all held together by networks of email bits and human atoms that bounce between scattered corporate nodes throughout the workday behind one of these straitlaced corporate citadels a low slung building squats buried under a vine covered earthworks shielded by walls of thick concrete formally known as the global operations center it serves as a subterranean command facility for the entire fedex distribution and delivery system employees call it the bunker the lighting in the bunker is subdued and a hushed intensity crackles through the climate controlled air on the walls giant flat panel projection screens display real time weather maps of the continental united states while workstations around the periphery stand equipped with banks of computer terminals and heavy black telephones a team in the back of the room specializes in domestic operations and another behind it focuses on surface transportation up front is the international unit a bevy of flight crew dispatchers are positioned off to the left and there s a handful of meteorologists tucked off in a dark corner it s pretty quiet here now explains bunker manager pete gwaltney but come midnight the place will be a whole lot busier at peak periods we operate in five minute decision cycles gwaltney s job is to keep the fedex distribution network running smoothly despite the inevitable grind of glitches and failures that plague any complex mechanical system but as he nonchalantly puts it this company spends lots of money preparing for contingencies to demonstrate the point he explains how fedex launches an empty jet freighter each night from portland oregon bound for memphis the jet tracks a course that brings it close to several fedex terminal airports so that if one of the jets parked on the ground suffers a sudden mechanical failure the empty freighter can swoop down and pick up the stricken plane s cargo the image of that empty fedex jet streaking through the night reminds me of the old doomsday bombers that were kept aloft and on alert during the cold war jeez i remark it s like strategic air command around here gwaltney smiles as if the same thought crossed his mind a long long time ago actually he says it s more like strategic freight command we walk over to the center of the room where a large computer sits alone on a white table a digital oracle perched on a formica topped altar positioned just behind the central command and control workstation where gwaltney sysops fedex s global network the computer is part of an experimental weather forecasting system developed by mit and the faa the image on the screen shows a local radar picture of the memphis area crisscrossed with a series of red and green lines gwaltney stares at the kaleidoscopic jumble like a fortune teller reading a crystal ball then he looks up smirks confidently and proclaims it s gonna pour five minutes from now and sure enough a few minutes later i m in the parking lot getting into my car as the first giant raindrops splatter across the windshield globetrotting jet cargo planes may have earned fedex a reputation for speed but the company s information structure keeps it in motion at the core of fedex s central nervous system is a proprietary online network called cosmos that tracks the status of every package flowing through the fedex distribution network from the instant the shipment is ordered until the moment it is delivered processing more than million transactions each day the cosmos network helps fedex achieve a percent on time delivery rate and allows the company to fine tune its shipping system by amassing reams of information about who is sending what where and to whom it s a core tenet of fedex gospel that the data about each shipment is just as valuable as the shipment itself with the success of cosmos fedex has leveraged its talent for information management to spin off a subsidiary called fedex logistics specializing in managing inventory flows and worldwide distribution for nonstore retailers or product suppliers these services are a dream come true fashion retailer laura ashley for example signed a year million contract with fedex to handle all aspects of the company s order fulfillment and distribution operations not only does fedex run all of laura ashley s warehouses taking care of everything from inventory management to packing and shipping but when mail order customers call laura ashley s service numbers they unknowingly speak to fedex employees who cheerfully answer laura ashley can we help you with so much to gain from turning paperwork into pixels both in terms of cost reduction and information dominance fedex has spent more than a decade bringing its network right to its customers front door and beyond since high volume customers have been given free powership systems dedicated pcs that directly connect with the cosmos network which automate the shipping process by making sure the information about each shipment is digitized from the moment a shipping order is placed a few years later in an effort to get out of the mail room and onto the desktop fedex began giving away dial up software called fedex ship that transforms any modem equipped macintosh or wintel computer into a part time cosmos terminal that can process shipping orders arrange for courier pickups track packages and create laser printed air bills now with nearly powership systems installed and customers using fedex ship software percent of all fedex shipping transactions are placed electronically through automated shipping systems but figuring out a way to integrate that remaining percent into the network is a problem that has nagged the company s online evangelists for years and then as luck would have it along came the world wide web the internet answered a lot of our prayers admits fedex s michael janes ultimately we don t care if it s your network or ours we just want the network to be everywhere janes vice president of electronic commerce and logistics marketing is charged with the task of selling the world on the idea that fedex will be a major player in internet commerce and judging by the way he s practically jumping across the conference table to tell me about his plans it s clear he s fired up about the assignment the web advertising paradigm is like pounding nails with a screwdriver he says most of the stuff on the web is useless brochureware you re scrolling through an online catalog and at the end you find yourself staring at a toll free phone number instead of an order placement window around here we call that commerce interruptus he cracks a wry smile while the joke sinks in if a customer has to go offline to complete a transaction then you re not going to make the sale cheap one to one marketing is what the web is all about the next level is to make online commerce get real our experience with our proprietary network is directly applicable to the public at large we want the web to be a primary interface for working with fedex we want to be the company that makes people feel comfortable doing commerce on the net thus far fedex has been using its now famous web site to field test this game plan since it was rolled out in late www fedex com has been a darling of online content critics simply because it is a web site that actually does something that might seem like a modest claim to fame but these days it s no small accomplishment at the fedex site compulsive cybernauts track the status of their fedex packages in real time without picking up the phone or tying up an expensive customer service operator who would otherwise have to provide the same information but the nifty package tracking is really only a curtain raiser the mule of our technology base as one manager described it by keeping close tabs on how customers use its web site fedex has diligently collected and analyzed heaps of customer feedback and usage data to understand how internet users conduct transactions on the web with that information in hand the company this summer added a new function to its site that makes it possible to order a fedex shipment from the web it s a real world example of internet commerce in action but even more important it essentially completes the transformation of any internet connected computer into a seamless extension of the cosmos network whether this means that fedex is absorbing the net or being absorbed by it is a question that s open for interpretation but the folks at fedex don t really care one way or another from their point of view the bottom line is simple you have been assimilated everything is proceeding according to plan on the third floor of one of fedex s unmarked office buildings just past a befuddling maze of burlap cubicles fred smith works from an unassuming office decorated with a dozen or so model jet planes arrayed on dark wood bookshelves straight talking energetic and intensely competitive at age he remains fedex s foremost strategic visionary with more than employees worldwide his company is long past its entrepreneurial phase yet smith remains a hands on manager and now more than a quarter century after he wrote the yale paper that got everything started the last pieces of his information gambit are starting to fall into place the way to substitute information for mass is to make a distribution system that s as good as a warehouse smith says with a slight memphis drawl if you think about it a warehouse is nothing more than a place to put something so you know you ve got it well i figured if we could provide the same degree of assurance to people electronically that their stuff is in the fedex warehouse be it on one of our mph planes or a mph truck then they would no longer need to have it in a warehouse smith is warming up over the past twentysomething years apart from the medical revolution and the microprocessor revolution the most significant thing to happen to the world has been the ability to take mass out of production he says the inventory to sales ratio of the whole industrial world has dropped like a stone during the last two decades and where does the internet fit in smith lights up the internet is going to accelerate the process the internet is going to make it very difficult for anybody in a middleman position to stay in business i cannot imagine how you can sustain any kind of a price premium when you ll be able to send an intelligent agent out to go price shopping from bombay to boston the same type of effect that wal mart had in the retailing sector that s what the internet is going to do to every business we re on the fulfillment end of all that all we have to do is execute very well and make sure the government stays out of the way advanced communications are going to create the market we ll facilitate what the technology permits when the telegraph came along there was a corresponding development of the rail system the telegraph created the connections and the railroad allowed fulfillment well today the internet creates the connections and we provide the fulfillment smith s analogy is pretty neat but it leaves a lot to the imagination to see how he is connecting the dots these days you have to head miles southeast of memphis to tempe arizona where a computer equipment direct marketer called insight direct inc operates a warehouse in an industrial neighborhood not far from arizona state university at insight fedex is beta testing its new secret weapon a back end electronic commerce software package for the web called businesslink if fedex s master plan is to play invasion of the body snatchers with the internet then businesslink will be the seed pod designed to integrate every component of the e commerce transactional chain into a unified network environment from order placement to billing and invoicing to inventory management to final delivery of stuff right to your doorstep fedex wants to position businesslink as a logistics tool that allows nonstore retailers to sell on the web with lower costs greater product variety and better customer service all this makes insight an ideal fedex guinea pig launched in with a credit card advance and an ad in a computer trade magazine insight direct is a fedex style entrepreneurial success story having grown to million in sales by direct marketing computer parts and peripherals at bargain basement prices the discount formula worked great for a while but as pcs have become more of a commodity insight s competition has grown fierce these days everyone from radioshack to compusa is jumping on the direct marketing bandwagon and profit margins are brutally slim to stay afloat insight expanded its product offerings moved into catalog sales and began targeting cash rich business to business customers carrying lots of products is a great way to stand out but it can entail fearsome risk in the six months is a lifetime world of information technology you re screwed if you get stuck with a warehouse full of expensive unwanted inventory enter precision logistics for companies like insight the way to offer lots of product variety while avoiding the inventory ball and chain is by drop shipping products direct from the manufacturer to the consumer therein bypassing insight s warehouse entirely in the jargon of the business such logistical hocus pocus is called virtual warehousing and basically it s a practical manifestation of fred smith s cherished notion of substituting information for mass nowadays insight drop ships whenever possible integrating its order processing labeling and package tracking systems with fedex s data network which in turn connects both to insight s customers and its suppliers so that roughly percent of the company s orders are drop shipped meanwhile as a test pilot for fedex s businesslink software insight is automating this whole process by transporting it to the final frontier of direct marketing the world wide web most of our customers are technical people so they already know you can do secure transactions on the web says denny chittick insight s year old vice president of information systems but the coolest thing about the fedex system is that the whole process is transparent to the customer they place an order at our web site it gets transferred to our vendor then fedex ships the product a lot of the time we never touch the actual product chittick breathes in deeply all we do is sit back and collect the money that s it that s fedex s bervision of the future a digital marketplace of cyberspace superstores operated by managers who need only worry about marketing customer service and counting the cash as it rolls in fedex promises to make all the pieces fit together and do all the heavy lifting in terms of invoicing inventory management order fulfillment and of course product shipping the payoff will come by pumping more packages though fedex s global freight network and by skimming a few percentage points off the value of each transaction in exchange of course for providing the software and systems integration that makes it all happen all in all it s a pretty subtle plan but fedex is facing some high profile competition from companies with different ideas about how to carve up the internet commerce pie actra business systems for example a newly formed joint venture between netscape and ge information services also hopes to win the race to become the bedrock platform for internet commerce transactions targeted at business to business customers actra is planning to transform the internet into a gateway for transactions using electronic document interchange edi a common e commerce protocol used by banks and businesses actra then plans to use edi links to integrate order entry billing and inventory management systems into the distribution network if all this sounds very similar to fedex s strategy it is but then again actra doesn t have its own fleet of planes trucks and couriers sabina norton a logistics specialist at mckinsey and company thinks this could prove to be either an advantage or a liability fedex already has the assets in place to make it all happen norton says somehow actra will have to acquire a freight capability that might give them more flexibility to offer a wider range of services but it may also mean that the level of system integration won t be as close fedex also has great name cachet in consumer markets that will probably count for a lot given how much people worry about electronic security actra may not have fedex s cargo hauling capacity or its phenomenal name recognition but fedex s most obvious competitor ups does after all with brown trucks roaming the planet ups s fleet is even more ubiquitous than fedex s and it s been around a hell of a lot longer since the company s founding in ups has spent much of this century building a rock solid reputation as a reliable if somewhat staid package delivery stalwart but when fedex came along ups was forced to undergo a dramatic transformation since entering the overnight delivery business in ups has fought head to head with fedex wielding a similar arsenal of jet airplanes and network linked information technology and while fedex retains a commanding percent of the overnight delivery market for letters and envelopes that weigh pounds or less fedex and ups are locked in a market share battle for overnight delivery of packages that weigh to pounds these days it takes more than speed to stand out in the crowd price and flexibility matter too thus fedex and ups now find themselves in the curious position of poaching each other s traditional domains with fedex offering a range of guaranteed delivery options at a variety of price points from fedex priority overnight to fedex day economy while ups has gone so far as to acquire sonicair an arizona based shipper that specializes in same day parcel deliveries when overnight just isn t fast enough typically for a pop simultaneously ups has also been building its digital infrastructure a process that didn t really get under way until the late s the reason for the late start in the information game explains frank erbrick senior vice president and chief information officer is that it took a long time for ups to realize that the rules of the package delivery game were changing largely as a result of competition from federal express ups was making a ton of money erbrick recalls we re still making a ton of money thank god but in the s some people started saying that there s more to delivering packages than moving a truck at mph down the highway or flying an airplane at mph across the sky at first we didn t believe that we didn t believe for example that our customers really wanted to be able to do package tracking we thought why the hell do they want to do that when percent of our packages arrive on time we thought the best way to run this business was to have a monumentally efficient operation efficiency in ups s case meant washing each of the company s brown delivery trucks nightly to preserve its life span and training couriers to board their trucks left foot first to keep physical motions to an absolute minimum such meticulousness kept operational costs down but it did nothing to address the day to day requirements of ups customers who needed tracking information automated shipping systems and the ability to redirect packages en route to their destinations the industry changed and we had to make a huge transition erbrick says well when you re a company with drivers vehicles a few hundred airplanes and most of all a corporate culture that says efficiency is measured in time motion units you re not received very well when you say you want to spend a couple of million dollars on computers ups had become successful by being better than anyone else at keeping costs low fortunately we realized that the old strategy wasn t going to work that s when we began our technological evolution by taking control of the information all along the line these days erbrick commands a billion dollar technology budget and boasts that ups s late start allowed the company to create a state of the art information network using the latest cutting edge technology and much like fedex s fred smith he s convinced that his company s future lies in cyberspace i want to manage our customers material from the point of its creation to the point of its utilization erbrick proclaims that s what logistics is all about the holy grail of this business is to manage the virtual inventory that s the goal and the company that can do that first is going to be the one that prevails the internet the intranet these are the vehicles of connectivity that will make it happen we re in the best position to put it all together perhaps but as ups is busy trying to transform its corporate culture fedex has hit the ground running the fundamental difference between ups and fedex says gregory smith from the colograph group inc in atlanta is that ups is a trucking company that s in the process of becoming an airline while fedex is an airline that s becoming more like a trucking company they re moving rapidly from opposite directions toward each other nobody beats ups on the ground and the company remains profitable by keeping costs down but fedex is a stepchild of deregulation it s more nimble and it does a great job of keeping a finger on the pulse of the marketplace out on the streets the refrain is similar on a sunny day in san francisco i ask a ups driver unloading packages from the back of his van to tell me how the two shipping rivals stack up ups and fedex are both great companies he says diplomatically resting his elbows on a battered hand truck we re top dog on the ground but they rule the air we both take customer service very seriously but a lot of the time i ve noticed that fedex is coming up with new ideas first at our management meetings the managers spend a lot of time sitting around and talking about whatever fedex is doing now he pauses for a moment to lift a black and white gateway box onto his hand truck sometimes i wish that we were the ones introducing new ideas otherwise it s going to get a lot harder for us to compete down the road it s the end of the working day and diane gotelli and i are nursing a pitcher of beer at the elko station deli a dusty strip mall roadhouse around the corner from the local fedex station in sunnyvale california gotelli has been a fedex courier driver for about years and together we spent the day riding around in her step body delivery van driving through sunnyvale s cookie cutter subdivisions dropping off and picking up packages and cheerfully talking about life work and the proper relationship between the two the circuit took us to symantec corporation s world headquarters a mervyn s clothing store a branch of sumitomo bank capital markets the castagnolo dental lab an office of fidelity national title and a tiny start up called leetech software we ate at boston market then visited bollinger travel service charles schwab the strong trading company the ranch style homes of a few middle aged telecommuters and so on a healthy cross section of the silicon valley economic landscape where technology rules the service sector thrives and time is always of the essence but now it s quitting time our pitcher is almost finished and buckets of rain have started to fall from the dark clouds hovering in the santa clara sky i ask gotelli what it s all about the constant running around the craving for instant gratification and america s wholehearted embrace of an overnight delivery service that has made federal express one of the greatest corporate success stories in recent history gotelli pauses to admit she s never really considered the question before then she smiles as if all of a sudden it starts to make sense well i think people just put things off as long as possible she says drinking down her last gulp of beer it s human nature to procrastinate and fedex is great at serving that need todd lappin telstar wired

overseas business traffic world via knight ridder march eagle usa airfreight has found a niche that many believe was already saturated the u s domestic forwarding market although eagle competes with hundreds of small to midsized forwarders as well as the big five multinational logistics companies the company has managed to win some very substantial contracts from a growing list of fortune companies including compaq motorola and ford founded in eagle started out slowly the company went public in december and has since posted record revenue and profits both ticking at above the percent growth mark business has been extremely good for eagle posting million in net income for the first quarter of up percent over last year revenue grew percent to million for the quarter ended dec eagle s biggest challenge may come later this year as it attempts to break its mold as a domestic forwarder and gain some of the sought after international business eagle has terminals in the u s with plans to add to more by the end of the year and reach an eventual total of the company has international gateways today and is cautiously attempting to increase its presence overseas international business isn t critical but it is a strategy we are pursuing said james r crane chief executive officer of eagle and recently named houston s entrepreneur of the year for we don t want to stagnate long term we know we are going to need to offer a wider range of services as companies continue to reduce the number of forwarders they use none of the other small domestic forwarders have ever done both well crane said we ve done our homework a lot of agents in asia and europe have a desire to do business with us because we have a good network crane likes the idea of being able to have exclusive arrangements with foreign agents but the pool of good agents is shrinking like fritz expeditors and aei eagle is hoping eventually to purchase its agents outright once the international operation is up and running eagle will operate two different profit centers with separate sales teams to better track the international business crane predicts the company will generate million in international sales less than percent of the million in revenue he sees for in the company posted revenue of million up percent over s million in revenue the international growth strategy will force eagle to compete with the likes of aei expeditors and fritz on a regular basis something it mostly has been able to avoid as a domestic forwarder its real competition comes from other midsized forwarders such as seko worldwide pilot air freight and associated global the difference is they have been in the game a long time and haven t grown their business crane said many midsized forwarders operate as franchises rather than as a centrally run company making the enforcement of standards and computerization more difficult he said another advantage is being a publicly held company it has given us a lot of credibility our customers can see our numbers feel us touch us it has given us new financial stability while a lot of others look quite shaky he said eagle usa also boasts low operating costs giving it a pricing advantage over integrated carriers like burlington air express and emery he said eagle relies on common carriage and domestic all cargo lift to move its freight our service is as good or better than the integrators crane said if we can t perform and live up to our time guarantees we ll lose the account therefore eagle uses only airlines that want to be in the cargo business eagle is one of the biggest accounts of continental airlines delta air lines and united airlines it also is a big user of lift from american international freight and kitty hawk cargo carriers are either with you or against you if their service isn t that good and they haven t shown any loyalty crane said he takes his growing business elsewhere return to news stories eagle usa airfreight sherry

terminals nationwide while maintaining its prudent financial health its over the counter common stock had its initial public offering at a share rocketed to split for and has marched up to the high s again its founder and president james r crane is a year old visionary who started the company from scratch in with a loan from his sister he has recruited a dedicated staff through generous bonus programs based squarely on performance eagle usa offices never close serving customers hours a day seven days a week thus contributing to its extraordinary service record for a base of more than customers these customers include such giants as compaq ibm packard bell electronics nike motorola at t ford and general motors its top customers account for more than of its revenues by eagle usa had revenues of million and crane sees no reason why the company won t keep up this brisk pace of growing revenues by to annually new eagle usa stations keep springing up throughout the united states with more planned domestically in canada and in mexico it also has its sights set on such european strongholds as london paris amsterdam and frankfurt we have never had to use our line of credit with the banks he noted we are very financially stable and that has allowed us to get the high tech equipment to compete with the integrators and to get good people we continue to recruit highly motivated air freight and trucking professionals we offer employees attractive incentive packages related donnie roberts who is in charge of sales for eagle usa we place no ceilings on their income they know that with us it s not a job it s an opportunity we have not gone the franchise route we have kept everything company owned that way we keep everyone looking at the bottom line looking for incentives we have very little turnover in an industry that is rife with it notes roberts today approximately people work for eagle usa and they are all eligible for bonuses that emanate from the performance at their own terminals the company is building a square foot headquarters office near the houston airport and will construct a square foot warehouse there as well the million project will be completed next autumn it also has room for expansion on the acre site crane estimates that of its business comes from air freight for this reason eagle usa has developed five tiers of time based service levels that it can offer to its customers nfo next flight out priority by noon the next day next day regular by pm the next day second day two days by pm economy three to five days by pm in approximately of its forwarding revenues came from next flight out and the priority shipments it also offer special handling pickups and deliveries crating and packaging charters international service and in house customs brokerage eagle usa has developed its own information systems that gives customers state of the art information services the company is expert at churning out new locations with initial start up costing as little as to plus staffing eagle usa therefore can have new terminals in as little as a few months however others have taken as long as five years to turn the corner on profitability crane noted with pride that the company has never closed an office eventually they have all made money we have come into some tough markets but we have never backed out of one we ve always made it work he said crane has made exploratory visits to europe and hopes to set up similar bonus systems for the terminal operations there roberts said the international expansions in north america will include mexico city and monterrey in mexico and toronto in canada in eagle usa started a customs brokerage operation in anticipation of its international service it also has started establishing a network of agents in over foreign locations in europe and the far east it now has a licensed customs broker and support staff the company itself is seeking to become licensed as a customs broker and to expand this aspect of the services it offers to customers at present eagle usa does not have a formal rating system for its suppliers however crane said the firm is also seeking iso certification and such a reporting system will be a part of the procedure we see ourselves as a non asset based company offering service let somebody else own the planes and the trucks we want to tie up all the variables in between he observed that the forwarder s abilities to compete with the integrators is good business for the scheduled airlines and they also give the customers greater flexibility for service the company appreciates the economies of scale in cargo space buying power and enhanced information systems that come with growth more importantly said one stock analyst the systems are aligned with internal accounting to provide management with substantial efficient and timely information on gross revenues net revenue and customer basis we know the total transactional costs down to the penny on every shipment crane revealed the company has daily reports on revenues and gross profits for each station this allows management to respond immediately if a station does not meet its revenue budget we have proven that the forwarder can not only exist in this market but can do an excellent job against the integrators crane said we savor the relationships with northwest cargo and the other carriers because we understand how important they are to the equation we work full time in developing that relationship current annual revenues are going to be about million crane revealed we are going to do about million of that internationally the international numbers should double or triple next year we have hired international staff in our large gateway markets and we are building on that staff eagle expects to have air freight terminals in place on the north american continent by with additional expansions overseas crane said eagle will focus first on europe although it has agents in asia and south america as well we will develop those lanes first where we can function at the most competitive level crane noted that customers today strive to cut the number of firms they use they don t want to use forwarders anymore he said they d prefer to use a company like ours that can do their domestic and international air freight that can make their local deliveries for them and help them manage their logistics systems instead of saying to the customer here s how we do business and you ve got to fit into this box we attack each customer s individual needs eagle usa tries to avoid small package business and has a goal of shipping pounds or more the average shipment is about pounds in the past year the company has opened new stations the company has five wholly owned

for northern air freight in he is cautious about mergers preferring to grow from within big mergers are hard to do nobody s done one well in our opinion he reflected we d do one if it is a good deal

up percent since dec ipo houston chronicle june to hear jim crane tell it growing eagle usa airfreight from two employees in to today has everything to do with common sense maybe that s why the company is so uncommon in the six months since its shares went public the houston company has broken from the pack to become a darling of the united states crowded freight forwarding business the earthshaking methods crane has used to fly eagle above its rivals crane repeats what has become the company s motto sell it service it and collect it crane founder and chief executive of eagle and his top managers say it is by doing these business basics that they ve become the nation s largest air freight forwarding company with terminals in u s cities paying attention to the fundamentals has kept eagle on track to increase revenues percent again this fiscal year to a projected million and cause it to split the seams of leased facilities at houston intercontinental airport to accommodate its burgeoning operation eagle plans to break ground soon on a million headquarters and warehouse on acres it purchased near the airport the reason eagle does the basics better than its competitors crane said is that it treats its employees better the company pays its people well above average for the industry and everyone from supervisors to dock hands participates in a profit sharing plan these pay policies unique in the historically low margin business are designed crane said to motivate the workforce to put forth extra effort there s a lot of people that do what we do we really kept to the basics always trying to hire the best people crane said when i got into the business i saw a lot of turnover somebody would move for i tried to pay our people so that wouldn t be a problem eagle has found a profitable niche by focusing on shipments of more than pounds thus it doesn t compete with the likes of federal express and ups which typically transport smaller packages and documents and because it doesn t have its own fleet of airplanes it is unlike integrated carriers such as burlington air express and emery air freight corp which aren t considered freight forwarders because they handle large shipments on their own jets in contrast the only plane eagle has is a corporate jet that is partly owned by crane and is used not to transport cargo but to carry crane and other executives to company offices and customers instead eagle relies on space available on commercial airlines to fly its customers cargo this provides greater flexibility and a nearly unlimited route schedule and it doesn t tie up assets for example it is p m and you need to send pounds of cargo the average weight of an eagle shipment to an assembly line in detroit by a m the next day while their competitors may already have flown their last flight or closed their offices for the night eagle can make the delivery on a number of airlines on a cargo carrier or by chartering a plane you re just not going to get that service from anybody else said bob block general manager of transportation and traffic for stewart stevenson services houston based stewart stevenson which makes and services all kinds of power equipment paid eagle last year to ship everything from boxes of the company s annual reports to truck parts to pound turbine engines used in power generators block said another of eagle s largest customers is houston based compaq computer corp which has selected eagle as its primary air freight shipper while the personal computer business is the company s largest market making up about percent of its revenue eagle recently has added customers as diverse as nike ford and general motors the growing base of customers has helped eagle achieve pre tax profit margins of about percent of sales the highest in the industry says james parker an analyst with humphrey robinson co one of the underwriters for eagle s stock offering in contrast san francisco based fritz cos a leading air freight forwarder that specializes in international cargo and is larger than eagle has profit margins of percent even fed ex has a margin of percent parker said this is the only highly profitable significant domestic freight forwarder he said clearly eagle s pay policies have paid off they are able to get the best people because they end up making the most money this is a people business parker noted they re getting more productivity and they are just doing a better job the practices have also kept employee turnover low if we want somebody they are not going anyplace because their deal here is too good said dan swannie vice president of operations whom crane credited as one of the key hires after he launched the company specifically eagle pays quarterly bonuses based in part on how employees in a work group rate each other in terms of teamwork employees also can earn a bonus each december equal to percent of their annual salary if their unit is profitable so an eagle warehouse worker making a year can make an extra percent through quarterly and annual bonuses while top salespeople can make several hundred thousand dollars in commissions moreover the company matches percent of employees contributions to the k retirement plan up to percent of an employee s salary finally the top managers are granted stock options following the company s initial public offering of stock on dec which raised million to help fuel eagle s growth founder crane a native of st louis began his career in that city after earning bachelor s and master s degrees in industrial safety from central missouri state university but he moved to houston in the early s at the urging of a friend who promised he could make or more as a salesman for a freight forwarding company for a short time swannie was crane s boss in houston and when crane started eagle in he subleased space from a company swannie operated crane soon lured swannie to eagle with a promise of part ownership and a few months later recruited as vice president of sales donnie roberts with whom crane also previously worked the trio has been together ever since with swannie handling the operations roberts building the sales force and crane setting direction and overseeing it all swannie now owns nearly percent of eagle usa s shares and is the company s largest shareholder behind crane who retains about percent of the million shares outstanding roberts owns percent of the stock jim was always willing to give up the financial rewards to people willing to put forth those efforts swannie said early on eagle was unwittingly funded by continental airlines which flew about percent of the company s cargo while continental was mired in its first trip through bankruptcy it failed to bill eagle for about nine months and we weren t shaking their tree to send us a bill crane admitted eagle did paid the bill but crane said eagle doesn t return the favor with its customers reminding them about the third operating tenet collect it if they re not going to pay us within the day terms consistently we are not going to finance them like continental financed us we can t afford it crane said to help maintain financial controls over its growing freight network eagle has built a sophisticated computer system that among other things provides detailed profit and loss data on all of its terminals which are run day to day by local and regional managers the reports provide an efficient system of checks and balances allowing the bosses in houston to pinpoint any problems in the field before they become serious i have a p l for every single office right here crane said looking over a thick computer printout i can tell you what oklahoma city paid on forklift fuel the company also allows field managers to really manage their own businesses and they get paid off the bottom line he said one of the most important items tracked is profit per shipment something not typically measured by competitors which focus on gross sales swannie said but this has helped the company weed out big volume customers that provide little profit to focus on more profitable ones the company has never opened an office that hasn t made money said crane who plans to expand to about terminals in the next couple of years the growing network provides existing customers with more places eagle can serve them and helps bring in more customers paul schlesinger analyst with donaldson lufkin jenrette securities noted in a recent report he rated the company shares to outperform the market in parts of the country where its network is weakest such as the northeast eagle will likely acquire companies crane said after the public offering the company is sitting on a ton of cash about million and has no debt he noted eagle is also expanding its local delivery operation to many of its cities using mostly independent contractor truck owners to pick up and deliver freight to for its customers in addition the company is moving overseas by signing up cargo agents in more than international locations crane expects international accounts to provide more than half the company s sales in the years ahead up from about percent this year crane majority shareholder in the company said it s not the money that is driving him any longer i like the business i m not that old and it s been fun i d like to see the thing stay stable and create opportunity for the rest of the people in the company he wants eagle to grow into a billion company which he figures will take six or seven years if it follows its steady growth pattern as long as it is doing well i d like to run it return to news stories eagle usa airfreight sherry amberg samberg eagleusa com intercontinental airport lodestar houston tx voice fax info

for sharing knowledge in the organization houston business journal october how does your company ensure that its employees are working towards a common set of objectives how do you prevent different areas of your organization from reinventing the wheel it all comes down to sharing knowledge in the organization eagle usa airfreight the winner of the arthur andersen enterprise award for sharing knowledge in the organization provides their employees access to needed information and the tools to share information with others eagle usa airfreight an air freight forwarding specialist provides a variety of transportation options including local pickup and delivery truck brokerage air charter as well as various other value added logistics services this company s philosophy of sharing knowledge extends to every member of the eagle usa airfreight team eagle usa s strategy to effectively share information is to make certain its processes are cost and time effective and then to document the processes these processes then become the cookie cutter from which all other terminals are fashioned terminals are not franchised so all managers work together to accomplish corporate goals equipment is mirrored from terminal to terminal which allows for smooth transfers of personnel from one terminal to another the computer system utilized by all employees is their most widely used tool for sharing knowledge the information system contains pricing shipping and other relevant demographic information about their customer accounting and employee databases the information is menu driven and limited by security levels at any time eagle usa airfreight can run a report to determine the profit loss on a given account time and attendance on a given employee or payment history on an account terminals are updated daily and the system is used by everyone in the organization hours a day this day to day knowledge is critical in monitoring fluctuating information determining the least expensive way to ship from point a to point b one of the key results of this process is knowing the current profitability of each terminal and sharing that information with the terminal manager the terminal manager then shares this and other pertinent information with other personnel all employees are offered incentives based on results and profitability of the terminal they work in on any given day the president of the company can see the profitability of each of the different stations and how they stand in relationship to each other said michael j sailor of arthur andersen l l p once the strategy and technology are in place it s the people that make it all happen employees are encouraged to share new ideas and are rewarded for suggestions that are implemented all employees are welcome to communicate with anyone in the organization through email and the internet this company is proud to have simplified the communication process by eliminating barriers to management the organization is based on a simple structure corporate communicates with regional managers who in turn communicate with terminal managers who in turn communicate with their personnel the average number of employees in an eagle terminal is this allows for a more personal approach to communications on a local level currently eagle is implementing a new scanning system which will allow them to track shipments anywhere in the process the new system will put the company at the leading edge of technology and provide them with an additional competitive advantage return to news stories eagle usa airfreight

a nasty habit of taking their customers no gimmicks or tricks mr roberts said we just move the freight actually there is something else involved here the key to the company s success is it moves freight that nobody else is moving sell service and collect said mr roberts whose rapid fire delivery tells you this is one salesman who would rather rush the net then sit back at the baseline look moving freight isn t rocket science anybody can move a box at o clock in the afternoon true but where eagle rides to the rescue for shippers is at two in the morning when it is after seven at night and the last fed ex plane has left for the day that is where we come in said mr roberts eagle usa which moves of its freight on the ground will pick up freight in those off hours and guarantees delivery the next day in the united states the secret is that it pays a premium price to the airlines to move it their customers in turn pay them premium prices still they may not make a lot on such deliveries many of which other forwarders and integrators would turn their nose up to complete eagle has used its unique services as the key to unlocking other business when you prove to a company

depreciation shareowner accounts grew from dec to approximately million accounts as of march revenues for the first quarter increased over first quarter and fam costs and expenses increased at a lower

extension of the base contract with t f m and we re now in discussions with g f m the mexican consortium that includes union pacific on a year maintenance agreement for the pacific north region as we have been saying we should know more by year end on both of these opportunities combined these regions currently use and maintain locomotives or percent of the entire mexican fleet we expect the number of locomotives to increase as the rails in mexico increase their share of market from percent today in the u s for example rails currently have about percent of the intercity freight market on another strategic front we have had continued success with sales of components to non nafta markets excluding mexico through the first nine months of the year we ve done about million in international sales approaching percent of total sales from our components group compared to percent a year ago and we have a record backlog of another million we re working on some pretty exciting new relationships in key markets that will be very important as we move forward and we should be finalizing these partnerships in the fourth quarter in addition discussions on alliances and joint ventures with large global o e m s have also continued to progress in the past we have told you that we are bound by confidentiality agreements from disclosing much information and that remains the case but i can tell you that as a direct result of these alliance discussions sales to these o e m s continue to increase bill fabrizio continues to make progress on acquisitions with several nearing completion we expect to announce one or two by the end of the year probably with revenues of around million each these two transactions are currently in the final stages of due diligence they will be profitable and additive to earnings immediately and they will meet our stringent criteria for real sustainable synergies so once again i am very pleased with our third quarter results i think they are the mark of a high performance company and demonstrate the type of sustainable and profitable numbers we want to achieve with consistency most importantly the momentum we have built is evident in our strong and increasing order backlog and the trends we see continuing for the next six months and beyond bill do you want to cover some of the financial specifics bill fabrizio cfo thanks mike and good morning everyone as you look at our third quarter income statement i m sure that a couple things will jump out at you first we generated solid sales growth in the quarter and for the first nine months of the year excluding divested businesses our sales were up a solid percent for the quarter more than double the pace of the u s and mexican economies as mike has said we re seeing excellent growth from our international export sales efforts but we re also seeing growth in our traditional nafta markets too with this growth we have more than offset anticipated lower sales of original equipment locomotives which contributed million of revenues in last year s third quarter second a big story for us this year has been the margin improvements that we have achieved for the third quarter in a row our gross margins and operating margins increased dramatically compared to the prior year quarter this was due to several factors higher sales volumes and resulting higher capacity yields cost reductions and productivity improvements coupled with a very favorable product mix in part what has happened is that we are booking more international sales which tend to have higher margins in addition our locomotive group has been very successful at achieving cost reductions and productivity improvements that we are now seeing on the bottom line can we sustain overall margins a lot depends on the continuing product mix as we ve said in the past we have over product lines with margins ranging from percent to percent we have however achieved cost reductions and productivity improvements that should be permanent and we are still working on the cost and expense side so we think there s room not only to sustain margins but grow them again depending on the product volume and mix as you look down the income statement you ll see that our g a expense was flat for the quarter although we had some expenses related to incentive programs and new marketing initiatives we were able to offset them with cost reductions elsewhere going forward we would expect g a expense to be around million we had no significant changes on the other line items of the income statement with the exception of taxes obviously if we re making more money we re going to pay more taxes but while we accrued taxes at percent in the quarter keep in mind that we re paying cash taxes at a lower rate because we have tax loss carryforwards in the u s and mexico with these carryforwards we can save about million in cash taxes in you can also see that our average shares outstanding increased during the quarter for two reasons first some stock options were exercised during the quarter second as the price of our stock has increased more options are in the money the corporation is continuing to generate strong cash flow with ebitda of million for the quarter and million for the first nine months debt net of cash and equivalents was about percent of total capital at the end of the quarter so we have some room to grow there all in all it was another excellent quarter for the company copyright motivepower industries

transportation.sector	server microsoft iis date thu nov gmt content type text html accept ranges bytes last modified mon oct gmt content length help on making queries making queries excite for web servers gives web users access to a sophisticated concept based searching engine but even though the search engine is advanced users can form queries without using a complicated query language this page will help you to choose the queries that will give you the best results query basics a query is simply a description of an information need unlike boolean systems that search for just those documents containing all the words in your query excite for web servers will search for documents that are a best match for the words in your query excite for web servers will also search for documents that are about the same concepts that your query describes so sometimes excite for web servers will bring back articles that don t mention any of the words in your original query what this means is that your query the description of your information need can be as detailed as you like don t worry about providing too many words the more words the better additional words in your query will help excite for web servers figure out what concepts you re really interested in on the other hand excite for web servers will do a pretty good job of figuring out what documents are interesting to you even if your query is vague for example let s say you re searching a web site for documents about customer support for the widget product you re using a good starting point would be customer support for the widget if you have a question about a particular feature of the widget for example the blurfl upgrade package you might choose a query like customer support for the blurfl upgrade package of the widget even if there are no documents that are actually about the blurfl upgrade excite for web servers will still show you documents about widget customer support advanced query tips here are some suggestions for getting the best results out of excite for web servers use more words the easiest way to narrow your excite for web servers search and the first thing you should try is to simply use more words in your query the greater the detail you provide the better excite for web servers is able to find precisely what you re looking for also try using the query by example option on the search results page use to require words put a plus sign in front of a search word and excite for web servers will make sure that all of the documents it returns contain the word example search travel france use to exclude words put a minus sign in front of a search word and excite for web servers will make sure that none of the documents it returns contain the word example search jaguar car automobiles use and or not and not excite for web servers supports full boolean operators and syntax you c an use the and or not and and not operators and parentheses for grouping example search swimming and man or woman using a plus sign to require words what it does excite for web servers will make sure that all of the documents it finds include the word s you specify as being required how to use it in your search text put a plus sign in front of words that must be in documents that excite for web servers finds do not put a space between the plus sign and the word for example to find documents about hockey but only those with the term nhl in them you could enter hockey nhl what s different about it without the plus sign excite for web servers looks for documents about any of the words in your search text excite for web servers will rank documents that have all of the words higher but will also list documents that have only some of your search words as well as documents that may have none of your search words but that appear to be conceptually related the downside you may miss related documents that don t have the words you specify as required for example the search hockey nhl would not include documents that have the words national hockey league but not nhl using a minus sign to exclude words what it does excite for web servers will make sure that none of the documents it finds contain any word s you specify to exclude how to do it in your search text put a minus sign in front of words that must not be in documents that excite for web servers finds do not put any space between the minus sign and the word for example if you want to find documents about zeppelin aircraft but not the rock band led zeppelin you could enter zeppelin led what s different about it without the minus sign excite for web servers looks for documents that are conceptually related to all the search words you provide rather than looking for items to exclude from the results the downside it s easy to exclude too much for example if you were looking for information on greyhound dogs and not the bus company the search greyhound bus would exclude a document that was all about greyhounds but that had the sentence the greyhound trainers arrived by bus boolean operators and or not and what they do how to use them and documents found must contain all words joined by the and operator note that this is equivalent to putting a plus sign in front of the word for example to find documents that have all of the words wizard oz and movie you could enter wizard and oz and movie or documents found must contain at least one of the words joined by or for example to find documents that have either the words cat or kitten you could enter cat or kitten and not documents found cannot contain the word after the term and not note that this is equivalent to putting a minus sign in front of the word for example to find documents that have the word pets but not the word dogs you could enter pets and not dogs parentheses are used to group portions of boolean queries together for example to find documents that have the word fruit and either the word banana or the word apple in them you could enter fruit and banana or apple what s different about it allows for excluding and requiring words and complex combinations of words the downside it s often difficult to specify exactly what you want to include or exclude you can also get unexpected results if you are not careful about your use of operators and parentheses for example the search bananas or apples and oranges is the same as the search bananas or apples and oranges both queries will find documents that contain both apples and oranges together with documents that contain the word bananas however the query bananas or apples and oranges is not the same it will find documents containing the word oranges and in the same document either bananas or apples be careful out there

s letter investment qualities profile management s discussion and analysis financial statements notes to consolidated financial statements year operations and financial review making sense of it all competition customers cost effectiveness culture dear shareholders i am very pleased to tell you about fiscal year one of the most outstanding years in indiana energy s year history benefiting from the coldest weather in a decade and by growing and managing our core gas distribution business and related gas marketing business we realized superior financial results we also made progress in dealing with the future of the evolving energy industry while we are proud of our past and current accomplishments it is the future upon which we all must focus this led us to the theme of this annual report the future making sense of it all before we look to the future though let s take a look at fiscal financial and operating highlights in fiscal we realized record net income and record earnings per share eps net income was million compared to nearly million in fiscal eps were versus last year the previous record for eps was in our return on equity of percent significantly exceeds last year s roe of percent to establish and measure performance we compare ourselves to a group of nearly peer companies local distribution companies selected by an independent investment banking firm in fiscal the estimated average roe achieved by our peers was percent because of the current and future outlook for company earnings indiana energy s board of directors increased the quarterly dividend in july from cents per common share to cents per share this percent increase brought the year s dividend paid to a record or annualized this is the th consecutive year that we increased dividends paid several factors contributed to our ability to achieve these outstanding results weather that was percent colder than normal this is a marked contrast to fiscal when weather was percent warmer than normal the continued strength of our service area economy which netted more than new residential and commercial customers and a percent increase in industrial gas throughput a continued strong focus on managing indiana gas core business and gas marketing affiliates that contributed percent to consolidated net income we believe that our incentive compensation plans were also a key in our ability to achieve these outstanding results bargaining and non bargaining employees companywide received maximum payout through our performance incentive plan because of their dedication and hard work in the areas of customer service safety cost control and achieving the above average roe likewise our management incentive compensation program is linked to achieving corporate goals including return on equity and increased shareholder value the increased margin resulting from the very cold weather allowed us to accelerate some projects that will help us maintain and strengthen our distribution system it also means we increased our operation and maintenance o m expenditures from last year s levels you may recall that last year s operating expenses were held well below budgeted levels to offset margins lost due to the extremely warm weather despite the percent increase in o m this year we remain committed to controlling these costs while weather may cause year to year fluctuations long term we plan to limit annual expense growth to an average annual rate below the consumer price index our total return for fiscal year was about percent and for the five year period ending in it was about percent although these returns are good relative weakness in our stock price at fiscal year end brought our returns to less than the averages for our peer group of nearly companies over the last years the total return earned for our shareholders ranks us fourth out of the nearly companies as i will discuss in the remainder of my letter i believe our strategy should help return our performance to the outstanding level we have achieved in the past we believe we are positioned to exceed the industry average for dividend growth some analysts are projecting to percent average dividend growth this coming year we re optimistic about our performance for several reasons our growing and diverse service area a supportive regulatory climate competitive prices our proven ability to control costs over time and an historically conservative dividend payout ratio that has enabled the company to increase dividends paid year after year the continuously changing energy industry requires us to be thughtful and creative about how we will grow the company differentiate ourselves from other utility investments and increase investor value so now let me share with you what we have been doing and here we are heading making sense of it all competition customers cost effectiveness culture these four words dubbed the cs represent the key areas upon which indiana energy and its primary subsidiary indiana gas must focus in order to excel in the evolving utility industry while we have been working to understand industry changes the past couple of years this year has brought an increased sense of urgency it has also led us to these four key areas one thing the accelerating industry change has not done is change the company s mission or its basic business of providing natural gas and related services to customers we are still committed to maximizing return to investors commensurate with business risks by providing long term value to our customers through safe reliable low cost products and services we will accomplish this through our employees and by supporting the communities where we live and work while the basic mission hasn t really changed we have had to change the ways we look at and operate our core gas distribution business as the industry becomes increasingly deregulated and as a result more competitive in order to be competitive and successful indiana gas can t rely on simply being able to deliver natural gas to its residential commercial and industrial customers bill them and then collect from them indeed we have continued to introduce expanded service options to more customers our larger volume industrial and commercial customers for example now choose which services they receive and from whom they receive them this is what s known as unbundled service or customer choice but being successful in the future entails more than developing unbundled services it requires a recognition of where the industry is heading and a willingness to change thinking and approaches to business it also requires that the company be proactive rather than reactive and that s exactly what we re doing competition competition in the utility industry is real and is here to stay it seems that every week there s word of another utility merger or strategic alliance independent energy marketing companies have become an important part of the landscape for indiana energy competition is one of the primary drivers in the company s decision making process competition in the gas business exists in several forms there s competition for gas transportation load and competition for the sale of the commodity to local distribution companies like indiana gas and to end use customers competition continues to exist between natural gas and other energy sources such as electricity and oil we expect competitive pressures will build as the electric industry continues to restructure about half of indiana gas throughput is already open to transportation service we believe that even the smallest of our customers would like to be able to choose their gas supplier much like they choose their long distance phone service provider and take advantage of competition just as many of our larger customers already do however we also believe that the transition to full customer choice needs to be managed so that it is offered in an easily understood manner with benefits that are clearly identifiable and readily achievable our efforts to be successful in the short and long term include several different initiatives the formation of a strategic alliance with citizens gas and coke utility of indianapolis this year is one example of indiana energy positioning itself for this new business environment this new entity proliance energy llc was formed to optimize the gas acquisition and supply resources of both companies its goal is to provide reliable energy solutions at more competitive prices than indiana gas is able to offer on its own in a niche market that includes indiana and surrounding states however the formation and operations of proliance have been challenged in hearings before the indiana utility regulatory commission iurc details on the challenge can be found on page we believe that proliance is a reasonable response to the changing utility marketplace and that it accomplishes several important objectives including indiana gas and its customers are shielded from the risk of paying above market prices indiana gas and its customers have experienced immediately reduced gas costs and over the next few years have the potential for further substantial reductions proliance ensures the presence of an indiana based provider of service that can compete with marketers for gas sales to end users and that will be a long term gas supply option available to customers of all sizes at a competitive cost and proliance provides an opportunity for indiana energy to be financially rewarded for the assumption of risks associated with the provision of gas supply we hope to have a decision from the iurc during the first half of calendar how the iurc addresses the issues related to proliance and to the competitive utility environment is very important to us all of our customers and stakeholders and many others in the industry we strongly believe that to be competitive in the future we ll need to replace the traditional cost of service regulation with performance based regulation we need ratemaking that encourages and rewards rigorous cost management and risk taking while ensuring quality customer service indiana has a state law that allows for innovative approaches to regulation for gas and electric utilities we expect to move toward performance based regulation or pbr in the future we believe that incentives work in a competitive marketplace and through pbr we would seek to create a balance between customer service and the financial objectives embodied in many cost control measures customers consumers are the spark driving the fierce competition as we have seen in other industries that are now deregulated such as telecommunications banking railroads and airlines competition creates the power of customer choice we believe that energy customers will expect unmatched value and more for less much like buying food clothing and long distance phone service in this new competitive environment this means the company must continue providing safe reliable low cost products and services however while low cost has been and will likely continue to be important we believe that value and service are also extremely important in we know that customers in all classes are pleased with the products and services they receive from indiana gas in fact our annual customer opinion survey shows steady increases in residential customer satisfaction the past three years surveys of other customer groups mirror that positive result we feel so strongly about customer service that it s one of the three components of our companywide incentive compensation plan indiana gas continues to realize strong customer and load growth in the residential commercial and industrial sectors customer additions continue at about percent annually industry growth averages about percent we are confident that our market will provide the opportunities to realize solid future growth one of the reasons we remain optimistic is the ongoing economic expansion and strength of our existing service area indiana gas serves an area that includes communities in of indiana s counties with a population of about million we reach from the ohio to illinois borders we serve communities along the ohio river in southern indiana and communities through north central indiana a unique distribution center with percent of the u s population within a day s drive indiana gas market is truly at the crossroads of america overall the indiana economy as well as that of the midwest continues to outperform the national economy various economic indicators for a recent month period show continued growth in the industrial sector total construction housing starts and retail sales seasonally adjusted unemployment rates average in the range of to percent in addition to our outstanding location and strong economy our customer base is diverse and growing it includes agriculture automotive and steel production pharmaceutical glass and food producers among other industries while customers are satisfied with indiana gas products and services we can t rest on our laurels to achieve outstanding financial performance we are focused on profitable customer growth and customer needs we want to know and understand even more about our customers needs even though in indiana there are no regulatory mandates to offer choices or unbundled service indiana gas has chosen to be proactive in this regard indiana gas currently offers unbundled service to customers using as little as dekatherms a year customers representing about half of our load can purchase gas from indiana gas or a third party during the first half of fiscal the company plans to file a request with the iurc for a new pilot program to further test the market and gain additional experience at providing unbundled service to smaller sized customers during the pilot aggregated load transportation would be offered to a group of small commercial customers in addition we see this time as an outstanding opportunity to develop new energy related products and services a management team is creating a process for identifying and evaluating new business opportunities it will also search for earnings growth opportunities we might pursue we will have results from this effort to incorporate into our fiscal planning cycle strong communities result in a good business environment for us recognizing this we actively support the cities and towns where we live work or provide service in fiscal we formed the indiana energy foundation to assist in these efforts through the foundation we provide financial support to organizations and activities that meet certain criteria we also encourage employees to volunteer their time and energy to community activities and needs our partners in community business retention and expansion program continues to assist local communities with economic development related issues cost effectiveness cost effectiveness is not a new idea at indiana energy its importance is well known and it s integrated into the company s ongoing business strategy employees are encouraged to look for opportunities to operate more efficiently and cost effectively in their daily routines and responsibilities to provide customers with more for less the company uses process improvement and activity based management techniques to better understand the costs of processes and services to identify room for improvement and to generate savings these also will help determine what it takes to be competitive in the marketplace and in which areas we can and cannot be successful performance based regulation would also provide incentives for the company to continue to generate cost savings to share with customers and shareholders information technology plays an increasingly important role in our ability to be competitive and operate cost effectively indiana gas has a comprehensive information technology plan to update its existing infrastructure and to implement several major new systems we re making a significant investment to adapt and implement an integrated customer information and work management system this new system which will be on line the summer of will allow employees to collect better manage and study important customer information to track and manage customer choice programs and to improve customer service we re also continuing to test mobile data dispatching technology which allows service specialists to receive and send customer information via personal computers in their trucks this makes us more efficient and helps us deliver better service to customers information technology also will give us the ability to expand our customer base cost effectively with the same number or fewer employees it also allows for more timely communication with various audiences both indiana energy and indiana gas have world wide web sites on the internet indiana energy s site located at http www indiana energy com features information of particular interest to shareholders and financial analysts indiana gas site at http www indiana gas com contains more general company product and educational information an internal web site or intranet is currently being tested within indiana gas culture culture is the way we think and act to be competitive indiana gas is adapting its culture to the changing environment the company is working with all employees to become more team based and to stimulate a performance driven environment focusing on improving processes and lowering costs we are making every effort to see that all employees work together to accomplish our corporate goals and objectives i believe our incentive plans training programs and increased employee participation in decision making efforts have helped us begin to achieve the intense focused teamwork we need and want in addition we are increasing the amount and frequency as well as improving the quality of communication across all boundaries the open candid exchange of ideas and information is a must we need to begin thinking that communication is the responsibility of everyone in the organization knowing where to focus efforts is important in business today however companies need their employees all moving in the same direction as a team we need to think safe reliable low cost service in everything we do we need to think prudently and creatively to see if there are better more cost effective ways we can do our jobs and meet our commitments to customers and the communities where we live and work we are working hard to do these things if we can accomplish these we will keep intact our outstanding operational and financial performance records and continue to build the same shareholder value in the future that we have successfully done in the past as always thank you for your continued support and confidence in our management team and employees copy indiana energy inc www indiana energy com

apr management changes apr consolidated earnings mar utilities form new gas management company jan quarterly dividend jan consolidated earnings september indiana energy inc receives favorable ruling regarding proliance energy llc indianapolis on september the indiana utility regulatory commission issued the decision in the complaint proceeding relating to the gas supply and portfolio administration agreements between proliance energy llc and indiana gas company inc and proliance and citizens gas coke utility the commission concluded that these agreements are consistent with the public interest the management of indiana energy inc believes that the decision is supportive of the utilities relationship with proliance in all material respects proliance is an indianapolis indiana based marketer of energy and related services and was formed in march of by affiliates of indiana energy and citizens gas this decision is particularly important because the commission has recognized that significant customer benefits can be achieved if utilities are encouraged to work toward innovative customer solutions in the changing energy marketplace as a result of proliance s provision of service to indiana gas and citizens gas in excess of million in gas costs savings will be realized for the customers of those utilities over the initial four and one half year term of the utilities agreements further the commission has recognized that benefits for investors are appropriate when risks are being assumed by those investors as a result of this decision indiana energy has determined that a substantial portion of the reserve it had previously recorded for earnings associated with proliance s gas supply and gas marketing business will be adjusted downward this will have the effect of increasing indiana energy s net income by approximately million the commission s decision suggests that all material provisions of the agreements between proliance and the utilities are reasonable in the decision the commission acknowledged that the utilities purchases of gas commodity from proliance at index prices as compared to proliance s actual cost is not unreasonable the commission also acknowledged that the amounts paid by proliance to the utilities for the prospect of using pipeline entitlements if and when they are not required to serve the utilities firm customers and the fees paid by the utilities to proliance for portfolio administration services are not unreasonable nevertheless with respect to each of these matters the commission concluded that additional findings in the gas cost adjustment process would be appropriate and directed that these matters be considered further in the pending consolidated gas cost adjustment proceeding involving indiana gas and citizens

date will be adequate to fund its share of costs presently incurred or expected to be incurred in connection with that program if future events require additional activities that are not presently

a power outage storms can and do cause power outages in our region during each season of the year whether it s a winter blizzard a spring ice storm or a summer thunder boomer electrical service is sometimes the victim here are some important tips to help prepare you for and to cope with a power outage stock up radios flashlights every home should have a battery operated radio flashlight and of course plenty of fresh batteries in fact don t wait until you hear there s a storm on the way before you run to the store and find them sold out water if you have enough warning before a storm hits and your water supply would be affected by an electric power outage fill your bathtub and spare containers with water for cleaning or washing do not leave small children unattended near a filled bathtub you might want to buy a few gallons of bottled water to have on hand at all times food if you know a storm is headed your way and may threaten your electric service turn your refrigerator on its coldest setting but remember to turn it back after the storm has passed food in a freezer will keep up to hours under those conditions if the freezer is full keep canned food a non electric can opener and other non perishables in the house just in case freeze dried or dehydrated foods can be prepared with a minimum of heat during an emergency a can of sterno in a holder on a flame proof surface can be used for cooking but never use charcoal indoors it releases deadly carbon monoxide gas don t go near downed wires treat all downed or hanging wires as if they are energized and stay away from them just because wires may have been knocked around doesn t mean they are dead report any downed hanging or burning wires to montana dakota or to the police or fire department appliances make sure all sensitive electric appliances such as microwave ovens vcrs televisions and computers are protected with surge suppressors for complete protection when a storm hits unplug as many appliances as possible be sure to turn off or disconnect appliances that would go on automatically when power is restored refrigerator freezer water pump and especially the stove if a burner is on when your power returns and there is a flammable object on the element it could start a fire once power is restored plug in appliances one at a time backup generators please do not use a backup generator if your mdu power has been disrupted by connecting a backup generator to your home electric circuitry you might energize our electric distribution lines and endanger our line crews who are restoring power don t forget gas safety your gas appliances buy only gas appliances with the american gas association blue star seal an indication that the appliance meets industry safety standards and make sure you follow the manufacturer s instructions only qualified technicians should work on your gas appliance call montana dakota utilities co or another certified gas appliance repair service check your gas flame periodically it should have a bright blue appearance a yellow or orange flame means the appliance needs service work don t forget to replace your heating system filter several times during each heating season combustion air is vital for gas appliances make sure no obstructions are blocking the appliance s air intake and regularly check the venting of your gas furnace and water heater by touching the vent pipe be careful if operating properly it will be hot if you smell gas we add an odorant to your natural gas so you can detect a leak should one occur if you think you might have a gas leak open all windows and doors to allow the gas to escape then call us using our local telephone number in your directory or our toll free number mdu fast if the gas smell is very strong leave the building immediately and use a neighbor s telephone also do not light any matches operate any light switches or electrical devices or pull plugs from outlets because any of these could ignite accumulated gas never use your gas range as a heater your gas range has one purpose to cook food it should never be used as a secondary source of heat when your oven door is left open it prevents the thermostat from cycling and periodically turning the gas off this constant burning could create a situation that could cause asphyxiation or fire we need your help before you dig don t go digging up trouble in recent years many utility services have been placed underground including natural gas electric cable television and telephone make sure the first step of your next digging project is a phone call for help in locating underground lines people digging holes whether homeowners or contractors often find more than they bargained for hidden beneath the soil and out of view are many miles of montana dakota s cables and piping that deliver energy we all need careless digging can rupture these facilities and often cause severe injury even death to the unwitting worker not to mention the loss of utility service to hundreds of people repairs can also be very expensive with spring here digging projects will be in full swing be sure you make a phone call before you break the sod this spring it could save your life in north dakota call your local montana dakota office and we will make arrangements to locate your underground energy facilities in montana call in south dakota call in wyoming call back drafting in our efforts to reduce heating costs many of us have turned to wood burning fireplaces and stoves as supplementary sources of heat along with natural gas furnaces however many homes are often too tight to provide adequate air for the safe operation of open flame heating systems fireplaces wood coal stoves natural gas furnaces etc we feel that everyone should try to conserve energy but after you weatherize you may need to add a combustion air source to prevent back drafting fireplaces require lots of air if there is not enough air to satisfy the requirements of a fireplace or wood stove as well as a furnace or water heater all burning at the same time the fireplace draft can pull toxic combustion products from these gas appliances back into the room this condition can seriously endanger health the products of combustion which may contain carbon monoxide must be continuously removed while the fireplace or stove is operating in fact any device that exhausts air from the home including kitchen or bathroom exhaust fans can contribute to the back drafting problem to check for back drafting start a fire in the fireplace on a cold day and after a few minutes touch the vent pipe of the furnace water heater or any space heater careful they may be very hot if the vent is cold your fireplace could be creating a dangerous back draft turn down the thermostats and water heater temperature controls let fireplace burn down and call a heating contractor or your local montana dakota serviceman life sustaining equipment please read carefully anyone requiring life sustaining equipment such as iron lungs chest respirators and rocking beds must have an emergency standby power supply life sustaining equipment includes any electrically operated support system such as tank type respirators iron lungs cuirass type respirators chest respirators intermittent positive pressure respirators hemodialysis equipment kidney machines mechanical nebulizers suction machines rocking beds apnea monitors or other similar equipment if you are a landlord with tenants using such equipment please advise them of the safety equipment requirement to have an emergency standby power supply montana dakota does everything possible to provide reliable service but because of weather mechanical failure and other circumstances beyond our control we cannot guarantee uninterrupted electric service downed power lines downed lines stay calm and stay away severe storms that visit our region from time to time can and do cause electrical outages whether the cause is a fallen tree limbs or lightning bolt the result is often the same downed electric lines if you see a fallen power line stay far away from it and warn others to stay away too call your electric utility company or the local police right away all downed power lines should be considered energized and dangerous never try to reposition a downed line with sticks poles or other items that are normally considered to be non conductors to some extent electrical current can travel through most materials even ones that are said to resist it if your car comes into contact with a power line stay inside and wait for help the vehicle s rubber tires help protect you from becoming a pathway for current to flow to the ground if you must leave your vehicle open the door and leap as far away from it as possible above all do not touch the vehicle and the ground at the same time remember after the storm storms can down power lines storm downed lines should always be considered dangerous so stay at least six feet away power lines draped over highway barriers or fences can energize them for great distances don t touch anything that s in contact with the wire if a power line falls on your car stay in your car you re safe as long as you do never try to cut fallen wires consider every fallen wire dangerous report it to authorities or call montana dakota dogs and meter readers she s good with kids but this dog s name is fanny she s not the smartest dog in town but she s company and always up for a good game of tug of fur it s not unusual for an otherwise easy going dog like fanny to get cranky once in a while and become a problem for our meter readers on an average day our meter readers visit about homes and businesses in our four state natural gas propane and electric service area and each day several will have painful skirmishes with a family dog some will require medical attention we understand that dogs like fanny are just being loyal and protecting their turf but that loyalty can cause you a lot of hassle if your dog blocks access to your gas or electric meter you might get an estimated bill if your pet bites one of our meter readers it could get impounded for medical tests a loose dog can get you into trouble with your city government not to mention your neighbors you can avoid a lot of inconvenience and at the same time help us serve you more efficiently by following a few simple tips try to be aware when we will be reading your meter and take special precautions around that time you can estimate when we will be at your house by just

general try to give us clear access to your meter s dogs are the most hazardous obstacles but not the only ones please avoid hanging ropes and garden hoses around the meter trim bushes shrubs and

metering systems encoder meters source of supply surface wells purchased storage capacity mg faq answers to your questions about the private water option what is a private water system a private water system is a water utility whose physical assets are owned by an individual or a group of individual shareholders private water systems are operated as tax paying corporate entities typically they have franchises granted by local municipalities since they enjoy local monopolies the rates and charges of private water systems are usually regulated by state commissions structurally private water systems are similar to investor owned electric utilities that serve major cities examples are consolidated electric new york city detroit edison and public service electric gas newark new jersey what are some examples of cities served by consumers water company areas served by consumers water systems mentor ohio massillon ohio shamokin pennsylvania sharon pennsylvania kankakee illinois danville illinois hudson new hampshire phillipsburg new jersey skowhegan maine camden maine and rockland maine are only a few examples what are some examples of privatization agreements with municipalities the most commonly known privatization agreement option is the purchase of an entire water system other options include single purpose investment where a city contracts with a private company that builds owns and services the plant public private partnership and specific contracts for operation maintenance billing and or other services how does a private water system finance its operation an investor owned water utility uses private capital to build and expand its system access to private capital eliminates the need to issue municipal bonds and reliance on limited public capital to maintain a reliable and safe water supply operational costs are covered by rates or fees for service why would a municipality be interested in selling to a private water company the advantages most commonly cited are that privatization provides cash to the community creates a new tax source takes advantage of economies of scale and provides access to capital municipalities also are interested in privatization as a means of alleviating the administrative burdens associated with operating a utility this allows them to have more time and resources to govern in addition privatizing a municipal water system shifts the risk of supplying drinking water from the municipality to the private water company what profits do communities realize from privatization customers of investor owned water systems receive dependable service and a safe clean supply of quality water and in many cases a reduction in their monthly water bills private water companies are constantly working with state and federal officials to ensure that all standards are maintained and that drinking water is clean and safe in addition privatization provides cash to the community it can turn a municipality s hidden equity into cash this is capital that can be put to use for other beneficial community needs or that can be invested for a long term revenue source also privatization may create a new source of tax revenue to support municipal services it offers a way for municipalities to utilize private sector resources and incentives to maintain upgrade or expand existing systems can private water systems provide lower operational costs because many private water systems are regionalized they have the ability to provide economies of scale and a high level of efficiency the purchase of a municipally owned water system by an investor owned water utility will most likely result in lower costs for materials employee benefits insurance and administration nationwide affiliations and mass purchasing power may result in saving as much as percent on the cost of items such as fire hydrants valves pipes and meters what are the operational benefits of privatization private and investor owned water systems provide municipalities suburban areas and other entities with the professionalism staff training and advanced technology required to operate water systems under today s stringent water quality standards private companies are well positioned to address proposed water quality regulations they often have better access to capital that s needed to construct newer improved facilities leaving the municipality s limited capital free for other purposes how do private water companies benefit local economies private water companies contribute to a community s economic base by providing quality water and dependable service which entices new businesses to the area the companies also help the local economy by paying state gross receipts property and other business taxes these taxes assist in the support of community services and facilities what does the epa think about privatization of water systems the epa supports the regionalization and consolidation of drinking water systems for the public sector as a means of dealing with the many financial and regulatory challenges it faces in fact u s epa administrator carol browner has stated in a letter to a nawc member company we find that communities throughout the nation are taking the lead in reinventing government and acknowledging the ability of private capital to enhance public investment the epa is committed to supporting these communities and allowing them flexibility in financing the infrastructure systems needed to achieve the environmental protection our citizens demand what is the outlook for privatization privatization is becoming an increasingly attractive and viable option for the public sector as it struggles with ways to deal with a growing number of financial and regulatory challenges the clinton administration s focus on reinventing government also will help contribute to increased interest in privatization options can private water companies help rural communities obtain access to water several private water companies are expanding to provide water to many rural areas throughout the country this benefits thousands of customers who previously did not have water service or who were receiving an unacceptable quality of water it also provides fire protection capabilities for many customers who previously had no connection to an adequate water supply additional sources of information american

<P>MPI de Mexico &#40;MPIM&#41; has overhauled and remanufactured more than 120 locomotives since July 1994 in its facilities in SLP.  With a new&#44; environmentally friendly paint shop &#40;shown above&#41; and a 32&#45;bay roundhouse&#44; the company has ample capacity to expand in Mexico.  It has become an integrated supplier to the railroad industry with help from its sister companies in the United States that manufacture and distribute more than 7000 locomotive parts.

<P>MPIM is structured to provide O&#38;M services to the railroad industry with the highest level of availability and reliability through its systematic maintenance program.

<P>Currently, MPIM overhauls and maintains EMD locomotives to the National Railways of Mexico under a ten year contract.  In addition&#44; MPIM provides service to the rolling stock, mainly focused on minor repairs&#44; however&#44; expansion to freight cars needing major repairs is coming.

<P>MPIM continues to focus on strengthening its organization and its core business while supporting an international growth strategy.  We strive&#44; on a daily basis&#44; to improve our production and operating efficiencies.

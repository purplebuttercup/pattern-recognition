<H3>KCS Supports Geismar Draft Environmental Statement</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>KANSAS CITY, Mo --July 16, 1997</P>

<P>The Kansas City Southern (&quot;KCS'') Railway Company expressed its
support of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (&quot;DEIS''), issued
by the federal Surface Transportation Board (&quot;STB''), on KCS's application
to construct and operate a new rail line through a sparsely populated area
of Ascension Parish, Louisiana. The DEIS, which was released on July 16,
found that the project will not have a significant impact on the environment
on, or adjacent to, the construction area.</P>

<P>The proposed nine-mile rail line would connect the three manufacturing
facilities of BASF Corp., Shell Chemical Co. and Borden Chemical and Plastics
with KCS's main line just north of the Town of Sorrento, Louisianaa. All
three facilities are located in Geismar, Louisiana.</P>

<P>&quot;We're pleased with the STB's report,'' stated KCS president and
chief executive officer, Michael R. Haverty. &quot;We commend the Board
and its staff for conducting a thorough study of the project and taking
into serious consideration all the questions and concerns of the interested
parties.''</P>

<P>&quot;The DEIS confirms what KCS believes about this project - it has
been well planned, it will support transportation safety in the region,
and it will introduce rail competition in the Geismar market,'' Haverty
continued. &quot;This project will provide an economic gain for Ascension
Parish and its citizens, as well as for the three manufacturing plants.''</P>

<P>The proposed new rail line will help alleviate projected increased highway
congestion in rapidly growing Ascension Parish. One rail car carries the
equivalent of 4-1/2 trucks. Moreover, rail transportation has been demonstrated
to be the safest mode for the movement of chemical and petroleum products.</P>

<P>KCS has stated that it will operate under a self-imposed low speed limit
of 25 miles per hour on the line through Ascension Parish. The new line
will utilize continuous welded rail that minimizes noise and will consist
of a new track structure and several new grade separations and crossings,
all of which are also designed to provide for a safe operation.</P>

<P>The public comment period on the DEIS will be 45 days. After comments
are considered by the STB, the federal agency will release a Final Environmental
Impact Statement (&quot;FEIS'').</P>

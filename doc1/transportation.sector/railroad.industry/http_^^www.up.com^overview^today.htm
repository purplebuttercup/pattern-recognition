Since its inception, Union Pacific has been a company whose activities have always been
associated with
the land - first as a key transportation link spanning the West, later as a developer and guardian of
its
natural resources. The strategic planning and investment decisions of the modern Union Pacific
Corporation
stem from this heritage. The corporation concentrates on businesses that it knows, using the
specialized
knowledge acquired over the years in fields of endeavor critical to the American economy and the
nation's
future.

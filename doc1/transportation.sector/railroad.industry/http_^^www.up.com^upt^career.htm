The Hiring Process
</h3>
</a>
Union Pacific Technologies interviews candidates during our fall and spring 
recruiting seasons -- the majority from college campuses -- for jobs in information 
systems related positions. Candidates fill out employment applications, which request
information
on education/degree(s), grade point average, and related experience.
<br>
<br>
Those who make it through the initial technical review are invited for
an interview and location visit. From there, Human Department representatives
notify finalists for the positions. It is the policy and practice of Union Pacific Technologies to
provide a work environment free from discrimination.  This policy extends to all terms and
conditions of employment.

<H3>KCSI's Monello to Head Financial Services</H3>

<H3>Railroad Appoints Robert Berry as CFO</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>KANSAS CITY, Mo.--July 1, 1997--As part of its strategic focus to build
further long-term growth potential and value to shareholders, Kansas City
Southern Industries Inc. (NYSE:<CODE>KSU</CODE>) announced today that Joseph
D. Monello, a member of its senior management team, will assume responsibility
for KCSI's Financial Services Division in addition to his current position
as KCSI's chief financial officer.</P>

<P>The Financial Services Division, with over $63.5 billion of assets under
management, includes Janus Capital Corp., one of the world's leading mutual
funds, Berger Associates Inc., and KCSI's 41% ownership of DST Systems,
the primary processor of mutual fund transactions.</P>

<P>Landon H. Rowland, chairman and chief executive officer of KCSI said,
&quot;KSCI is building two very valuable franchise segments -- Financial
Services and Transportation. This appointment enables KCSI to have full-time
management leadership for both of its franchise areas.</P>

<P>&quot;Joe Monello, as chief financial officer of KCSI, has been integrally
involved in positioning our company for growth in both areas. He knows our
financial services businesses and his financial expertise will be particularly
important as we move forward with the growth of this segment of our asset
base,'' said Rowland.</P>

<P>&quot;Michael Haverty, who heads our transportation operation, is a proven
railroad executive who is focusing his efforts on growing the franchise
of the Kansas City Southern Railway through a series of strategic acquisitions
and alliances designed, among other things, to make the Kansas City Southern
the primary railroad in North America with respect to the NAFTA trade routes
linking the U.S. and Mexican industrial heartlands,'' said Rowland. &quot;This
expansion of management responsibilities is consistent with our announcement
earlier this year to segment our approach to our businesses and financial
reporting by franchise area.''</P>

<P>The Kansas City Southern Railway also reported that Robert H. Berry,
a highly experienced financial executive, has joined the railroad as its
chief financial officer.</P>

<P>Berry brings to KCS over 20 years of finance and treasury experience.
He has served since 1992 as vice president of finance for Nortel Communications
Systems, a telecommunications equipment manufacturer based in Princeton,
N.J. Prior to that, he worked for Northern Telecom for eight years where
he served as assistant vice president-human resources and as treasurer.</P>

<P>&quot;Bob Berry's extensive business experience will be valuable as the
KCS develops its strategies for the next century,'' said Mike Haverty, KCS
president and chief executive officer. &quot;Bob has demonstrated sound,
yet creative skills, in developing and implementing financial and business
planning strategies. As KCS shapes its future as the NAFTA Railway, the
railroad will benefit from his unique qualifications and expertise.''</P>

<P>Berry earned his bachelor's degree in accounting from Boston College
and his masters degree in Business Administration from Province College
in Providence, R.I.</P>

<P>KCS is a Class I Railroad with operations in 11 central and southeastern
states. KCS is a wholly owned subsidiary of Kansas City Southern Industries
Inc., a transportation and asset management company with its headquarters
in Kansas City, Mo.</P>

<P>In addition to its financial services businesses and the Kansas City
Southern Railway, KCSI, through its transportation segment, has among its
major investments interests in the Texas Mexican Railway and TFM, Mexico's
premier railroad.</P>

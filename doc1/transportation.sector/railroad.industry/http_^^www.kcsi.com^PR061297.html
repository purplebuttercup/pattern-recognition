<H2>Kansas City Southern Industries and Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana
announce bond financing for railroad in Mexico</H2>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Kansas City Southern Industries and Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana
have announced the bond financing for the Mexican Railroad, which comprises
a $400 million, two-tranche senior notes and senior discount debentures
offering to be used primarily for financing the purchase of 80 percent of
the shares of TFM.</P>

<P>TFM, which is 49 percent owned by KCSI, was the successful bidder in
the Mexican rail privatization process to operate a 50-year concession for
the Northeast Rail Lines, which carry more than 40 percent of the total
freight revenue in Mexico and comprise the most actively traveled rail corridor
in Mexico. The Northeast Rail Lines also provide access to the United States
through Nuevo Laredo, the largest rail freight exchange point between Mexico
and the United States, where approximately 50 percent of all rail traffic,
based on revenue, crosses the border.</P>

<P>The $150 million, 10.25 percent senior notes due June 15, 2007, were
priced at 100 percent of par. The senior discount debentures, due June 15,
2009, represent approximately $250 million of proceeds and bear an interest
rate of 11.75 percent beginning June 15, 2002. The notes and debentures
were rated B+ by Standard Poor's and B2 by Moody's.</P>

<P>The securities have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933
and may not be offered or sold with the United States absent registration
or an available exemption from such registration requirements.</P>

<P>This announcement does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation
of offers to buy any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation
or sale of any security in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation
or sale would be unlawful.</P>

<P>TFM is also jointly owned by Transportacion Maritima Mexicana, S.A. de
C.V. (<CODE>NYSE</CODE>:<CODE><A HREF="http://quote.yahoo.com/quotes?symbols=tmm.a&detailed=t">TMM.A</A></CODE>

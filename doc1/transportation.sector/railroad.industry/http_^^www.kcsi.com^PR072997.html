<H2>Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. Announces 3-for-1 Stock Split and
20% Increase in Annual Dividends</H2>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>KANSAS CITY, Missouri, July 29, 1997</P>

<P>The board of directors of Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. (NYSE:KSU)
today authorized a 3-for-1 split effective in the form of a stock dividend
in the company's common stock as of July 29, 1997 to stockholders of record
as of Aug. 25, 1997, and payable on Sept. 16, 1997.</P>

<P>New certificates will be issued no later than Sept. 16, 1997. The board
also declared a cash dividend of 12 cents per share on the company's outstanding
common stock (on a pre-split basis) also payable on Sept. 16, 1997 to stockholders
of record as of Aug. 25, 1997.</P>

<P>Landon H. Rowland, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said,
&quot;The board has approved this 3-for-1 split and 20% increase in annual
dividend rate in reaction to the value that has been added to our two business
segments: Financial Asset Management and Transportation.''</P>

<P>&quot;Since the first of the year, our Kansas City Southern Railway has
acquired extremely valuable new holdings in both Mexico and the United States.
These acquisitions give the Transportation Segment a strategic north-south
rail corridor linking the U.S. and Mexican Industrial heartlands. As a result,
we now believe we are operating part of the most valuable rail property
for future growth in North America.''</P>

<P>&quot;Likewise, assets under management of our Financial Asset Management
Segment, which includes the Janus and Berger mutual funds, have grown from
49.9 billion to 69.7 billion since the beginning of the year. Mutual Funds
are the fastest growing investment and saving products for individual investors
in the world. As this trend becomes even more global, we see growing value
for our shareholders,'' said Rowland.</P>

<P>Kansas City Southern and Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana (``TFM'')
recently completed bond financing for their investment in the Northeast
Mexican Rail Line. TFM, a joint venture created between KCSI and Transportacion
Maritima Mexicana, S.A. de C.V. (NYSE:TMM - <FONT SIZE=-1>news</FONT>) now
operates a 50-year concession of the privatized Northeast Line of FNM, the
Mexican national railroad. TFM took over management of the Mexican railroad
on June 23, which followed a very successful financing of the acquisition
of KCS.</P>

<P>&quot;Over-subscription of the bond offering used to finance our acquisition
of TFM shows that the financial community understands what we've known since
we made our bid -- that this rail system has enormous future revenue growth
potential and is the crown jewel of the Mexican rail system,'' said Mike
Haverty, a director of KCSI and president of the Kansas City Southern Railway
Company. &quot;Major improvements in the operation of the Mexican railroad
have already been achieved and our customers tell us they like what they
see.''</P>

<P>&quot;Growth of our assets under management at Janus and Berger has been
beyond our expectations since the start of 1997,'' said Joseph Monello,
chief financial officer of KCSI, &quot;and this acceleration of growth is
bringing extraordinary value to our Financial Asset Management operations.
Given global trends, we expect this trend to continue and that is holding
great promise for our shareholders.''</P>

<P>Kansas City Southern Industries (as of June 30, 1997) has over 35,725,229
shares outstanding and after the split will have over 107,175,687 million
shares outstanding.</P>

<P>The board of directors also declared a regular quarterly dividend of
25 cents per share on the outstanding preferred stock. This dividend is
payable on Oct. 7, 1997 to preferred stockholders of record at the close
of business on Sept. 19, 1997.</P>

<H2>TFM Successfully Completes Financing For Its Purchase of Mexico's Key
Railroad Concession</H2>

<H3>Privatization of Mexico's Northeast Railroad to Capitalize on Opportunities
Created By NAFTA</H3>

<H3>TFM Assumes Management of Northeast Railroad At Historic Ceremony in
Monterrey</H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>MEXICO CITY, June 23 -- Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana (``TFM'')
announced today both the successful completion of the financing for its
purchase from the Mexican government of the Northeast Railroad concession,
Mexico's premier rail line, and the assumption of the management of the
railroad at a ceremony held in Monterrey.</P>

<P>Participating at the ceremony were Mexico's President Ernesto Zedillo
and other government officials as well as TFM's senior management and representatives
from TFM's two controlling shareholders, Transportacion Maritima Mexicana
(``TMM'') (NYSE:<CODE>TMM.A/TMM</CODE>) and Kansas City Southern Industries,
Inc. (``KCSI'') (<CODE>NYSE</CODE>:<CODE>KSU</CODE> ).</P>

<P>TFM now takes over the operation of the Northeast Railroad which is Mexico's
strategically most significant rail link with the U.S. in the NAFTA corridor.
Accordingly, the Northeast Railway, TFM, TMM and KCSI are all well positioned
to be major participants in and beneficiaries of the growing flow of goods
both in Mexico and under NAFTA. TMM is Latin America's largest integrated
transportation company and KCSI owns the Kansas City Southern Railway, a
class one U.S. rail carrier.</P>

<P>Mario Mohar, Chief Executive Officer of TFM, stated, ``We are very confident
about both the prospects for the Northeast Railroad as the NAFTA railroad
and our accomplishments in the short time since we were awarded the concession.
Specifically, we have established for the railroad a strong and sound financial
structure putting in place U.S. $807 million of equity capital and raising
U.S. $725 million of debt financing, which is comprised of U.S. $325 million
of bank debt and U.S. $400 million of high yield securities. In addition,
TFM has established bank revolving lines of credit of U.S. $150 million.
The purchase of the Northeast rail concession by TFM represents the largest
leveraged acquisition ever in Latin America, demonstrating investor confidence
in TFM's plan for the railroad and validating the potential of Mexico's
economic growth.</P>

<P>``Our excitement for the potential of the Northeast Railroad under TFM's
direction clearly is shared by the overwhelming response we received from
the financial marketplace in achieving our funding objectives. The recognition
of the Northeast Railroad's ability to grow as a world class railroad is
reflected by the international scope of our funding sources, institutions
from Latin America, the United States, Europe as well as other parts of
the world.</P>

<P>``Our business strategy is very precise and very achievable. The Northeast
Railroad is the NAFTA railroad. We assume management of a railroad which,
simply by definition of its location, without any of our planned substantial
improvements in marketing, service, equipment and technology, presently
transports over 40 percent of Mexico's rail cargo on 19 percent of Mexico's
rail track. It also is strategically located next to Mexico's primary North/South
truck lanes. Linking directly Mexico City and Monterrey as well as Guadalajara
through trackage rights, it also serves three of the four most important
ports in Mexico: Lazaro Cardenas, Veracruz and Tampico/Altamira. The Northeast
Railroad, under TFM's ownership, will connect in Laredo, Texas, to the Union
Pacific and the Texas-Mexican Railroad, which, in turn, links to the Kansas
City Southern Railway, BNSF, and to other major carriers throughout the
U.S. Approximately 60 percent of all rail traffic, based on revenue between
the U.S. and Mexico crosses the border at Laredo.</P>

<P>``With this key rail line now privatized and operated by TFM and with
the substantial capital investments that TFM will be making to upgrade the
line, we are confident that the Northeast Railroad will grow as a profitable
world class railroad and a leading transporter of goods in the NAFTA corridor.
We are the southern part of the NAFTA highway and will serve as a user-friendly
link with all North American railroads,'' Mr. Mohar said.</P>

<P>TFM, headquartered in Mexico City, is owned by TMM and by KCSI with the
Mexican government presently holding a limited voting rights ownership interest.</P>

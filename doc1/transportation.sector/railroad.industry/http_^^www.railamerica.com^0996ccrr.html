<P><B>BURLINGTON NORTHERN SANTA FE <BR>SELLS WASHINGTON RAIL LINE TO
RAILAMERICA, INC.</B></P>
<P><B>Ft. Worth, Texas and Boca Raton, FL--September 9, 1996--</B>The
Burlington Northern Santa Fe (NYSE: BNI) (&quot;BNSF&quot;) and RailAmerica,
Inc., (Nasdaq:Rail) today announced that BNSF has sold its Oroville line, a 131
mile rail line in north central Washington, to a RailAmerica, Inc. subsidiary,
Cascade and Columbia River Railroad Company (&quot;CCRR&quot;).  Financing was
provided by National Bank of Canada.</P>
<P>Effective today, CCRR commenced operations of the Oroville line, with
traffic on this line being interchanged at BNSF's Wenatchee yard.  CCRR has
established its general offices for the new railroad at Omak,Washington.</P>
<P>The line, which extends from Wenatchee to Oroville, Washington, was offered
for sale in April as part of BNSF's ongoing asset evaluation program.  BNSF is
considering the sale of approximately 4,000 miles of light-density lines over
the coming years as part of this program.  Since becoming a public company in
1992, RailAmerica has been actively pursuing the acquisition of rail lines
throughout the United States and Canada.</P>
<P>In commenting on the acquisition, Gary O. Marino, Chairman, President and
CEO of RailAmerica, said, &quot;This marks our first acquisition of a rail line
in the west and our first rail line purchase from BNSF.  We look forward to
expanding our relationship with BNSF, one of North America's leading rail
carriers, and we are looking forward to our partnership in providing rail
freight service to this important region of Washington State. We are confident
that we can significantly increase the traffic base on this line, which will
benefit the local regional economy, by expanding markets for products
originating on the CCRR with dependable, efficient long-haul services through
BNSF.&quot;</P>
<P>The CCRR marks the ninth railroad acquired and operated by RailAmerica, a
multi-modal transportation company headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida. 
Including CCRR, RailAmerica owns shortline railroads totaling more than 600
route miles in Michigan, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Indiana, Texas,
Minnesota, and now, Washington.  The Company also owns Kalyn/Siebert, Inc., a
specialty truck trailer manufacturer, and Steel City Carriers, Inc., a
Canadian-based motor carrier.  BNSF owns the largest rail network in the United
States, with more than 31,000 miles of line serving 27 states and two Canadian
provinces.</P>

<H2>Kansas City Southern Industries Completes Gateway Acquisition</H2>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<P>KANSAS CITY, Mo.--May 5, 1997--Kansas City Southern Industries, Inc.
(&quot;KCSI&quot;) that it had acquired Gateway Western and Eastern Railways
and had extended its rail network an additional 402 miles between Kansas
City, Missouri and East St. Louis, Illinois. </P>

<P>In January, KCSI petitioned the Surface Transportation Board (&quot;STB&quot;)
for approval to operate Gateway's lines. The STB's decision approving the
acquisition was issued on April 28 and became effective on May 5, 1997.</P>

<P>&quot;With the acquisition of Gateway Western, KCSI's 6000 mile rail
network extends from Kansas City, East St. Louis, Springfield, Illinois
and Meridian, Mississippi to Mexico City. Gateway's operations will be coordinated
with the other KCSI rail companies and affiliates--Kansas City Southern
Railway, Texas Mexican Railway and TFM--to comprise the NAFTA Railway,&quot;
said KCS President and Chief Executive Officer, Mike Haverty.</P>

<P>&quot;Gateway has established itself as an important transportation link
between Kansas City and East St. Louis,&quot; said Haverty. &quot;With its
strong management, qualified work force, strategic location on the Mississippi
River, and access to every major U.S. rail carrier, Gateway is a strong
addition to Kansas City Southern's NAFTA rail network.&quot;</P>

<P>In December 1996, KCSI, through a new affiliate called KCS Transportation
Company (&quot;KCSTC&quot;), acquired all of the outstanding shares of Gateway
stock. The stock was placed in an independent voting trust pending a decision
by the STB. Now that the STB has approved the acquisition, the voting trust
will be dissolved and the shares transferred to KCSTC.</P>

<P>Gateway Western, based in Fairview Heights, Illinois, has changed names
and ownership numerous times in its 150 year history. With a work force
of 281 employees, today it operates in Missouri and Illinois and serves
as a bridge carrier between East St. Louis and Kansas City. In 1996, Gateway
reported earnings of $5.1 million on revenues of $40.9 million.</P>

<P>Kansas City Southern Railway (&quot;KCSR&quot;) is a Class I Railroad
with operations in 11 central and southeastern states. KCSR is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of KCSI, a transportation and financial asset management company
with headquarters in Kansas City.<BR>

<IMG SRC="pixel.GIF" HSPACE=8>Since 1972&#44; Boise Locomotive has remanufactured and overhauled more than 1&#44;200 locomotives for North American railroads.  In recent years&#44; the company has expanded its capabilities to include manufacturing of new&#44; low&#45;horsepower switcher locomotives.  These state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art units offer greater fuel efficiency and unit reduction capabilities.  In addition&#44; Boise Locomotive provides daily maintenance on more than 500 locomotives in the U.S. and Mexico plus 3rd party lessors.

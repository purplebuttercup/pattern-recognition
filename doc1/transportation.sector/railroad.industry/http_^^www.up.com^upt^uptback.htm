<P>Union Pacific Technologies (UPT) is the information and
communications systems division of Union Pacific Corporation.
Established on May 28, 1987, UPT was created in recognition of the
increasing demand for development and implementation of new
information systems and services to support the Corporation's
operating companies. In its role as Chief Information Supplier for
Union Pacific Corporation, UPT develops
state-of-the-art systems for Union Pacific
Railroad, Overnite Transportation Company, Skyway Freight Systems,
and Commercial Clients.</P>

<H2><I>Union Pacific Data Centers</I></H2>

<P>UP has understood the value of centralized processing and control
since the late 1960's, a time when we had more raw, processing power
than NASA at the height of their Apollo space program. Union
Pacific's Data Center personnel have vast experience in providing
data center services to geographically dispersed customers in the
commercial sector and the rapidly expanding corporate family. The
Data Center management and support staff have provided quality
service over the past ten years to a large and diverse population of
users. The Union Pacific team that manages the Data Center facility
has a successful record of integrating large and complex
installations into the Data Center environment.</P>

<P>Union Pacific Railroad has two large data centers, one located in
St. Louis, Missouri, and one located in Omaha, Nebraska.</P>

<H4>The St. Louis data center includes:</H4>

<UL>
   <LI>Five IBM / IBM-Compatible Mainframes: one 3090/600J, two IBM
   9021/820, one HDS ex 100, one Amdahl 5995-4570.
   
   <LI>903 gigabytes of 3390 or 3390-compatible disk and 690
   gigabytes of 3380 or 3380-compatible disk. 389 gigabytes of EMC
   high performance disk.
   
   <LI>Tape equipment includes three Memorex-Telex 5400 ATL units,
   and 16, 3480 cartridge drives with IDRC, 14 Memorex 5480 tape
   drives; 2 3420 tape drives are also retained for media exchange
   with customers. There are over 60,000 cartridges in the St. Louis
   tape library.
   
   <LI>Three IBM 3745 Communications Controllers (2 live, 1 backup).
</UL>

<H4>The Omaha data center includes:</H4>

<UL>
   <LI>Four IBM / IBM-Compatible Mainframes: one IBM 3090-600J,one
   IBM 3090/600S and two Amdahl 5990-1400's.
   
   <LI>1058 gigabytes of 3380 and 3390 compatible disk. 136 gigabytes
   of EMC high performance disk.
   
   <LI>3 Memorex ATL's, 4 Memorex 5490 tape drives, 6 IBM 3480 tape
   drives, and 2 STC 3650 tape drives.
   
   <LI>Tandem equipment for running the ATCS application for UPRR,
   for which the St Louis Data Center Tandem acts as backup.
   
   <LI>Two IBM 3745 Communications Controllers (1 live, 1 backup).
</UL>

<P>The primary operating site for all EDI applications is the
St.Louis data center. The Omaha, Nebraska data center serves as the
disaster recovery site for all EDI applications, including the Tandem
communications hardware and the IBM 3090s. The Union Pacific
Corporation communications network links three major data centers
(the third is the Overnite Trucking Data Center in Richmond, VA) that
support over 15,000 remote terminal devices or workstations and over
5,000 remote printers on a 24 hour per day, 7 day a week basis.</P>

<H2><I>A Commitment to New Technology</I></H2>

<P>The Union Pacific family also has a strong belief in the benefits
of developing and/or migrating our applications to client/server
technology. In the last 4 years we've created hundreds of new
applications and deployed them on our national wide-area-network
which consists of the hardware listed above plus:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>73 UNIX and AIX servers
   
   <LI>98 OS/2 servers
   
   <LI>279 Novell servers
   
   <LI>26 Windows/NT servers
   
   <LI>100 Lotus Notes servers (9000 users)
   
   <LI>1 <I>Massively</I> Parallel Processor (16x4 NCR 5100M with a
   Teradata relational database)
   
   <LI>And numerous other servers dedicated to automated voice
   response, EDI, E-mail, image processing, project management/time
   collection, internet services, communications, and so on. Of
   course we'll be migrating our clients and servers to Windows NT in
   the near future.
</UL>

<P>To help our employees keep pace with this technology, our standard
issue workstation is currently a 166 Mhz Intel Pentium CPU with 32
megabytes of RAM, 2 gigabyte hard-drive, 8x CD-ROM and a 17 inch
monitor.

<H2><I>Data Center Support Services</I></H2>

<P>The Telecommunications Operations Center (TOC) is a centralized,
state-of-the-art telecommunications center. Highly trained network
specialists monitor all voice and data transmissions across the;
Union Pacific network, 24 hours a day. Advanced systems, such as
Graphic Network Monitoring, feed data signals into the center that
create the images which appear on large, wall-sized color screens.
These give the TOC a "big picture" of the Union Pacific system, and
allow the TOC specialists to swiftly react to service interruptions
or, frequently, to anticipate and prevent outages.</P>

<P>In addition, the TOC serves as a troubleshooting center, handling
300-500 trouble calls daily from Union Pacific employees and
customers all across the network. The TOC specialists either diagnose
and resolve the problems themselves or dispatch technical personnel
in the field. Then, the TOC specialists follow-up, touching base with
the technical personnel and customers making sure the service is
working satisfactorily.</P>

<P>Union Pacific's Online Systems Services (OSS) provides "help desk"
support to Union Pacific and commercial clients, 24 hours a day, 365
days a year. This group, comprised of 35 service representatives,
handle over 31,000 inbound calls per month. Expert systems technology
combined with video imaging provides the OSS representative with the
tools needed to handle problems, efficiently and quickly. The average
time a caller is in queue for an OSS representative is 25 seconds.
OSS uses an electronic logging system to track software problems that
was developed by personnel at UPT. The system allows for electronic
transfer of problem information and online searches for current
status information. The Software Problem Log system also has an
electronic documentation feature.</P>

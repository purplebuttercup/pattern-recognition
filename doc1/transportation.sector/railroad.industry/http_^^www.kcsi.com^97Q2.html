<H2>Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. Announces a 53% Improvement in
Second Quarter Earnings Per Share</H2>

<P>KANSAS CITY, Mo.--July 30, 1997--Kansas City Southern Industries Inc.
(&quot;KCSI'' or &quot;Company'') announces improved second quarter 1997
consolidated earnings of $31.8 million, or 29 cents per share (87 cents
per share pre-split) compared to $22.4 million, or 19 cents per share (57
cents per share pre-split) in second quarter 1996.</P>

<P>Second quarter earnings per share improved 53% year over year. Consolidated
earnings for the six months ending June 30, 1997, were $60.3 million, or
55 cents per share, vs. $42.3 million, or 35 cents per share, for the same
period in 1996. Consolidated revenues increased 22% and 20% for the three
and six months ending June 30, 1997, respectively, vs. the same periods
in 1996. All data has been restated to reflect the 3-for-1 stock split announced
by the board of directors on July 29, 1997.</P>

<P>Second quarter 1997 earnings of the Financial Asset Management (&quot;FAM'')
segment increased more than 39% over second quarter 1996 primarily due to
higher assets, revenues and operating margins. Revenue gains due to growth
in assets under management by Janus Capital Corp. (&quot;Janus'') and Berger
Associates Inc. (&quot;Berger'') exceeded the proportionate growth in costs
and expenses.</P>

<P>FAM earnings for the six months ending June 30, 1997 improved $16.9 million
over comparable 1996 as a result of a 4% higher FAM operating margin and
a 46% increase in revenues. Equity earnings from DST increased $4.9 million.</P>

<P>The Transportation segment reported a $0.5 million increase in second
quarter 1997 earnings after equity losses of $3.0 million recorded in connection
with the start-up of Grupo Transportacion Ferroviara Mexicana, S.A. de C.V.
(&quot;Grupo TFM''), the joint venture of KCSI and Transportacion Maritima
Mexicana which began commercial operation on June 23, 1997.</P>

<P>The substantial increase in 1997 earnings, exclusive of the Grupo TFM
start-up charges, is attributable to revenue increases from The Kansas City
Southern Railway Company (&quot;KCSR''), the inclusion of earnings from
Gateway Western Railway Company (&quot;Gateway Western''), and reduced interest
expense. The 1996 period also included certain allocated Holding Company
non-recurring operating expenses. Year to date 1997 Transportation earnings
improved 50 percent over the same period in 1996.</P>

<P>(a) All data has been restated to reflect the 3-for-1 stock split announced
by the board of directors on July 29, 1997, payable September 16 to shareholders
of record August 25, 1997.</P>

<P>Financial Asset Management</P>

<P>Second Quarter 1997:</P>

<P>FAM second quarter 1997 earnings were $31.5 million compared to $22.6
million reported in second quarter 1996. Revenues were $35.5 million higher
(46%) than the comparable period for 1996, primarily from a 43% increase
in average assets under management by Janus and Berger in second quarter
1997 compared to second quarter 1996.</P>

<P>Janus and Berger assets under management increased $10.4 billion during
second quarter 1997 as a result of net sales and market appreciation. Assets
under management totaled $63.6 billion at June 30, 1997 vs. $42.8 billion
at June 30, 1996.</P>

<P>While revenues for the quarter ending June 30, 1997 increased 46% over
the comparable prior year period, FAM operating expenses increased at a
lower proportionate rate. Accordingly, FAM's operating income increased
57% over second quarter 1996. The improved margin was primarily attributable
to utilization of state of the art technology and increased shareholder
balances.</P>

<P>Second quarter 1997 equity earnings from DST increased to $5.7 million
from $5.0 million in the comparable period of 1996, primarily due to improved
operating margins compared to second quarter 1996.</P>

<P>Year to Date:</P>

<P>Year to date 1997 FAM earnings totaled $57.0 million, improving 42% over
the same period in 1996. Revenues and operating income increased $68.6 and
$35.6 million, respectively, over comparable 1996 periods.</P>

<P>As of June 30, 1997, assets under management had increased $13.3 billion
since Dec. 31, 1996. Also, shareowner accounts numbered more than 2.8 million
as of June 30, 1997 (a 4% increase from December 31, 1996).</P>

<P>Year to date 1997 equity earnings from DST were $11.8 million vs. $6.9
million in 1996. 1996 amounts reflect the Company's share of DST's $10.2
million non-recurring charge in first quarter 1996 related to a former DST
equity affiliate, The Continuum Company, Inc. Exclusive of this item, DST's
1997 earnings reflect an increase in mutual fund, output processing and
subscriber management revenues, and higher operating margins compared to
1996.</P>

<P>TRANSPORTATION</P>

<P>Second Quarter 1997:</P>

<P>Transportation contributed $0.3 million to KCSI's second quarter 1997
earnings vs. a $0.2 million loss for the 1996 period. Exclusive of the losses
from the Company's investment in Grupo TFM, earnings for the quarter increased
$3.5 million compared to the same period in 1996.</P>

<P>Transportation revenues for second quarter 1997 increased 8% over the
1996 period, from $129.7 million to $139.9 million (includes Gateway Western
revenues). Higher KCSR revenues included a 34% increase in domestic and
export gains, a 5% increase in unit coal and a 6% increase in intermodal.
KCSR's increase in revenues was achieved from slightly lower carloadings
(down 1.5%), indicative of KCSR's focus on higher yield traffic. Continuing
efforts to hold cost increases proportional to revenue increases resulted
in revenues increasing at a greater rate than variable operating expenses
for the second quarter 1997.</P>

<P>The Company recorded $3.0 million in equity losses during second quarter
1997 associated with its investment in Grupo TFM. Of this total, $2.6 million
represented the Company's proportionate share of a one-time charge recorded
by Grupo TFM with respect to financing-related fees in connection with the
final installment payment of the TFM, S.A. de C.V. purchase price.</P>

<P>Transportation interest expense decreased 12% from second quarter 1996
due to the repayment of KCSR and Carland Inc. debt using proceeds from the
Southern Capital Corporation, LLC (&quot;Southern Capital'') transaction.
Interest of $7.4 million ($4.3 million in second quarter) related to the
indebtedness incurred in connection with the Company's investment in Grupo
TFM was capitalized through June 23, 1997 (the date Grupo TFM began commercial
operation of the Northeast Rail Lines).</P>

<P>Year to date 1997:</P>

<P>Transportation earnings for the six months ended June 30, 1997, increased
50% over the 1996 period, from $2.2 million to $3.3 million.</P>

<P>Transportation revenues increased 5%, from $260.6 million to $274.2 million,
primarily due to higher KCSR revenues and the addition of Gateway Western,
partially offset by the loss of revenue from Southern Leasing Corporation
(which was dissolved in October 1996).</P>

<P>KCSR's operating ratio, a common efficiency measurement among Class I
Railroads, was 87.9% for the first six months of 1997. The Southern Capital
Joint venture transaction, while increasing 1997 KCSR net income, also has
the effect of increasing KCSR's 1997 operating ratio from 86.1% to 87.9%
due to the shift of interest costs to lease expense. After factoring in
the effect of this shift in costs, the 1997 six-month operating ratio compared
favorably with the 1996 six-month ratio of 86.6%.</P>

<P>BUSINESS OUTLOOK</P>

<P>Landon H. Rowland, KCSI Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer,
said, &quot;The Company's second quarter earnings illustrate the operating
successes of each of our business divisions.</P>

<P>&quot;Continued growth in assets under management by Janus and Berger,
coupled with efficient operations, resulted in an increase in the Financial
Asset Management segment's contribution to consolidated earnings by 39%
over second quarter 1996 and 24% over first quarter 1997. Janus revenues
surpassed $100 million in an individual quarter for the first time in its
history.</P>

<P>&quot;The Transportation segment, and KCSR in particular, is beginning
to realize the benefits of operational improvements made during 1996, as
evidenced by the reduction in variable operating expenses as a percentage
of revenues during 1997. Grupo TFM's success in assuming the operations
of the Northeast Rail Lines in Mexico, together with the acquisition of
Gateway Western, have provided KCSR with opportunities to grow the railroad
business by offering distinctive advantages for the north-south movement
of commodities and containers.</P>

<P>&quot;Based on continuous improvement initiatives and an emphasis on
controlling variable costs, our two core business divisions are positioned
to provide unique opportunities for growth and success.''</P>

<P>The comments above include forward-looking statements, and KCSI's actual
operating results may differ from such statements. Readers need to refer
to KCSI's Current Report on Form 8-K dated Nov. 12, 1996, together with
the Current Report on Form 8-K/A dated June 3, 1997, for a discussion of
the factors that cause such differences.</P>

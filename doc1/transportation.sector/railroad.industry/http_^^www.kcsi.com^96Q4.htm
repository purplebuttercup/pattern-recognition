<P>NEWS RELEASE<BR CLEAR="ALL">KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN INDUSTRIES, INC.<BR
CLEAR="ALL">REPORTS STRONG FOURTH QUARTER AND 1996 EARNINGS</P>

<P>Kansas City, Missouri</P>

<P>Kansas City Southern Industries announced fourth quarter 1996 earnings
of $32.5 million ($0.87 per share) compared to $27.3 million ($0.66 per
share) in fourth quarter 1995, exclusive of the $144.6 million after-tax
gain as a result of the DST Systems, Inc. (NYSE: &quot;DST&quot;) stock
offering in November 1995. Earnings for the year ended December 31, 1996
were $150.9 million ($3.92 per share) versus $236.7 million ($5.41 per share)
in 1995. However, exclusive of non-recurring gains related to DST in both
years and 1995 unusual costs and expenses (as discussed below), 1996 earnings
of $2.68 per share were 28% higher than the $2.10 per share in 1995.</P>

<P>Fourth quarter 1996 earnings reflect continued growth in the earnings
of the Financial Asset Management segment, comprised of Janus Capital Corporation
(&quot;Janus&quot;) and Berger Associates, Inc. (&quot;Berger&quot;), as
a result of steady increases in assets under management (7% growth since
September 30, 1996). The Kansas City Southern Railway Company (&quot;KCSR&quot;)
segment also reported higher earnings as compared to fourth quarter 1995.
KCSR results were affected by various operating cost reductions, a non-recurring
fourth quarter 1996 gain on the sale of real estate, and higher fourth quarter
1995 labor costs for anticipated payments under collective bargaining agreements.
KCSI fourth quarter 1996 consolidated revenues increased to $220.9 million
from $198.0 million in comparable 1995, primarily due to a 47% revenue improvement
in the Financial Asset Management segment. Consolidated operating income
for the three months ended December 31, 1996 increased 38% because of lower
proportionate growth in Financial Asset Management operating expenses as
compared to revenues, and reduced operating expenses at KCSR.</P>

<P>As previously disclosed, in early December Transportacion Maritima Mexicana
(&quot;TMM&quot;) and KCSI were awarded a 50-year concession for Mexico's
highly valued Northeast Railway. On January 31,1997, TMM and KCSI announced
financing arranfements for the purchase, and made the initial payment.</P>

<P>Earnings comparisons for the year ended December 31, 1996 versus 1995
were affected by several significant factors:</P>

<P>1) 46% growth in assets under management since December 31, 1995 by the
Financial Asset Management businesses;</P>

<P>2) Higher 1996 consolidated operating income due to 1995 unusual costs
and expenses at KCSR and other Company subsidiaries, as previously reported,
which decreased 1995 consolidated earnings by $0.44 per share;</P>

<P>3) Increased 1996 equity earnings from DST, an approximate 41% owned
unconsolidated affiliate, due to a one time gain of approximately $47.7
million (after-tax), or $1.24 per share. This gain represents KCSI's proportionate
share of the gain recognized by DST in connection with the August 1, 1996
merger of The Continuum Company, Inc. ('Continuum'), formerly a DST unconsolidated
equity investment, with Computer Sciences Corporation in a tax-free share
exchange;</P>

<P>4) Reduced 1996 interest expense due to lower average debt balances,
largely because of lower year end 1995 debt balances as a result of the
repayment of indebtedness using the proceeds received in connection with
the DST stock offering.</P>

<P>5) the $144.6 million after-tax gain in 1995 resulting from the DST stock
offering, as discussed above.</P>

<P>Fourth quarter and year to date 1996 results also include non-cash acquisition
related intangible asset amortization expenses of $0.08 and $0.29 per share,
respectively, compared to $0.06 and $0.23 per share, respectively, in fourth
quarter and year to date 1995.</P>

<P><B>The Kansas City Southern Railway Company:</B></P>

<P>KCSR contributed $5.6 million to KCSI's fourth quarter 1996 earnings
versus $4.9 million in 1995. Fourth quarter 1996 revenues decreased 3% (to
$122.1 million) compared to 1995. Unit coal revenues decreased 9% from fourth
quarter 1995 due to the mix of traffic and fewer long hauls to an electric
generating plant served by KCSR. Additionally, general commodity revenues
were approximately $1.6 million (2%) lower than fourth quarter 1995, largely
due to a 7% reduction of revenues in the paper and forest products business
unit from volume declines. Revenue gains in the chemicals/petroleum, metal
products, food products and export grain business units were offset with
declines in the domestic grain and non-metallic minerals units. Fourth quarter
1996 intermodal revenues were slightly higher than prior year.</P>

<P>Although fourth quarter KCSR revenues were lower than comparable 1995,
operating income increased slightly, reflecting a $3.5 million decrease
in operating expenses. This decrease in operating expenses was due to cost
reduction measures during third quarter 1996, coupled with higher fourth
quarter 1995 expenses associated with accruals for labor agreements. Although
partially offset by higher end of year fuel costs, lower operating costs
were evident in salaries and wages, purchased services and car hire costs.
Fourth quarter 1996 earnings also include a one time pretax gain of $2.9
million from the sale of real estate.</P>

<P>For the twelve months ended December 31, 1996, KCSR contributed $17.1
million to KCSI's consolidated earnings, 50% higher than 1995. Revenues
of $492.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1996 were lower than 1995,
primarily due to trends similar to those encountered during the fourth quarter.
Despite lower 1996 revenues, operating income increased 11% to $74.1 million,
primarily due to unusual costs/expenses and accruals for labor agreements
in 1995. Exclusive of the 1995 unusual costs and expenses, operating income
for the twelve months ended December 31, 1996 would have been lower than
comparable 1995, mainly from reduced revenues and increased costs attributable
to adverse winter weather (in first quarter 1996) and from train derailment
expenses.</P>

<P>KCSR's operating ratio, a common efficiency measurement among Class I
Railroads, was 84.9% for fourth quarter 1996. The operating ratio for the
year ended December 31, 1996 was 84.5%, compared to 84.8% for the year ended
December 31, 1995. While increasing KCSR's operating ratio by approximately
1%, the Southern Capital Corporation LLC (&quot;Southern Capital&quot;)
joint venture transaction (completed in October 1996) resulted in overall
higher net income.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Financial Asset Management (Janus and Berger):</B></P>

<P>Financial Asset Management fourth quarter 1996 earnings of $20.3 million
increased 61% over fourth quarter 1995. Average assets under management
during fourth quarter 1996 were $16.0 billion higher than comparable 1995,
leading to a $30.6 million increase in revenues and a $14.2 million increase
in operating income over fourth quarter 1995. For the year ended December
31, 1996, Financial Asset Management contributed $69.1 million to KCSI consolidated
earnings compared to $43.8 million in 1995. Additionally, year to date 1996
revenues grew $90.1 million (38%) compared to prior year, contributing to
a 54% increase in operating income.</P>

<P>Assets under management by Janus and Berger increased 46% (to $50.3 billion)
during 1996 as a result of sales (net of redemptions) of $9.2 billion during
1996, coupled with market appreciation. Additionally, shareowner accounts
grew 8% (from December 31, 1995) to approximately 2.7 million accounts as
of year end 1996. Revenue improvements for fourth quarter and year to date
1996 were greater than the higher operating expenses associated with increased
business volumes, as well as higher Janus performance-based compensation
as a result of achieving improved results.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Corporate &amp; Other:</B></P>

<P>Corporate &amp; Other contributed $6.6 million to consolidated fourth
quarter 1996 earnings versus $154.4 million in fourth quarter 1995 ($9.8
million exclusive of the gain from the DST stock offering). For the year
ended December 31, 1996, Corporate &amp; Other earnings were $64.7 million
versus $181.5 million in 1995. 1996 earnings include $47.7 million associated
with the DST Continuum merger and 1995 earnings include the $144.6 million
after-tax gain resulting from the DST stock offering.</P>

<P>Equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates were lower in fourth quarter
1996 versus 1995 due to the absence of earnings from Midland Loan Services
and Midland Data Systems (collectively, &quot;Midland&quot;) in 1996. Midland
was sold in second quarter 1996.</P>

<P>Equity earnings for the year 1996 were significantly higher than 1995
due to the DST gain recorded in connection with the Continuum transaction.
Exclusive of this gain, 1996 equity earnings from DST declined as a result
of the Company's reduced DST ownership percentage (i.e., 1995 includes 100%
of DST earnings through October and 41% thereafter). Other factors affecting
DST earnings comparisons in 1996 versus 1995 include: i) the 1995 after-tax
gain of $4.7 million associated with DST's sale of its investment in Investors
Fiduciary Trust Company; ii) lower fourth quarter 1995 equity earnings due
to acquisition related expenses of DST's Continuum investment; and iii)
the first quarter 1996 effect of a $4.1 million non-recurring charge related
to Continuum. Exclusive of these items, DST's 1996 earnings increased as
a result of several factors, including increased mutual fund shareowner
accounts serviced and reduced 1996 interest costs.</P>

<P>Corporate &amp; Other earnings were also affected by higher KCSI Holding
Company expenses arising from the Company's activities related to the UP/SP
merger. These expenses totaled (after-tax) approximately $2.9 million ($0.08
per share) for the year ended December 31, 1996. Interest expense, however,
declined in 1996 versus 1995, primarily due to lower year end 1995 debt
balances as a result of the repayment of indebtedness using the proceeds
received in connection with the DST stock offering. Additionally, the completion
of the Southern Capital transaction in October 1996 allowed the Company
to repay indebtedness incurred throughout 1996 in connection with common
stock repurchases.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Business Outlook:</B></P>

<P>Landon H. Rowland, KCSI President and Chief Executive Officer, commented,
&quot;The Company's fourth quarter results confirm the recent trends in
both its KCSR and Financial Asset Management segments. Despite lower revenues
compared to fourth quarter 1995, KCSR earnings improved in fourth quarter
1996. Assets under management by our Financial Asset Management operations
increased more than $15 billion during 1996, due to favorable investment
performance, good reception to new products, and a growing investor base.
These trends have continued into early 1997.</P>

<P>1996 was a year of strategic achievement for our transportation operations.
The most important event was the successful bid with TMM, our partner in
Mexico, for Mexico's Northeast Railway, Ferrocarril del Noreste, the premier
rail line in that country. The award by the Surface Transportation Board
to the Tex-Mex of trackage rights between Beaumont and Corpus Christi, Texas
connects the KCS with the Tex-Mex. Our December 1996 acquisition of Gateway
Western Railway Company, currently awaiting Surface Transportation Board
approval, extends our rail line to East St. Louis and Springfield, Illinois.
Gateway's financial results will be included in the KCSR segment beginning
in 1997. With connections with all Class I carriers, our rail network makes
us the NAFTA Railroad. The spine of the economic integration of the North
American marketplace. The realization of these efforts have been and will
continue to be helped by our new venture with GATX, arising from the partnership
of our transportation financing group with GATX, a leader in transportation
equipment financing.&quot;</P>

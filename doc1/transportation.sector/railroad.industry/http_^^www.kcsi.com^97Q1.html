<H2>Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. announces record first quarter
1997 earnings</H2>

<P>KANSAS CITY, MO April 23, 1997<BR CLEAR="ALL">Kansas City Southern Industries
Inc. (&quot;KCSI&quot; or &quot;company&quot;) announced record first quarter
1997 earnings of $28.5 million (77 cents per share) compared to $19.9 million
(50 cents per share) in first quarter 1996.</P>

<P>These record earnings were largely due to improved operating margins.
Operating income increased 34% over first quarter 1996; revenues also improved
13% over 1996 or $228.1 million in first quarter 1997 vs. $201.3 million
in first quarter 1996.</P>

<P>First quarter 1997 earnings of the Financial Asset Management (&quot;FAM&quot;)
segment increased more than 45% over comparable 1996 attributable to a 37%
growth in assets under management since March 31, 1996, effective cost containment,
and increased equity earnings from DST Systems Inc. (&quot;DST&quot;).</P>

<P>The Transportation segment reported a 25% increase in first quarter 1997
earnings, primarily because of higher earnings from The Kansas City Southern
Railway Co. (&quot;KCSR&quot;) due to improved operations, lower interest
expense, increased equity earnings and a non-recurring gain on the sale
of track.</P>

<P>During first quarter 1997, the company repurchased more than 800,000
shares of its common stock. With these transactions, the company has repurchased
over 9 million of its common shares since January 1995, effectively completing
the 1995 repurchase program (for 8 million shares) and part of the 1996
program (for 3 million shares).</P>

<P>Effective Jan. 1, 1997, the company assigned the various components formerly
comprising the Corporate &amp; Other segment to either the Transportation
or FAM segment. Transportation includes KCSR, transportation-related affiliates,
and transportation-related Holding Company amounts. FAM consists of Janus
Capital Corp. (&quot;Janus&quot;), Berger Associates Inc. (&quot;Berger&quot;),
the company's approximate 41% investment in DST, and FAM-related Holding
Company amounts. Prior year's information has been restated to reflect the
new segment presentation.</P>

<P><B>Financial Asset Management</B></P>

<P>FAM first quarter 1997 earnings of $25.5 million exceeded the $17.5 million
reported in first quarter 1996. Revenues were $33.1 million higher than
comparable 1996, primarily from 45% higher average assets under management
by Janus and Berger in first quarter 1997 compared to first quarter 1996.
FAM operating income improved 64% to $41.6 million compared to first quarter
1996.</P>

<P>Janus and Berger assets under management increased $2.9 billion from
Dec. 31, 1996 (to $53.2 billion at March 31, 1997), as a result of net asset
sales of $3.3 billion during 1997, partially offset by market depreciation.
Shareowner accounts grew 3% from Dec. 31, 1996, to approximately 2.8 million
accounts as of March 31, 1997.</P>

<P>Revenues for the first quarter increased 47% over first quarter 1996,
and FAM costs and expenses increased at a lower proportionate rate, leading
to improved operating margins.</P>

<P>First quarter 1997 equity earnings from DST increased to $6.1 million
vs. $1.9 million in comparable 1996, primarily due to the company's share
of DST's $10.2 million non-recurring charge in first quarter 1996 related
to a former DST equity affiliate, The Continuum Co. Inc. Exclusive of this
item, DST's first quarter 1997 earnings reflect an increase in mutual funds,
output processing and subscriber management revenues and higher operating
margins compared to first quarter 1996.</P>

<P>Interest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 1997, increased over
1996 reflecting the company's common stock repurchases.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Transportation</B></P>

<P>Transportation increased its contribution to KCSI's earnings by 25%,
from $2.4 million in the first quarter of 1996 to $3.0 million for comparable
1997. Results were positively impacted by continued cost control and efficiency
measures at KCSR, as well as KCSR achieving during March the highest revenue
month since October 1995. The Railway experienced volume increases in chemicals,
paper, metal products and food products with coal showing the only significant
decrease due to four unplanned outages at utilities served by KCSR, and
weather problems at mines in the Powder River Basin originating the coal.</P>

<P>Kansas City Southern Railway, on a stand-alone basis, recorded net income
of $3.1 million exclusive of special items. This represents a 63% increase
over first quarter 1996. Including a one-time gain of $0.9 million on the
sale of the 104 miles of abandoned rail lines, net income was $4.0 million
after tax, or 110% above last year. These net income gains were achieved
in spite of handling nearly 6,000 fewer carloads of coal in 1997 vs. 1996
due to the unplanned outages and weather-related problems.</P>

<P>Revenue per carload increased by 2.4% for the first quarter of 1997 compared
to the 1996 period, indicative of a focus on higher yield business. Holding
Company and transportation-related affiliates' revenues decreased $4.0 million
primarily as a result of the dissolution of Southern Leasing Corp. (&quot;SLC&quot;)
in connection with the Southern Capital Corp. (&quot;Southern Capital&quot;)
joint venture formation in October 1996.</P>

<P>KCSR, exclusive of its subsidiary, Southern Group Inc., reported a 3%
decrease in operating expenses. The decrease was attributable to reductions
in salaries and wages, car hire and purchased services. KCSR's first quarter
employee count was 210 people less than comparable 1996, with labor fringes
as a percentage of revenue declining by 2.5% to 35.08%, which compares very
favorably to industry averages. Reduced KCSR operating costs were partially
offset by higher first quarter fuel costs and increased equipment lease
costs attributable to the Southern Capital transaction.</P>

<P>Equity earnings increased $0.5 million over first quarter 1996, reflecting
the inclusion of Southern Capital which became a KCSI investment in fourth
quarter 1996.</P>

<P>Interest expense decreased from first quarter 1996 as a result of the
repayment of debt associated with borrowings for the company's common stock
repurchases. Interest expense related to the indebtedness incurred in connection
with the company's investment in Transportacion Ferroviaria Mexicana S.
de R.L. de C.V. is being capitalized until the final installment of the
Ferrocarril del Noreste, S.A. de C.V. purchase price is made.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Business Outlook:</B></P>

<P>Landon H. Rowland, president and chief executive officer, commented:
&quot;The company's first-quarter results confirm the growth of our principal
businesses, while improving our operating margins. Both Janus and KCS Railway
were able to achieve this dual success. The Financial Asset Management group
built on its record 1996 earnings, increasing its contribution to consolidated
net income over first quarter 1996. The benefits of initiatives during the
second half of 1996 to stabilize or reduce costs under KCSR's improved service
structure were evident in first quarter 1997.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The company's efforts to grow its core businesses within reasonable
cost parameters, together with the activity with Transportacion Maritima
Mexicana to complete the purchase of Mexico's Northeast Railway, underscore
our emphasis on value-added growth.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;All of us at KCSI were saddened by the death of Mr. Paul H. Henson,
who served as chairman of our board of directors since May 1990. With Mr.
Henson's death on April 12, 1997, our company lost an outstanding individual
and leader -- influential, dynamic, forward-thinking and respected. His
contributions and leadership will continue to guide KCSI.&quot;</P>

<P>The comments above include forward-looking statements, and KCSI's actual
operating results may differ from these comments. Readers need to refer
to KCSI's Current Report on Form 8-K dated Nov. 12, 1996, for a discussion
of the factors that could cause such differences, which Form 8-K is hereby
incorporated by reference.</P>

         <P>GULFPORT, Miss...<B>Halter Marine</B> <B>Group</B>,
         Gulfport, Miss., <B>(AMEX:HLX)</B> Gulfport, Miss., has delivered
         the SEACOR VISION, a 225 foot, 12,280 BHP, anchor
         handling/towing supply (AH/TS) to SEACOR Marine Inc.,
         Houston, Tex. It is the first in a series of four vessels
         contracted by SEACOR Marine to Halter designed to meet
         requirements for deep water service in the Gulf of Mexico
         and the worldwide market. Built by <B>Halter Marine</B>
         <B>Inc.'s, Moss Point Marine</B> in Escatawpa, Miss.,  it is
         the 23rd <B>Halter</B> built offshore supply vessel to be
         operated by SEACOR.</P>
         
         <P>John Dane III, chairman, president and CEO of the
         <B>Halter Marine Group</B> said, "This is a truly
         contemporary international work boat with a modern anchor
         handling system, a thoughtful layout to meet the needs of
         improved safe working conditions and accommodations to
         provide crew comfort, advanced position/station keeping
         systems that include stern and bow thrusters, dynamic
         positioning and enlarged cargo capacities. It represents a
         leap forward from the 1980's Gulf of Mexico style vessels to
         an international design."</P>
         
         <P>Overall, the all-steel SEACOR VISION is 225 feet long,
         with a 52 foot beam and a 22 foot deep hull. Loaded draft is
         18.7 feet and light draft is 11.7 feet. Her double bottom
         hull, and other safety features, meet Safety of Life at Sea
         (SOLAS) requirements and the new U.S.C.G. subchapter "L"
         requirements.</P>
         
         <P>The 12,280 brake horsepower, the most powerful ever in a
         <B>Halter</B> commercial AH/TS, is produced by four General
         Motors EMD 16-645-E7B diesel engines driving through
         Reintjes compound reverse/reduction gears. The compound
         gears give the captain the flexibility to disengage two of
         the four engines for greater fuel economy when they are not
         needed, and the vessel's 1,600 Kw generators can be operated
         independently through clutches from the CP system, or in
         conjunction with the propulsion system to make efficient use
         of the available horsepower.</P>
         
         <P>Berg, 140 inch, four-blade controllable pitch propellers
         in Kort nozzles propel the vessel. Maneuverability is aided
         by two, 600 BHP, DC motor driven bowthrusters and one, 600
         BHP, DC sternthruster. The double plate rudder incorporates
         a palm for ease of removal.Anchor handling and towing is
         handled by a Smatco 116 EAW 660 double drum waterfall 850HP
         DC electric winch with 660,000 pounds of pull. Each drum can
         hold 7,900 feet of three inch wire rope. SEACOR VISION
         recorded a bollard pull of 158.6 metric tonnes during sea
         trials.</P>
         
         <P>Other towing and anchor handling equipment includes two
         retractable Triplex shark jaws chain stoppers each with a
         capacity of 350 tons, two retractable Triplex towing pins,
         an eight foot by 12 foot stern roller, two 45,000 lb.
         capacity tugger winches and two wire storage reels each with
         a capacity of 8000 feet of 3 1/4 inch wire rope.</P>
         
         <P>Additional deck equipment includes two 10,000 lb.
         capstans, an anchor windlass and a five ton capacity crane.

         long tons of cargo.</P>
         
         <P>Below decks she is able to carry 8,000 cubic feet of dry
         drilling mud in tanks that are built into machinery spaces,
         not in ballast tanks which is typical of many OSV's. There
         is also space below decks for 2,100 BBL of liquid drilling
         muds and large chain lockers are also located below decks.

         positioning system and her pilot house includes Berg
         electronic controls, Sailor VHF and SSB radios, Sperry
         radars and a Tokimee gyro and a Control General
         electro-hydraulic steering system, plus additional

         <P>In commenting on the design modifications and new systems
         in the vessel, Dane said, "SEACOR VISION is well-named; it
         was a SEACOR-Halter effort intended to look forward.
         SEACOR's marketing, operations, and engineering group have
         worked closely with the <B>Halter </B>staff in creating a
         vessel for the next century.</P>

         tug supply boats for other companies that are now owned or

         one tug and one line launch built by <B>Halter</B> yards for
         other companies.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">GULFPORT, Miss...<B>Halter Marine Group, Inc. (AMEX:HLX)</B>
reported net income for the three months ended September 30, 1997 of $7.8
million, or $.40 per share, on revenue of $151.2 million. Second quarter
1998 earnings doubled from the level achieved in the second quarter of 1997
when the Company had net income of $3.9 million, or $.22 per share on a
pro forma basis, on revenue of $94.5 million. For the six months ended September
30, 1997 the Company reported net income of $13.2 million, or $.69 per share
on revenue of $300.2 million, compared to net income of $7.2 million, or
$.40 per share on a pro forma basis, on revenue of $180.4 million for the
first six months of the Company's prior fiscal year. After adjusting for
the effect of the Company's recently announced three for two stock split,
net income per share would be $.27 and $.14 for the three month periods
ended September 30, 1997 and 1996 respectively, and $.46 and $.27 per share
for the six month periods ended September 30, 1997 and 1996 respectively.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">During the quarter ended September 30, 1997 the
Company lowered its estimated annual effective tax rate to approximately
30%, reflecting anticipated benefit of income tax credits arising from certain
of the Company's construction contracts. This change in effective tax rate
had the effect of increasing net income for the three month and six month
periods by $1.5 million, or $.08 per share.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">John Dane III, chairman, president and CEO said,
&quot;Our level of business activity remains strong. The positive performance
of this quarter continues the Company's record of achieving increased earnings
per share in each quarter that it has been public.&quot; Dane added, &quot;The
Company's revenue and income growth for the quarter and six months continue
to be positively impacted by the operations of <B>TDI-HALTER</B> which was acquired
in April 1997.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Dane continued, &quot;I am particularly encouraged
by the increase in the Company's gross profit margin to 14.4% during the
quarter compared to the gross profit margin of 12.5% achieved during the
Company's first quarter of fiscal 1998. This improvement reflects gains
in productivity and efficiency and overall improvements in market conditions.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Company also announced its backlog was a record
$607 million at September 30, 1997. This represents a 6% increase during
the second quarter of the current fiscal year, from $570 million at June
30, 1997, and a 33% increase during the twelve month period, from $457 million
at September 30, 1996. The energy related portion of the backlog increased
to $368 million and represents 61% of the Company's total backlog. <B>Halter's</B>
backlog at September 30, 1997 included 21 offshore support vessels, compared
to 18 at June 30, 1997. The Company's backlog also consisted of $166 million
of government related work, $52 million of commercial work, and $21 million
of other work.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In addition, the Company announced that its rig
subsidiary, <B>TDI-HALTER, Inc</B>. has signed a letter of intent with Diamond
Offshore (NYSE:DO) for the conversion of the <I>Polyconfidence</I> from
a quarters semisubmersible into a deepwater drilling unit. The shipyard
contract value is expected to exceed $50 million, and will be included in
the Company's backlog when the contract is signed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Halter</B> also recently announced the pending acquisition
of three companies that will form the basis of its new Engineered Products
Group. The companies, AmClyde Engineered Products, Inc., Utility Steel Fabrication,
Inc., and Fritz Culver, Inc., manufacture and market winches, cranes, mooring
systems, jacks, locking devices, windlasses, capstans, tuggers and other
related equipment used in the construction and modification of vessels and
drilling rigs. The acquisition of these three companies, which are expected
to close within 45 days, is consistent with <B>Halter's</B> previously announced
objective to pursue a vertical integration strategy as it pertains to some
of the more critically engineered components used in the production of rigs
and vessels.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Halter</B> also announced earlier this month that it
was re-opening its Panama City, Fla. shipyard which has been inactive since
it was acquired in 1993. Dane said, &quot;The decision to reopen this yard
reflects our confidence in the energy related markets. We intend to have
approximately 300 employees within 18 months at this facility.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Halter Marine Group, Inc.</B> includes 20 shipyards
in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida. The Company specializes in
the design, construction, conversion and repair of a wide variety of vessels
and mobile offshore rigs for commercial, government/military and pleasure
boat markets. Shipyards of the <B>Halter Marine Group</B> have built more than
2,000 vessels in the past 40 years.</FONT></P>

         <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Bludworth Bond's history dates to
         the 1870's when commercial sail boats plied the Gulf of
         Mexico and B. L. Bludworth lofted his first wooden boat near
         Rockport, Tex. A decade later, the yard was prospering and
         J. L. Bludworth had moved the business to Harbour Island,
         across Aransas Bay from the original Rockport site. In 1905
         he moved the operation to Galveston, and it was later moved
         to Houston. The Texas City yard was added in 1986. The
         company's name is derived from two grandsons of B. L.
         Bludworth, Harold Bludworth and L. M. Bond.</FONT></P>

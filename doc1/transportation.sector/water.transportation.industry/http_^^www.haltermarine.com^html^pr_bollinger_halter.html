         SHIPYARDS, INC. TO FORM JOINT VENTURE ON COAST GUARD
         REPLACEMENT PROJECT</B></CENTER></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
         
         <P><B>&nbsp;</B></P>
         
         <P><B>Halter Marine, Inc</B>. a subsidiary of <B>Halter
         Marine Group, Inc.</B> <B>(AMEX:HLX)</B> Gulfport, Miss. and
         Bollinger Shipyards, Inc. Lockport, La. have agreed in
         principle to form a joint venture to be named
         <B>Halter-Bollinger</B>, to respond to the anticipated
         request for proposal for the U. S. Coast Guard's Deepwater
         Capability Replacement Project. The Coast Guard program,
         expected to run into several billions of dollars over the
         next two decades, is being designed to replace or upgrade
         the Guard's aging fleet of ships, cutters, aircraft and
         other assets.</P>
         
         <P>The preliminary agreement was announced in a joint
         statement by John Dane III, and Boysie Bollinger, CEO's of
         <B>Halter</B> and Bollinger respectively. They said, "Our
         two companies have built a significant number of the U. S.
         Coast Guard's and the U. S. Navy's small to medium size
         ships in the last 12 years. Our shipyards, with built-in
         production flexibilities, specialize in the design and
         construction of vessels in the 100 foot to 400 foot range
         which meet Coast Guard requirements. This will be a
         significant shipbuilding program. Although we expect
         competition from other shipbuilders, we are optimistic
         because our companies are thoroughly experienced in dealing
         with stringent budgetary parameters of the Coast Guard. Our
         companies have proven records in designing and building high
         quality, mission capable vessels on a very cost effective
         basis that meet the Coast Guard's criteria."</P>
         
         <P>The Coast Guard is a multi-mission service that carries
         out economic, environmental, and humanitarian missions and
         is an integral part of national security. It saves lives and
         property, keeps shipping lanes open, preserves living marine
         resources, protects ports and waterways, and intercepts the
         flow of illegal drugs. On an "average" day, the Coast Guard:
         Conducts 142 search and rescue missions; saves 12 lives;
         seizes illegal drugs with a street value of more than $8.4
         million; interdicts 22 illegal aliens, and responds to 334
         oil or hazardous chemical spills. Coast Guard vessels also
         participate in defense operations and exercises in many of
         the world's oceans including the Atlantic, Pacific, Gulf of
         Mexico, Baltic, Mediterranean, and Black Seas and the
         Arabian Gulf.</P>
         
         <P>Both <B>Halter</B> and Bollinger are highly regarded for
         designing and building military, government and commercial
         vessels using sophisticated systems and technologies.</P>
         
         <P>The Coast Guard's improvement program is not yet fully
         defined. The organizational, design and production
         arrangements of the <B>Halter-Bollinger</B> joint venture
         will be geared to fit the Coast Guard's program as it
         develops, and will be subject to the execution of definitive
         agreements between the companies.</P>
         
         <P>If awarded the contract, the <B>Halter-Bollinger</B>
         joint venture will be able to utilize the resources of
         <B>Halter's</B> 19 shipyards in Texas, Louisiana,
         Mississippi and Florida and Bollinger's eight facilities in
         south Louisiana.</P>
         
         <P>Interested parties should contact Anil Raj, <B>Halter</B>
         senior vice-president, 601-896-0029, or Marc Stanley,
         Bollinger vice-president, 504-532-2554.</P>

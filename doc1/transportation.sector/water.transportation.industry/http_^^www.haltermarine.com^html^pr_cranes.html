				<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">GULFPORT, Miss... <B>Halter Marine Group, Inc.</B> (AMEX:HLX) announced today the completion of the acquisition
				of three companies that have formed the basis of its new Engineered
				Products Group. The companies: AmClyde Engineered Products, Inc.
				of St. Paul, Minnesota; Utility Steel Fabrication, Inc. of Slidell,
				Louisiana, and Fritz Culver, Inc. of Covington, Louisiana manufacture
				and market winches, cranes, mooring systems, jacks, locking devices,
				windlasses, capstans, tuggers and other related equipment used
				in the construction and modification of vessels and drilling rigs.</FONT></P>
				<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The combined purchase price for the companies is $60 million,
				of which approximately $30 million was paid in cash and the balance
				in <B>Halter</B> stock.</FONT></P>
				<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In making the announcement, <B>Halter's</B> Chairman, President and CEO, John Dane III, said, &quot;We are pleased
				that we were able to close these acquisitions quickly, and to

				products now offered by our Engineered Products Group to our existing
				base of rig and vessel customers.&quot;</FONT></P>
				<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">As previously announced, Dick Juelich, former president of AmClyde
				Engineered Products will become the president of the Engineered
				Products Group. <B>Halter</B> also announced that in order to respond to challenges presented
				by <B>Halter's</B> continuing growth and to ensure that sufficient resources are
				devoted to the effective integration by <B>Halter</B> of its newly acquired businesses, it had separated its internal
				accounting and banking functions from its external finance functions.
				In this regard, Keith L. Voigts, <B>Halter's</B> principal accounting officer will assume the additional title
				of Treasurer, and Rick S. Rees, the company's executive vice president
				will assume the title of chief financial officer.</FONT></P>

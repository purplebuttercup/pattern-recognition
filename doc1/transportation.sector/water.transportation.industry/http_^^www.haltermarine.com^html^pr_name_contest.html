         <P>&nbsp;</P>
         
         <P>MOSS POINT, Miss... The U. S. Navy and <B>Halter Marine,
         Inc.</B> a subsidiary of <B>Halter Marine</B> <B>Group,
         Inc.</B> <B>(AMEX:HLX)</B> Gulfport, Miss. celebrated the birth of
         a new ship here today with the ceremonial keel laying of
         T-AGS*64, a 329 foot oceanographic ship at the <B>Halter
         Moss Point</B> shipyard.</P>
         
         <P>In a traditional ceremony, four high ranking Navy career
         officers welded their initials into a plate of steel that
         will become an integral part of the ship's keel. They are:
         Vice Admiral James B. Perkins III, Commander, Military
         Sealift Command; Rear Admiral Paul E. Tobin Jr.,
         Oceanographer of the Navy; Rear Admiral Henry C. McKinney
         (retired), President and Chief Executive Officer, United
         States Navy Memorial Foundation, and Captain Jack M. Kennedy
         (retired), President of the Navy League of the United
         States.</P>
         
         <P>The ship has not yet been named because the Navy has made
         an unusual departure from its tradition of having Navy
         historians sending well-researched recommendations to the
         Secretary of the Navy, who chooses the ship's name.</P>
         
         <P>T-AGS 64 will be named as a result of a nationwide
         kindergarten through twelfth grade student competition to
         propose a name for the ship. The program is intended to
         broaden public awareness of the Navy and its oceanographic
         mission through the 1998 International Year of the Oceans,
         and <B>Halter's</B> role in designing and building the ship.
         </P>
         
         <P>The ship naming contest supported by numerous Navy
         affiliates, including the Navy League and the Navy Memorial
         Foundation, will begin during the first semester of the 1998
         school year (September through December 1997). Winners from
         each state will be competitively selected by mid-March 1998.
         A national level awards panel will then convene in
         Washington, DC to determine the top teams in each of the two
         age categories, kindergarten through sixth grade and seventh
         through twelfth grade.</P>
         
         <P>In May 1998, a representative group from each of the two
         winning teams will be invited to attend an awards reception
         and presentation in Washington. At that time the Secretary
         of the Navy will announce the overall winner and the name
         for the T-AGS 64. Representatives of the final winning team
         will be sponsored to attend the christening and launch of
         the newly named ship, which is scheduled for the summer
         1998.</P>
         
         <P>Students in public, private and home schools from the U.
         S., U. S. territories, overseas dependent schools, and
         Bureau of Indian Affairs schools are eligible to
         participate. Proposed names and project descriptions must be
         submitted to State Navy League offices by December 31, 1997.
         Interested parties should contact Mr. Patrick Dennis,
         202-762-0253 or Ms. Gail Cleere, 202-762-1045. Contest
         details and other related information is available on the
         worldwide web site:

         </P>
         
         <P>John Dane III, Chairman, President and CEO of <B>Halter
         Marine Group, Inc.</B> said, "We are delighted the Navy has
         taken this approach in the naming of its newest
         oceanographic ship being built here at Halter. I encourage
         the school age children of Halter<B> </B>employees, and all
         teachers, parents and students in Mississippi to participate
         in this endeavor. The winner, if a Mississippian, will bring
         added honor to the people of our state since ten of the
         Navy's 11 oceanographic research ships built since 1983,
         have been built by Halter Marine here in Mississippi."</P>
         
         <P>The Oceanographer of the Navy's fleet of survey ships
         criss-cross the world's oceans conducting surveys. Besides
         mapping the ocean floor to update nautical charts, these
         ships typically conduct oceanographic sampling of the
         physical properties of the water column as well as the
         composition of the ocean floor. They launch and recover
         instrument packages, do acoustic property measurements, and
         have the capability to process and analyze the data onboard
         with the latest computer technology.</P>
         
         <P>The T-AGS 60 class ships carry the latest in
         over-the-side sensors and sampling equipment including
         bathythermographs, bottom corers, and seismic equipment.
         Seventy-five percent of the oceans either have never been
         surveyed or were surveyed many years ago using crude
         instruments. Recent surveys and new technologies have
         revealed a world of bizarre features, such as underwater
         volcanic cones, enormous featureless abyssal plains, and
         deep canyons larger than anything seen on dry land. The new
         ship, equipped with the latest in oceanographic surveying
         equipment, will help the Navy's ships to operate safely
         above, on and below the surface of the ocean.</P>
         
         <P><B>Halter Marine</B> <B>Group, Inc.</B> includes 18
         shipyards in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida. The
         company specializes in the design, construction, conversion
         and repair of a wide variety of vessels and mobile offshore
         rigs for commercial, government and pleasure boat markets.
         Shipyards of <B>Halter Marine</B> have built more than 2000
         vessels in the past 40 years.</P>

HALTER MARINE GROUP AGREES TO ACQUIRE

LEADING DESIGNERS AND MANUFACTURERS OF CRANES, WINCHES AND MOORING

SYSTEMS </B>







         </CENTER></P></BLOCKQUOTE>







         







         <P>&nbsp;</P>







         







         











<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">GULFPORT, Miss... <B>Halter Marine Group, Inc. (AMEX:HLX)</B>

announced today the pending acquisition of three companies that will form

the basis of its new Engineered Products Group. The companies, AmClyde Engineered

Products, Inc. of St. Paul, Minnesota; Utility Steel Fabrication, Inc. of

Slidell, Louisiana; and Fritz Culver, Inc. of Covington, Louisiana manufacture

and market winches, cranes, mooring systems, jacks, locking devices, windlasses,

capstans, tuggers and other related equipment used in the construction and

modification of vessels and drilling rigs.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The transactions are subject to completing definitive

purchase agreements, and to the approval of <B>Halter's</B> Board of Directors.

The combined purchase price for the companies is approximately $55 million,

of which approximately $28 million will be paid in cash and the balance

in Halter stock.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In making the announcement, <B>Halter's</B> chairman,

president and CEO, John Dane III, said, &quot;The acquisition of these three

companies is consistent with our previously announced objective to pursue

a vertical integration strategy as it pertains to some of the more critically

engineered components used in the production of vessels and rigs. Due to

the current expansion of the energy industry in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere,

limited industry production capacity has extended deliveries and affected

pricing for some of these components.&quot;</FONT></P>



<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The acquisition of the business of AmClyde Engineered

Products, the worldwide leading designer of cranes and mooring systems,

and Utility Steel Fabrication, Inc., AmClyde's leading subcontractor for

cranes and winches, and Fritz Culver, Inc., a leading designer and manufacturer

of towing winches, windlasses, tuggers and related equipment, will allow

<B>Halter</B> to bring more of the manufacturing of critical components used in

building vessels and rigs under its control.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The combination of these companies will also allow

Halter to manufacture most of the components for the rig kits for the Zentech

R450 and R530 jackup drilling rigs. <B>TDI-HALTER, Inc.</B>, a subsidiary of <B>Halter</B>

specializing in rig construction and modification, holds the exclusive license

to the R450 and R530 designs, as well as the exclusive right to build and

sell the rig kits for those designs.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Halter</B> intends to increase the production capacity

of both Utility Steel Fabrication, Inc. and Fritz Culver, Inc. by making

available additional fabrication space and specialized manufacturing equipment

currently available in Halter's existing facilities.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">AmClyde has offices in St. Paul, New Orleans and

Houston, and employs approximately 60 engineers. Dick Juelich, president

of AmClyde will become president of the new Engineered Products Group of

Halter. Utility Steel's president and principal shareholder, Ed Pender,

and Fritz Culver, president and principal shareholder of Fritz Culver, Inc.

will continue with their respective companies and become part of the <B>Halter

Engineered Products Group</B>.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The combined companies if reported separately,

would have approximately $90 million in annual revenue. The impact on <B>Halter's</B>

revenue will be less, as intercompany sales will be eliminated in the reporting

of Halter's consolidated financial statements.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Halter Marine Group, Inc.</B> includes 20 shipyards

in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida. The company specializes in

the design, construction, conversion and repair of a wide variety of vessels

and mobile offshore rigs for energy, commercial, government/military and

pleasure boat markets. Shipyards of <B>Halter Marine Group</B> have built more

than 2,000 vessels in the past 40 years.</FONT></P>

<CENTER><H2>Avondale Facilities</H2></CENTER>

<B><BIG><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Avondale</FONT></BIG></B> is a diversified company engaged in the design and
construction of new ships, repair and conversion of all types of floating
equipment, industrial fabrication, and the warehousing of steel.  The
combined resources permit the fast completion of work and minimum time out
of service for repair and conversion projects.
<BR><BR>
The Main Yard of Avondale's Shipyards Division is located at mile 106.5-108
on the Mississippi River, just above the Huey P. Long Bridge, about twelve
miles upstream of New Orleans.  The Algiers Yard is located at mile 94 on
the Westbank of the Mississippi River, directly across from New Orleans.
<BR><BR>
Avondale's new-construction conceptual and detail engineering staffs are
available for the formulation of your repair and conversion programs, and
will be pleased to formulate conversion designs to your requirements upon
request.
<BR><BR>
Located at Avondale's Main Yard are an 81,000-ton drydock and a 20,000-ton
Panamax drydock.
<BR><BR>
Avondale's employment exceeds 5,000 employees.

<CENTER><H2>Drydocks</H2></CENTER>

<B><BIG><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Avondale's</FONT></BIG></B>
81,000-ton floating drydock is 900 feet long, 260 feet wide, and
78 feet to the top of the wing walls.  The clear width at the inside of
the wing walls is 220 feet to accommodate VLCC tankers and many
unique structures such as drill rigs.
<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="Drydock2.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" alt="Drydock" width=206 height=176>
The configuration of the dock and depth of water enable the company to accomodate virtually all ships that can navigate the
Mississippi River.
<BR><BR>
Depending upon the time of year, the air draft clearance under the Huey P.
Long Bridge, the lowest obstruction downriver of Avondale's Shipyards
Division, can vary between 133 feet and 153 feet.
<BR><BR>
The 81,000-ton drydock is served by two 50-ton gantry cranes located on the
dock, and by two gantry cranes of 225-ton and 160-ton capacity each, located
on the supporting wharf.  Avondale's 600-ton floating heavy lift barge is
available for unusually large or heavy lifts.  Electrical power for dock
operation is self-contained and provided by two 100 KW diesel generators. 
Gas freeing, supplementary shore power, and all other required water, steam,
and air are also available.
<BR><BR>
A second drydock, a 20,000-ton lifting capacity Panamax floating drydock, is
also available.  This smaller dock, which is 705.42 feet long and 118.8 feet
between wing walls, is serviced by two 25-ton cranes located on the wing
walls.  Additional crane service to this dock is available from two gantry
cranes of 50-ton capacity each, located on the wet dock, and the 600-ton
floating heavy lift barge.
<BR><BR>
The docks are particularly suitable for ship jumboizing by the addition of a
midbody section or the attachment of a new forebody to an existing stern
section.
<CENTER><H2>Repair Department</H2></CENTER>
<B><BIG><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Avondale</FONT></BIG></B> offers a full service Repair Department.
 In addition to voyage repairs and re-coating, the Repair Department can

tender conversion, modernization of quarters, upgrading of electronics,
compliance with pollution control, addition of thruster units, installations
of cranes for heavy lift ships, segregated ballast retrofits,
addition of inert gas systems, and other repair services.
<BR><BR>
All shafting work, rubber repairs, and repair to structural damage that
 occur can be performed quickly.

<B><BIG><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">The</FONT></BIG></B> Algiers Yard offers berthing facilities for top-side repairs to inland
and deep draft vessels.  There is 3,650 linear feet of wet dock serviced
from a concrete wharf by one 40-ton, two 35-ton, one 30-ton, and two 25-ton
Whirley cranes, and one 22-ton tower crane.  The depth of water at dockside
is 40 feet.  All of the necessary customer offices and shop facilities are

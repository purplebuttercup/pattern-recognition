<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Marten Transport, Ltd., is pleased to announce a holiday bonus program for new drivers.</B>
<BR>
<BR>
We recognize that many drivers are anxious to pursue a better opportunity, but worry about the financial difficulties, especially over the holiday season.  To help relieve that concern, Marten will pay a $250 bonus for new drivers starting with the company between December 1, 1997 and January 5, 1998.
<BR>
<BR>
This is in addition to our orientation pay program which provides you with $200 upon successful completion.  With the additional $250 your first check will now be for $450 - <B><U>before</B></U> you drive your first mile with us.  We already have one of the most attractive driver packages in the industry and we believe that our Holiday Bonus Program will recognize the drivers who are considering a move to a premier carrier, but are hesitating due to the time of year.
<BR>
<BR>
If you are ready to make the holidays happier with a move up to one of the Nation's leading specialized carriers, give us a call @ 800-395-3331.  Better yet, why not <A HREF="RequestApplication.html">apply</A> today.

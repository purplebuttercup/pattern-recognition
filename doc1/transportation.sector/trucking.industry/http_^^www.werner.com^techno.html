<P>Thanks in part to our innovative use of technology, Werner is a leader in
the transportation industry. We have earned the reputation of being a proactive
carrier because, rather than waiting for problems to occur, we prevent them from
happening. </P>
<P>We have implemented numerous  automated processes that help move a
customer's shipment from its origin to its final destination. Satellite
communication, load optimization, driver hours-of-service, and EDI (Electronic
Data Interchange) are just a few of the many advanced technologies that Werner
has capitalized on in recent years.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Using Technology</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>All our trucks are equipped with satellite communication capability from
<A HREF="http://www.qualcomm.com/">Qualcomm</A>. This technology enables us to
track (to within a quarter of a mile) and manage freight 24 hours a day.</P>
<P>Using Qualcomm data to display all truck locations on a map, our marketing
and operations staff are able to see where our trucks are at any time. We
regularly track our trucks on an hourly basis, and even more frequently when
needed.

<H3>The Equipment</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The core of our system is a number of AS/400s -- IBM mid-range computers. We
also have some RS/6000s that assist in &quot;number-crunching&quot; applications
such as Load Optimization, and Drop-and-Swap.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We use several HP/9000s with attached Jukeboxes for our imaging applications
and our information warehouse system. Several hundred  PCs are used throughout
the Company.  </P>
<P>We use <A HREF="http://www.novell.com/">Novell 3.12</A> over a token ring
network. The network has a fiber backbone with MAN and WAN capabilities.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

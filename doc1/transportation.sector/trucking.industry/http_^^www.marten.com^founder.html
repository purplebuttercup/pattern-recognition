Roger founded Marten Transport in 1946 at the age of 17, delivering milk and other dairy products.  His routes at that time were primarily in the Modena, Wisconsin, area.  In the 1950's he expanded his milk delivery routes, purchased and drove school buses, and hauled petroleum products with his first tractor-trailer.

Beginning in the 1960's, Roger focused on developing his interstate carrier business, serving customers in the Midwest and on the West Coast.  His first office building and terminal were built on the property that now is the headquarters of Marten Transport.

Before deregulation, Roger purchased routes throughout the Midwest and began hauling perishable products in refrigerated trailers.  It was during deregulation when Marten Transport grew from a small, regional carrier to one of today's leading national protective service transportation companies.  Marten now serves a number of Fortune 500 companies and employs more than 1,200 people.

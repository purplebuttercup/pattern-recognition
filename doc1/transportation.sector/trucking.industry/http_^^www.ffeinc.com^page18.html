<br>
</font><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>WELCOME!&nbsp;  We at the FFE Truckers&#39; Association are excited that you are considering contracting with FFE.&nbsp; We would like you to know about a few of the services the Truckers&#39; Association offers.&nbsp; You're sure to find them to be very helpful.<br>
<br>
The Truckers&#39; Association operates its own maintenance repair facility at Lancaster, Texas.&nbsp; Being a member entitles you to full use of this facility.&nbsp; When you buy parts from us, and have our mechanics install them, you pay no markup.&nbsp; Our labor is virtually unbeatable at only $32.00 per hour.<br>
<br>
We also have a grease and wash rack.&nbsp; Again, parts are sold at costs.&nbsp; The labor rate here is only $18.00 flatrate for each grease rack operation performed and an unbelievable $9.00 per wash rack operation.<br>
<br>
Assistance on the road is also available at any time by simply calling our shop.&nbsp; We can get you help anywhere, anytime and you can charge it on our account with appropriate approval.&nbsp; A tire purchase plan is also available.<br>
<br>
FFE Truckers&#39; Association has its own Truck and Trailer Physical Damage Loss Coverage Plan.&nbsp; Membership in the Truckers&#39; Association is required to have this&nbsp; excellent coverage opportunity.&nbsp; Our rates are usually at or below current outside insurance companies&#39; rates.<br>
<br>
As if that wasn&#39;t enough to get your attention, we also have a fuel island!&nbsp; Our prices are competitive.&nbsp; We&#39;ve installed high-speed fuel pumps and it&#39;s very convenient if you also need truck repairs.<br>
<br>
All of the above services (and&nbsp; more) will only cost you $26.00 per month.&nbsp; For an additional $16.00 per month, we&#39;ll handle some of your bookkeeping, too.<br>
<br>
Do you have trouble keeping up with all those taxes?&nbsp; Let us help.&nbsp; For only $20.00 per year, we will prepare your heavy vehicle road use tax return!&nbsp; The tax is $550.00 per year per truck paid in quarterly installments of $137.50 each.&nbsp; Just call us and we&#39;ll keep up with it for you.&nbsp; It&#39;s that easy.<br>
<br>
The Truckers&#39; Association rents space from FFE in the shop building on the east side of the Lancaster, Texas facility.&nbsp; Our office is upstairs at the end of the hall, also on the east side.&nbsp; Shop hours are 8 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. daily, seven days a week.<br>
<br>
We look forward to having you as a member of the Truckers&#39; Association family!</p></font>

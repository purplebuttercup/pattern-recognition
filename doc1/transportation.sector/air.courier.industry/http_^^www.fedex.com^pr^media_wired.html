FedEx is piloting the next phase of the Digital Revolution.  It's a
very big idea.  It's called logistics.</H3>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>By Todd Lappin</STRONG></FONT><BR> 
<BR>
It's just past midnight, and I'm hunched over in the lower
baggage hold of a Boeing 727 parked near the Federal Express package
sorting facility at Oakland International Airport. I'm in here with two
FedEx freight handlers, and a few feet above us, on the main deck, the
jet is loaded fore to aft with 28 tons of freight, all neatly sorted and
packed into air cargo containers that fit snugly within the arched
contours of the fuselage. But down in the underbelly, where the space is
too small for the containers to fit, we're loading freight the
old-fashioned way - by hand - and as fast as is humanly possible.
<P> The cargo door is swung wide open, and packages are piling up on
the baggage hold floor, where a merciless conveyor belt carries them up
from the tarmac below. My task is to jam all the boxes into the cargo
bay as tightly as I can, because they've got to get to Portland, Oregon.
Tonight. A few hours from now. Absolutely, positively. </P>
<P> The boxes
are pouring in like water from a fire hose. There are awkward crates of
Ford auto parts, a few PowerPCs, Samsung computer monitors, tall cartons
marked "Live Plants," poster tubes, a cooler of blood samples, and
countless small boxes and flat envelopes emblazoned with the
purple-and-orange FedEx logo. I'm slipping and sliding on the curved
aluminum walls of the 727's cargo hold and stacking the goods like
cinder blocks - heavy stuff on the bottom, bulky stuff on top, and
little parcels crammed into any space that remains. And still they keep
coming, one after the other, until the baggage compartment is almost
full. I'm getting squeezed out, and the whole scene starts to feel like
a nightmarish game of <EM>Tetris</EM>, played out in cardboard and sweat.
</P>
<P> At moments like this, I'm tempted to fantasize that all the
dead-tree documents and cardboard-shielded manufactured goods stuffed
into the belly of this 727 are but the residual dross of a Second Wave
economic system charging headlong into its twilight years. In a
light-speed age of faxes, email, document imaging, FTP, and PGP
signatures, 500-mph jet freighters begin to look positively snail-like.
And by the same token, even a speed-addicted company such as Federal
Express can seem like a fossil-fueled dinosaur if you subscribe to the
theory that "being digital" means that bits, not atoms, will be the
bedrock of economic activity in the Information Age. </P>
<P> But think
again. As our communications media shift away from one-to-many
broadcasting and toward one-to-one interactive exchange,
precision-targeted distribution systems that can move physical objects
from Point A to Point B "just in time" are becoming more important than
ever. This trend, coupled with the deregulation of transportation
industries in the United States, has fueled an all-out effort by
American businesses to cut costs by improving logistics efficiency.
Already the results have been dramatic - billions of investment dollars
have been freed up for more productive uses. In 1980, for example, US
logistics spending comprised 17.2 percent of GDP, with inventory
investment consuming 9 percent. But by 1995, those figures had dropped
to 10.8 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively. According to Robert
Delaney of Cass Information Systems, "In order to survive, shipping
carriers have had to become faster and more reliable. Those that
couldn't make the transition simply aren't around anymore." </P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the growth of mail-order retailing and QVC-style home
shopping in recent years has been a bonanza for package shippers,
helping to push US revenues in the industry from US$12.7 billion in 1989
to $21.8 billion in 1995. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. As
online shopping and Internet commerce become commonplace, analysts
predict that more and more consumers will shop from their desktops
instead of the mall. According to Kurt Salmon Associates Inc. of
Atlanta, such "nonstore retailing" accounts for roughly 15 percent of
worldwide consumer sales, which totaled $1.87 trillion in 1995. But by
2010, the firm estimates, this figure will increase to about 55 percent.
Meanwhile, a recent Forrester Research Inc. study predicts that
worldwide revenues from online retailing will rise from $518 million in
1996 to almost $7 billion by 2000, with as much as 75 percent of that
total coming from the sale of hard goods such as apparel, gifts, food,
entertainment products, and computer equipment. </P>
<P> The writing is
on the wall, and the biggest names in the package delivery business -
including FedEx's arch rival, United Parcel Service - are hustling to
the online retail bazaar. For years, FedEx and UPS have been going tit
for tat in a battle to offer customers more delivery options, at lower
cost, with greater convenience and reliability. But looking toward the
future, neither company is content to survive merely as a high-speed
alternative to the US Postal Service. Instead, both are gearing up to
become full-service logistics providers that specialize in orchestrating
the flow of goods <EM>and </EM>information between customers, retailers,
and suppliers. </P>
<P> Still, FedEx remains a few steps ahead of UPS in
cyberspace, in no small part because it has a more deeply ingrained
tradition of looking to information technology for strategic inspiration
and competitive advantage - a tradition that goes all the way back to
the days when Fred Smith founded Federal Express in the early 1970s.
Indeed, if FedEx has its way, it will soon meld itself into an
inseparable component of the global information infrastructure. The
objective: to make FedEx the official airline of the Internet. </P>
<P>
From street level, FedEx exists in the form of white delivery vans and
smiling couriers dressed in blue. Yet behind that pedestrian fa¡ade is a
company rooted in the world of information technology and distributed
networks. All those couriers are equipped with portable barcode scanners
that function as the primary interface between FedEx's physical network
of jets and vans, and its information network of computers, databases,
and operations management tools. </P>
<P> The intimacy of this connection
between the datasphere and the physical world is what enables FedEx to
accomplish its daily miracle of collecting, sorting, and delivering
millions of packages to millions of addresses around the globe
overnight. These days, FedEx executives don't describe their business as
a corporation, a shipping company, or even an airline. Instead, they
unselfconsciously proclaim that "FedEx is a network." When pressed, they
go on to explain that the FedEx network embraces two essential
components: a global network of planes and trucks used for moving
bundles of atoms, and an information network of digital technology that
specializes in moving streams of bits. FedEx's strength derives from the
fact that the company is a network amphibian - equally at home with the
task of switching packets of cardboard or packets of electronic data.
</P>
<P> Fred Smith, now FedEx's CEO, deserves much of the credit for
this. In business schools across the land, Smith has become something of
a cult celebrity, largely because of a story - oft-repeated in the case
study canon - that the Federal Express Corporation traces its roots to
one of his Yale University term papers, which outlined his vision of
creating a delivery company based on a hub-and-spoke model that would
offer overnight delivery service to a national market. </P>
<P> It's an
inspirational tale, but it plays fast and loose with a few key facts.
These days, Smith scoffs, "That term paper thing is just an exaggeration
that got started in the media and perpetuated itself." The truth of the
matter, he asserts, is that his famous Yale term paper had nothing to
with what he calls "the hocus-pocus of the integrated air-ground
system." Instead, Smith insists, it was an analysis of the relationship
between logistics and the information technology industry, circa the
late 1960s. </P>
<P> In the FedEx "genesis" paper, Smith observed that
any company that had recently replaced a roomful of clerks with a
brand-new IBM mainframe couldn't afford to have its mission-critical
computer system fail for an extended period. Yet, he noted, it was
impractical to keep hundreds of expensive spare parts on hand as
inventory. Connecting the dots, Smith arrived at the not entirely
obvious conclusion that advances in information technology would
stimulate demand for a totally new kind of logistics system - a system
that could replace physical inventories by moving packages of hardware
almost as fast as a computer moves packets of data. </P>
<P> That burning
bush insight enabled Smith to identify the market niche that the FedEx
overnight delivery system was created to serve several years later. But
even more important, it also reveals just how intimately the destiny of
FedEx has been linked to the future of the information technology
industry since the company's inception. </P>
<P> In 1973, Fred Smith
launched Federal Express from an abandoned military hangar tucked away
in a dark corner of Memphis International Airport in Tennessee. During
the company's early days, in classic entrepreneurial style, gung-ho
couriers delivered packages in family cars, pilots bought fuel for
company jets with personal credit cards, and sales reps called customers
from warehouse phone booths. The infrastructure was crude, but Smith was
keeping his eye on the digital horizon, telling his new employees that
FedEx's success would be built upon a bedrock of mobile computers,
package tracking systems, and sophisticated databases. "At the time,"
recalls one FedEx veteran, "a lot of it was pretty hard to imagine."
</P>
<P> Smith's high tech investments - coupled with a lavish marketing
effort - quickly paid off. Within 10 years FedEx had racked up $1
billion in revenues, thus becoming the first American company to reach
the billion-dollar mark in a decade without mergers or acquisitions. The
firm today has revenues of $10.3 billion, and <EM>FedEx </EM>has become a
generic verb meaning "get it there tomorrow morning." That fact alone
earns the company a special place in the annals of American product
marketing - right alongside other hall of famers like Coke, Kleenex,
Formica, Xerox, Thermos, and Jello. FedEx has become the largest express
delivery company in the world by riding the leading edge of two trends
that have revolutionized the shipping business since the late 1970s: the
deregulation of the airline and trucking industries in the US, and the
rise of information technology. These days, FedEx delivers 2.5 million
packages daily to 211 countries around the world. To accomplish this
nightly miracle, the company relies on a backbone of 37,000 vans and
trucks and 562 planes - a fleet whose size puts FedEx in the same league
as heavyweight airlines like Delta and United. </P>
<P> But to understand
how FedEx plans to harness this massive cargo infrastructure to the
Internet, I had to head down south, to Memphis - the place where it all
began.he motto on the sign I passed leaving Memphis International
Airport probably wasn't the first choice of the local tourism promotion
board. There's no hype about Elvis Presley's monument to pop culture
excess at Graceland. No mention of the honky-tonk blues bars clustered
along Beale Street. Not a peep about the Mud Island park and museum
perched near the bend where the Mississippi river veers westward.
Instead, the sign announces, "Welcome to Memphis - America's
Distribution Center." It's the kind of slogan that only a Chamber of
Commerce could possibly love. </P>
<P> Elvis might be the city's most
famous son, but these days, FedEx is king of Memphis. With 26,000 local
employees, it's the biggest employer in town. The city is home both to
FedEx's world headquarters and to its famous hub facility - a sprawling
logistical complex built on the site of the derelict hangar where the
company first got its start. Memphis is no longer the only hub in the
FedEx system; during the mid-1980s the company abandoned the mainframe
architecture of the hub-and-spoke system and evolved into a distributed
network of freight-processing nodes. (FedEx now operates sorting
facilities in Indianapolis, Newark, Anchorage, and Oakland, with
overseas facilities in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and the
Philippines.) Less than half of FedEx's daily shipping volume passes
through Memphis these days, but even now the sprawling SuperHub remains
the largest in the FedEx network. </P>
<P> Each night at 11, FedEx air
freighters begin descending from the Tennessee sky like jet-powered
carrier pigeons homing in from all corners of the globe. The freighters
return to earth in 90-second intervals, one after the other after the
other, until more than 130 of the birds are spread out over 475 acres of
tarmac. By one in the morning they're all parked wingtip to wingtip - a
shadowy flock of DC-10s, A-300s and A-310s, and 727s in idle repose with
freight doors swung open, hollow decks glowing brightly. Headlighted
luggage trains snake across the pavement at breakneck speeds, their
paths crisscrossing in a dance of near misses. The cargo trains haul
bedroom-sized containers between the planes and a 1.8
million-square-foot sorting facility, where orange sodium lights shine
down on a 171-mile-long Rube Goldberg labyrinth of ramps, slides,
barcode scanners, and high-speed conveyor belts. Roughly 1 million
packages pass through the SuperHub sorting facility each night,
supervised by an army of 8,900 anxious souls who shepherd each package
into the container that goes to the plane that flies to the truck that
drives to the van that takes it to the recipient. </P>
<P> There's an
eeriness to this nightly hive ritual at the SuperHub. With all the
uniformed hustling amid floodlit darkness, the place takes on a
clandestine edge, like the scene at some remote desert airstrip operated
by a James Bond supervillain, or at Area 51 during a UFO recovery - so
much hidden from sight, yet somehow taking place right under your nose.
</P>
<P> Not far from the SuperHub, FedEx's corporate headquarters are
equally well concealed. Stripped of the company logo in an effort to
elude job seekers, a half dozen or so anonymous office buildings
scattered along the southern edge of Memphis International Airport house
the FedEx management team. The decentralized arrangement effectively
breaks FedEx's organizational chart into a distributed architecture - a
few vice presidents here, a couple of project managers there - all held
together by networks of email bits and human atoms that bounce between
scattered corporate nodes throughout the workday. </P>
<P> Behind one of
these straitlaced corporate citadels, a low-slung building squats buried
under a vine-covered earthworks, shielded by walls of thick concrete.
Formally known as the Global Operations Center, it serves as a
subterranean command facility for the entire FedEx distribution and
delivery system. Employees call it "the Bunker." </P>
<P> The lighting in
the Bunker is subdued, and a hushed intensity crackles through the
climate-controlled air. On the walls, giant flat-panel projection
screens display real-time weather maps of the continental United States,
while workstations around the periphery stand equipped with banks of
computer terminals and heavy black telephones. A team in the back of the
room specializes in domestic operations, and another behind it focuses
on surface transportation. Up front is the international unit; a bevy of
flight crew dispatchers are positioned off to the left, and there's a
handful of meteorologists tucked off in a dark corner. </P>
<P> "It's
pretty quiet here now," explains Bunker manager Pete Gwaltney. "But come
midnight, the place will be a whole lot busier. At peak periods, we
operate in five-minute decision cycles. </P>
<P> "Gwaltney's job is to
keep the FedEx distribution network running smoothly despite the
inevitable grind of glitches and failures that plague any complex
mechanical system. But as he nonchalantly puts it, "This company spends
lots of money preparing for contingencies." </P>
<P> To demonstrate the
point, he explains how FedEx launches an empty jet freighter each night
from Portland, Oregon, bound for Memphis. The jet tracks a course that
brings it close to several FedEx terminal airports so that if one of the
jets parked on the ground suffers a sudden mechanical failure, the empty
freighter can swoop down and pick up the stricken plane's cargo. </P>
<P>
The image of that empty FedEx jet streaking through the night reminds me
of the old "doomsday" bombers that were kept aloft and on alert during
the Cold War. "Jeez," I remark. "It's like Strategic Air Command around
here." Gwaltney smiles, as if the same thought crossed his mind a long,
long time ago. "Actually," he says, "it's more like Strategic Freight
Command." </P>
<P> We walk over to the center of the room, where a large
computer sits alone on a white table - a digital oracle perched on a
Formica-topped altar. Positioned just behind the central command and
control workstation where Gwaltney sysops FedEx's global network, the
computer is part of an experimental weather forecasting system developed
by MIT and the FAA. The image on the screen shows a local radar picture
of the Memphis area crisscrossed with a series of red and green lines.
Gwaltney stares at the kaleidoscopic jumble like a fortune-teller
reading a crystal ball. Then he looks up, smirks confidently, and
proclaims, "It's gonna pour five minutes from now." </P>
<P> And sure
enough, a few minutes later I'm in the parking lot, getting into my car
as the first giant raindrops splatter across the windshield. </P>
<P>
Globetrotting jet cargo planes may have earned FedEx a reputation for
speed, but the company's information structure keeps it in motion. At
the core of FedEx's central nervous system is a proprietary online
network called Cosmos that tracks the status of every package flowing
through the FedEx distribution network - from the instant the shipment
is ordered until the moment it is delivered. Processing more than 45
million transactions each day, the Cosmos network helps FedEx achieve a
99 percent on-time delivery rate and allows the company to fine-tune its
shipping system by amassing reams of information about who is sending
what, where, and to whom. </P>
<P> It's a core tenet of FedEx gospel that
the data about each shipment is just as valuable as the shipment itself.
With the success of Cosmos, FedEx has leveraged its talent for
information management to spin off a subsidiary called FedEx Logistics,
specializing in managing inventory flows and worldwide distribution. For
nonstore retailers or product suppliers, these services are a dream come
true. Fashion retailer Laura Ashley, for example, signed a 10-year, $250
million contract with FedEx to handle all aspects of the company's
order-fulfillment and distribution operations. Not only does FedEx run
all of Laura Ashley's warehouses - taking care of everything from
inventory management to packing and shipping - but when mail-order
customers call Laura Ashley's service numbers, they unknowingly speak to
FedEx employees who cheerfully answer: "Laura Ashley - can we help you?"
</P>
<P> With so much to gain from turning paperwork into pixels - both
in terms of cost reduction and information dominance - FedEx has spent
more than a decade bringing its network right to its customers' front
door ... and beyond. Since 1984, high-volume customers have been given
free PowerShip systems - dedicated PCs that directly connect with the
Cosmos network - which "automate" the shipping process by making sure
the information about each shipment is digitized from the moment a
shipping order is placed. A few years later, in an effort to get out of
the mail room and onto the desktop, FedEx began giving away dial-up
software called FedEx Ship that transforms any modem-equipped Macintosh
or Wintel computer into a part-time Cosmos terminal that can process
shipping orders, arrange for courier pickups, track packages, and create
laser-printed air bills. Now, with nearly 100,000 PowerShip systems
installed and 440,000 customers using FedEx Ship software, 60 percent of
all FedEx shipping transactions are placed electronically, through
automated shipping systems. But figuring out a way to integrate that
remaining 40 percent into the network is a problem that has nagged the
company's online evangelists for years. </P>
<P> And then - as luck would
have it - along came the World Wide Web. </P>
<P> "The Internet answered
a lot of our prayers," admits FedEx's Michael Janes. "Ultimately, we
don't care if it's your network or ours. We just want the network to be
everywhere." </P>
<P> Janes, vice president of electronic commerce and
logistics marketing, is charged with the task of selling the world on
the idea that FedEx will be a major player in Internet commerce. And
judging by the way he's practically jumping across the conference table
to tell me about his plans, it's clear he's fired up about the
assignment. </P>
<P> "The Web advertising paradigm is like pounding nails
with a screwdriver," he says. "Most of the stuff on the Web is useless
brochureware. You're scrolling through an online catalog, and at the end
you find yourself staring at a toll-free phone number instead of an
order-placement window. Around here, we call that 'commerce
interruptus.'" He cracks a wry smile while the joke sinks in. </P>
<P>
"If a customer has to go offline to complete a transaction, then you're
not going to make the sale. Cheap, one-to-one marketing is what the Web
is all about. The next level is to make online commerce get real. Our
experience with our proprietary network is directly applicable to the
public at large. We want the Web to be a primary interface for working
with FedEx. We want to be the company that makes people feel comfortable
doing commerce on the Net." </P>
<P> Thus far, FedEx has been using its
now-famous Web site to field test this game plan. Since it was rolled
out in late 1994, <EM>www.fedex.com </EM>has been a darling of online
content critics simply because it is "a Web site that actually does
something." That might seem like a modest claim to fame, but these days,
it's no small accomplishment. At the FedEx site, compulsive cybernauts
track the status of their FedEx packages in real time without picking up
the phone or tying up an expensive customer service operator who would
otherwise have to provide the same information. </P>
<P> But the nifty
package tracking is really only a curtain-raiser - "the mule of our
technology base," as one manager described it. By keeping close tabs on
how customers use its Web site, FedEx has diligently collected and
analyzed heaps of customer feedback and usage data to understand how
Internet users conduct transactions on the Web. With that information in
hand, the company this summer added a new function to its site that
makes it possible to order a FedEx shipment from the Web. It's a real
world example of Internet commerce in action, but even more important,
it essentially completes the transformation of any Internet-connected
computer into a seamless extension of the Cosmos network. Whether this
means that FedEx is absorbing the Net or being absorbed by it is a
question that's open for interpretation. But the folks at FedEx don't
really care one way or another. From their point of view, the bottom
line is simple: You have been assimilated. Everything is proceeding
according to plan. </P>
<P> On the third floor of one of FedEx's unmarked
office buildings, just past a befuddling maze of burlap cubicles, Fred
Smith works from an unassuming office decorated with a dozen or so model
jet planes arrayed on dark wood bookshelves. Straight-talking,
energetic, and intensely competitive, at age 53 he remains FedEx's
foremost strategic visionary. With more than 124,000 employees
worldwide, his company is long past its entrepreneurial phase. Yet Smith
remains a hands-on manager, and now, more than a quarter-century after
he wrote the Yale paper that got everything started, the last pieces of
his information gambit are starting to fall into place. </P>
<P> "The way
to substitute information for mass is to make a distribution system
that's as good as a warehouse," Smith says with a slight Memphis drawl.
"If you think about it, a warehouse is nothing more than a place to put
something so you know you've got it. Well, I figured if we could provide
the same degree of assurance to people, electronically, that their stuff
is 'in the FedEx warehouse' - be it on one of our 500-mph planes or a
50-mph truck - then they would no longer need to have it in a
warehouse." </P>
<P> Smith is warming up. "Over the past twentysomething
years, apart from the medical revolution and the microprocessor
revolution, the most significant thing to happen to the world has been
the ability to take mass out of production," he says. "The
inventory-to-sales ratio of the whole industrial world has dropped like
a stone during the last two decades." </P>
<P> And where does the
Internet fit in? </P>
<P> Smith lights up: "The Internet is going to
accelerate the process. The Internet is going to make it very difficult
for anybody in a middleman position to stay in business. I cannot
imagine how you can sustain any kind of a price premium when you'll be
able to send an intelligent agent out to go price shopping from Bombay
to Boston. The same type of effect that Wal-Mart had in the retailing
sector - that's what the Internet is going to do to every business.
</P>
<P> "We're on the fulfillment end of all that. All we have to do is
execute very well and make sure the government stays out of the way.
Advanced communications are going to create the market. We'll facilitate
what the technology permits. When the telegraph came along there was a
corresponding development of the rail system. The telegraph created the
connections and the railroad allowed fulfillment. Well, today the
Internet creates the connections, and we provide the fulfillment."
</P>
<P> Smith's analogy is pretty neat, but it leaves a lot to the
imagination. To see how he is connecting the dots these days, you have
to head 1,500 miles southeast of Memphis, to Tempe, Arizona, where a
computer equipment direct marketer called Insight Direct Inc. operates a
warehouse in an industrial neighborhood not far from Arizona State
University. </P>
<P> At Insight, FedEx is beta-testing its new secret
weapon - a back-end electronic commerce software package for the Web
called BusinessLink. If FedEx's master plan is to play <EM>Invasion of
the Body Snatchers</EM> with the Internet, then BusinessLink will be the
seed-pod. Designed to integrate every component of the e-commerce
transactional chain into a unified network environment - from order
placement to billing and invoicing to inventory management to final
delivery of stuff right to your doorstep - FedEx wants to position
BusinessLink as a logistics tool that allows nonstore retailers to sell
on the Web with lower costs, greater product variety, and better
customer service. </P>
<P> All this makes Insight an ideal FedEx guinea
pig. Launched in 1988 with a $2,000 credit card advance and an ad in a
computer trade magazine, Insight Direct is a FedEx-style entrepreneurial
success story, having grown to $342 million in 1996 sales by
direct-marketing computer parts and peripherals at bargain-basement
prices. The discount formula worked great for a while, but as PCs have
become more of a commodity, Insight's competition has grown fierce.
These days, everyone from RadioShack to CompUSA is jumping on the direct
marketing bandwagon, and profit margins are brutally slim. To stay
afloat, Insight expanded its product offerings, moved into catalog
sales, and began targeting cash-rich business-to-business customers.
Carrying lots of products is a great way to stand out, but it can entail
fearsome risk. In the six-months-is-a-lifetime world of information
technology, you're screwed if you get stuck with a warehouse full of
expensive, unwanted inventory. </P>
<P> Enter precision logistics. For
companies like Insight, the way to offer lots of product variety while
avoiding the inventory ball and chain is by "drop-shipping" products
direct from the manufacturer to the consumer - therein bypassing
Insight's warehouse entirely. In the jargon of the business, such
logistical hocus-pocus is called "virtual warehousing," and basically,
it's a practical manifestation of Fred Smith's cherished notion of
"substituting information for mass." Nowadays, Insight drop-ships
whenever possible, integrating its order processing, labeling, and
package tracking systems with FedEx's data network - which in turn
connects both to Insight's customers and its suppliers - so that roughly
35 percent of the company's orders are drop-shipped. Meanwhile, as a
test pilot for FedEx's BusinessLink software, Insight is automating this
whole process by transporting it to the final frontier of direct
marketing - the World Wide Web. </P>
<P> "Most of our customers are
technical people, so they already know you can do secure transactions on
the Web," says Denny Chittick, Insight's 28-year-old vice president of
information systems. "But the coolest thing about the FedEx system is
that the whole process is transparent to the customer. They place an
order at our Web site, it gets transferred to our vendor, then FedEx
ships the product. A lot of the time, we never touch the actual
product." </P>
<P> Chittick breathes in deeply. </P>
<P> "All we do is sit
back and collect the money." </P>
<P> That's it. That's FedEx's
∏bervision of the future - a digital marketplace of cyberspace
superstores, operated by managers who need only worry about marketing,
customer service, and counting the cash as it rolls in. FedEx promises
to make all the pieces fit together and do all the heavy lifting in
terms of invoicing, inventory management, order fulfillment, and, of
course, product shipping. The payoff will come by pumping more packages
though FedEx's global freight network and by skimming a few percentage
points off the value of each transaction - in exchange, of course, for
providing the software and systems integration that makes it all happen.
</P>
<P> All in all, it's a pretty subtle plan, but FedEx is facing some
high-profile competition from companies with different ideas about how
to carve up the Internet commerce pie. Actra Business Systems, for
example, a newly formed joint venture between Netscape and GE
Information Services, also hopes to win the race to become the bedrock
platform for Internet commerce transactions. Targeted at
business-to-business customers, Actra is planning to transform the
Internet into a gateway for transactions using electronic document
interchange (EDI), a common e-commerce protocol used by banks and
businesses. Actra then plans to use EDI links to integrate order entry,
billing, and inventory management systems into the distribution network.
If all this sounds very similar to FedEx's strategy, it is. </P>
<P> But
then again, Actra doesn't have its own fleet of planes, trucks, and
couriers. Sabina Norton, a logistics specialist at McKinsey and Company,
thinks this could prove to be either an advantage or a liability. "FedEx
already has the assets in place to make it all happen," Norton says.
"Somehow, Actra will have to acquire a freight capability. That might
give them more flexibility to offer a wider range of services, but it
may also mean that the level of system integration won't be as close.
FedEx also has great name cachet. In consumer markets, that will
probably count for a lot, given how much people worry about electronic
security." </P>
<P> Actra may not have FedEx's cargo-hauling capacity or
its phenomenal name recognition, but FedEx's most obvious competitor,
UPS, does. After all, with 147,000 brown trucks roaming the planet,
UPS's fleet is even more ubiquitous than FedEx's, and it's been around a
hell of a lot longer. Since the company's founding in 1907, UPS has
spent much of this century building a rock-solid reputation as a
reliable - if somewhat staid - package delivery stalwart. But when FedEx
came along, UPS was forced to undergo a dramatic transformation. Since
entering the overnight delivery business in 1985, UPS has fought
head-to-head with FedEx, wielding a similar arsenal of jet airplanes and
network-linked information technology. And while FedEx retains a
commanding 59 percent of the overnight delivery market for letters and
envelopes that weigh 2 pounds or less, FedEx and UPS are locked in a
market-share battle for overnight delivery of packages that weigh 3 to
70 pounds. These days, it takes more than speed to stand out in the
crowd. Price and flexibility matter, too. Thus, FedEx and UPS now find
themselves in the curious position of poaching each other's traditional
domains - with FedEx offering a range of guaranteed delivery options at
a variety of price points, from "FedEx Priority Overnight" to "FedEx 2
Day Economy," while UPS has gone so far as to acquire SonicAir, an
Arizona-based shipper that specializes in same-day parcel deliveries
(when overnight just isn't fast enough), typically for $159 a pop.
</P>
<P> Simultaneously, UPS has also been building its digital
infrastructure - a process that didn't really get under way until the
late 1980s. The reason for the late start in the information game,
explains Frank Erbrick, senior vice president and chief information
officer, is that it took a long time for UPS to realize that the rules
of the package delivery game were changing - largely as a result of
competition from Federal Express. </P>
<P> "UPS was making a ton of
money," Erbrick recalls. "We're still making a ton of money, thank God,
but in the 1980s some people started saying that there's more to
delivering packages than moving a truck at 50 mph down the highway or
flying an airplane at 500 mph across the sky. At first we didn't believe
that. We didn't believe, for example, that our customers really wanted
to be able to do package tracking. We thought, Why the hell do they want
to do that, when 99 percent of our packages arrive on time? We thought
the best way to run this business was to have a monumentally efficient
operation." </P>
<P> Efficiency, in UPS's case, meant washing each of the
company's brown delivery trucks nightly to preserve its life span and
training couriers to board their trucks left foot first to keep physical
motions to an absolute minimum. Such meticulousness kept operational
costs down, but it did nothing to address the day-to-day requirements of
UPS customers who needed tracking information, automated shipping
systems, and the ability to redirect packages en route to their
destinations." </P>
<P> The industry changed, and we had to make a huge
transition," Erbrick says. "Well, when you're a company with 50,000
drivers, 100,000 vehicles, a few hundred airplanes, and, most of all, a
corporate culture that says efficiency is measured in time-motion units,
you're not received very well when you say you want to spend a couple of
million dollars on computers. UPS had become successful by being better
than anyone else at keeping costs low. Fortunately we realized that the
old strategy wasn't going to work. That's when we began our
technological evolution by taking control of the information all along
the line." </P>
<P> These days Erbrick commands a billion-dollar
technology budget and boasts that UPS's late start allowed the company
to create a state-of-the-art information network using the latest
cutting-edge technology. And much like FedEx's Fred Smith, he's
convinced that his company's future lies in cyberspace. "I want to
manage our customers' material from the point of its creation to the
point of its utilization," Erbrick proclaims. "That's what logistics is
all about. The Holy Grail of this business is to manage the virtual
inventory. That's the goal, and the company that can do that first is
going to be the one that prevails. The Internet, the intranet - these
are the vehicles of connectivity that will make it happen. We're in the
best position to put it all together." </P>
<P> Perhaps, but as UPS is
busy trying to transform its corporate culture, FedEx has hit the ground
running. "The fundamental difference between UPS and FedEx," says
Gregory Smith from the Colograph Group Inc. in Atlanta, "is that UPS is
a trucking company that's in the process of becoming an airline, while
FedEx is an airline that's becoming more like a trucking company.
They're moving rapidly from opposite directions toward each other.
Nobody beats UPS on the ground, and the company remains profitable by
keeping costs down. But FedEx is a stepchild of deregulation. It's more
nimble, and it does a great job of keeping a finger on the pulse of the
marketplace." </P>
<P> Out on the streets, the refrain is similar. On a
sunny day in San Francisco, I ask a UPS driver unloading packages from
the back of his van to tell me how the two shipping rivals stack up.
"UPS and FedEx are both great companies," he says diplomatically,
resting his elbows on a battered hand truck. "We're top dog on the
ground, but they rule the air. We both take customer service very
seriously. But a lot of the time, I've noticed that FedEx is coming up
with new ideas first. At our management meetings, the managers spend a
lot of time sitting around and talking about whatever FedEx is doing
now." </P>
<P> He pauses for a moment to lift a black-and-white Gateway
2000 box onto his hand truck.  "Sometimes I wish that we were the ones
introducing new ideas. Otherwise, it's going to get a lot harder for us
to compete down the road." </P>
<P> It's the end of the working day, and
Diane Gotelli and I are nursing a pitcher of beer at the Elko Station
Deli, a dusty strip-mall roadhouse around the corner from the local
FedEx station in Sunnyvale, California. Gotelli has been a FedEx courier
driver for about 10 years, and together we spent the day riding around
in her step-body delivery van, driving through Sunnyvale's cookie-cutter
subdivisions, dropping off and picking up packages, and cheerfully
talking about life, work, and the proper relationship between the two.
</P>
<P> The circuit took us to Symantec Corporation's world
headquarters, a Mervyn's clothing store, a branch of Sumitomo Bank
Capital Markets, the Castagnolo Dental Lab, an office of Fidelity
National Title, and a tiny start-up called LeeTech Software. We ate at
Boston Market, then visited Bollinger Travel Service, Charles Schwab,
the Strong Trading Company, the ranch-style homes of a few middle-aged
telecommuters, and so on - a healthy cross section of the Silicon Valley
economic landscape, where technology rules, the service sector thrives,
and time is always of the essence. </P>
<P> But now it's quitting time,
our pitcher is almost finished, and buckets of rain have started to fall
from the dark clouds hovering in the Santa Clara sky. I ask Gotelli what
it's all about - the constant running around, the craving for instant
gratification, and America's wholehearted embrace of an overnight
delivery service that has made Federal Express one of the greatest
corporate success stories in recent history. </P>
<P> Gotelli pauses to
admit she's never really considered the question before. Then she smiles
- as if all of a sudden, it starts to make sense. "Well, I think people
just put things off as long as possible," she says, drinking down her
last gulp of beer. "It's human nature to procrastinate, and FedEx is
great at serving that need."

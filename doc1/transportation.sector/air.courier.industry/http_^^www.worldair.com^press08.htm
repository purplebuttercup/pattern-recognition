			<P>WASHINGTON DULLES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, October 9, 1996 -- World Airways, Inc. (Nasdaq:WLDA) today announced
			that its board of directors has authorized a buyback of up to 1.0 million shares via open market repurchases.</P>
			<P>Commenting on the buyback, World Airways President and CEO Charles W. Pollard said: &quot;We believe a substantial
			buyback of shares represents an excellent investment for our shareholders based on our analysis of current and
			prospective market demand for our wet leasing business, the strength of our backlog, likely cash generation from
			operations, our limited capital expenditure needs, and the fact that our shares are trading at a very substantial
			discount to our closest comparable, Atlas Air (Nasdaq:ATLS).&quot;</P>
			<P>World announced last week that it anticipated earnings for the third quarter of 1996 of approximately $2.8-$3.0
			million, or approximately $.23-$.25 per share. Analysts' expectations had ranged from $.00-$.20 per share for the
			quarter.</P>
			<P>World Airways provides worldwide passenger and cargo air transportation under contracts with major international
			airlines, the U.S. Air Force and international tour operators. The carrier, which operates a fleet of MD-11 and
			DC10-30 aircraft, is owned 57% by WorldCorp (NYSE:WOA), 17% by MHS Berhad (KLSE:MHS), a Malaysian strategic investor,
			and 24% by public investors.</P>
			<P>&quot;Safe Harbor&quot; statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: This release contains
			forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the impact
			of competitive products, product demand and market acceptance risks, reliance on key strategic alliances, fluctuations
			in operating results and other risks detailed from time to time in the Company's periodic reports filed with the
			SEC (which reports are available from the Company upon request). These various risks and uncertainties may cause
			the Company's actual results in 1996 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any of the forward
			looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company in this release. The actual number of shares repurchased
			by the Company will depend upon several factors, including the amount of cash on hand at the Company and prevailing
			market prices for the Company's stock. Therefore, no assurances can be provided that the Company will actually
			repurchase all of the 1.0 million shares referenced in this release.</P>

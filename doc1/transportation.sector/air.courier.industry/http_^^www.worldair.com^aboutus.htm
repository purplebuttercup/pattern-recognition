			<P><B>WORLD AIRWAYS: SOARING INTO PROFITABILITY</B><BR>
			Half-Century-Old Airline Achieves Steady Growth in the Tumultuous Airline Industry</P>
			<P><IMG SRC="50color.jpg" WIDTH="220" HEIGHT="220" ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="50th ANNIVERSARY" BORDER="0"><BR>
			The <A HREF="http://worldair.bitwrench.com/magazine/worldhistory.htm">colorful history</A> of World Airways - an almost fifty-year-old airline with a diversified client base of charter, cargo,
			wet-lease, and government - has mirrored the evolution of the American airline industry in almost every way but
			one: World has shown steady growth and financial stability over the past few years.</P>
			<P>Launched on March 29, 1948, with a fleet of three &quot;<A HREF="aircraft.htm">flying boats</A>,&quot; World
			Airways was acquired in 1950 by Ed Daly, a Chicago boxer who purchased the airline with a $50,000 loan from a trucking
			company. Like the airline industry, which has long been beset by massive upheavals and chronic turmoil, World has
			had its dramatic ups and downs over the past half century. However, for some time, the airline has been financially
			stable and profitable - no small feat when compared to the dwindling revenues of many other large carriers in recent
			years.</P>
			<P>How has World Airways managed to maintain consistent growth - in an industry known for pricing madness and mammoth
			losses, endless fare wars, and how has World Airways experienced stability and success during a period that has
			seen massive layoffs and countless bankruptcies, and how has the company remained virtually unknown to all except
			its satisfied investors and customers?</P>
			<P>The answer lies in a remarkably consistent global strategy that has allowed World Airways to quietly evolve
			into its current status as one of the few airlines capable of serving most aspects of the air transportation industry
			- from charter to cargo, wet-lease and government operations. By maintaining a strategic focus on specific niche
			markets, World has succeeded in penetrating markets that can be more difficult for traditional carriers to service.
			And by forging strategic alliances with other airlines, World has built a worldwide reputation as a uniquely flexible,
			reliable air carrier offering an unparalleled commitment to safety and service.</P>

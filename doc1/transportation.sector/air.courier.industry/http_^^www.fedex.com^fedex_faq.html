<DT><STRONG><A NAME="wrongPackage">When I track my international package, I sometimes get information on a package going to a different location or one already delivered. Why?</A></STRONG>

<DD>Some tracking numbers in the FedEx system are recycled, and the <A
HREF="/track_it.html">Tracking Page</A> may display
information from another shipment, in addition to, or instead of yours. To address this concern FedEx has revised the Tracking Page to request an approximate ship date. FedEx customers with an account number can get even more accurate information using the <A HREF="https://www.fedex.com/track_it_adv.html">Advanced Tracking Page.</A> 

<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="statusException">What is a status exception code? </A></STRONG>

<DD>An exception occurs when a package is temporarily delayed while in transit. Every effort is made to deliver every package as soon as possible, so an exception does not necessarily denote a late shipment.
The status exception explains the most recent exception in the scan
activity section.

<P>

The term "PMX" refers to a p.m. exception, when a shipment is returned to a delivery station for the night because it was undeliverable during the courier's route. Such a delivery exception may occur because the package was incorrectly addressed, a recipient was unavailable, etc.
In many cases, delivery is re-attempted the next day.

<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="noAirbill">Can I track without an airbill?</A></STRONG>

<DD>In order to track your package, you will need to use the airbill tracking number, found above the bar code on the FedEx shipping label.
All FedEx shipments are assigned airbill numbers, so you should be able to contact the shipper to find the number

<P>

Airbill numbers are 10 digits long for U.S. domestic shipments
(123-4567-890) and 11 digits long for international (400-1234-5678). There are no letters in the tracking numbers.

<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="shipmentArrive">The Tracking Page doesn't seem to work. Could the problem be my Web browser?</A></STRONG>

<DD>The FedEx Home Page was constructed using current HTML standards. These standards are supported by most, but not all, WWW browsers. If you are a CompuServe user with a Mosaic browser, you may wish to try Netscape or a similar browser. CompuServe sysop suggests you GO PCFF to download Netscape.

<P>

CompuServe users may also want to try loading the new version of CompuServe WinCim 2.01, which has a new version of the Spry-Mosaic browser.

<P>

Some America Online users have had trouble because the default settings in version 2.5 of the AOL software include compressed graphics, which adversely affect how the FedEx web site is displayed.
You may want to go to Preferences in the Options menu and turn compression off. Should your problems persist, you may wish to contact AOL Technical Support.

<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="shipment">Can I use the Page to find out when my shipment will arrive?</A></STRONG>

<DD>Although the <A HREF="/track_it.html">Tracking Page</A>
can provide up-to-date tracking information, there is no way to predict the delivery time for a particular package. Plus, security concerns would prevent us from releasing the information.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="dropOff">Do you have a listing of drop-off locations on-line?
</A></STRONG>
<DD>Yes, you can now visit the <A HREF="/dropoff/">Dropoff Locations</A> page.
<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="ratesPosted">Are rates posted on the site? </A></STRONG>

<DD>Yes- the FedEx<FONT SIZE="-1">&reg;</FONT> Service Guide rates are now available under <A HREF="/cgi-bin/rate?entry=us.us">FedEx Rate Finder</A>.
<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="studentInfo">What is the best way for a student to get information on FedEx? </A></STRONG>


<DD>As FedEx does not have the resources to answer individual student questions, we have developed the FedEx Student Information Pack, with extensive information about Federal Express Corporation, including an annual report. To obtain one, please call (901)395-4555.

<P>

There is also a wealth of FedEx information on the <A
HREF="/index.html">FedEx Home Page</A>. Look under "<A HREF="/pr/">What's new at FedEx</A>" and
"<A HREF="facts_about.html">About FedEx</A>" for the latest press releases, corporate information, and more.

<P>

Also, you may be able to find the information by doing a key word search using Yahoo, Infoseek, or another WWW search engine.
Trade publications are another excellent source of FedEx information.

<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="jobOpenings">How can I learn about job openings at Federal Express?</A></STRONG>

<DD><A HREF="/employment/">FedEx Career Opportunities</A> offers a partial listing of positions at FedEx and an online resume form.  
For employment 
opportunities in Memphis, TN, please call the Memphis Recruitment Center 
at (901) 797-6830.
<P>
Information regarding college recruitment and internship opportunities 
is available through your college placement office.

<B>POSTAL CODE ROUTING by Airborne Express</B><BR>
In order to speed routing and improve accuracy in  international shipping estimates, Airborne implemented a new routing system for international deliveries to the top 15 destination countries.  Packages routed by city code now receive postal code designations similar to the U.S. Postal Service's ZIP code. Initially, Postal Code Routing will be available in:  Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Mexico, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand and The United Kingdom.  A total of 30 countries will be added to the system enabling Airborne to better access those markets currently receiving more than 80 percent of our international shipments.

This jet offers a spacious interior unmatched in the regional market, overhead bins that offer truly ample storage, wide seats, and a convenient handrail built into the overhead bin.  The RJ85 is expected to join the fleet in April 1997 and to go into service in June.  Initially the aircraft will serve short haul regional markets.  However, the RJ85 has several unique performance characteristics that will allow Mesaba and Northwest to take advantage of many new-market opportunities.  The high-performance characteristics of the RJ85 allow this aircraft to operate into airports that have unusually steep approaches (up to 6%) as well as airports that are located at higher altitudes.  Northwest Airlines has been very aggressive in marketing to skiers who fly to ski-resort destinations, and the addition of the RJ85 to the Mesaba fleet will allow Northwest to expand its presence to several new resort markets, as well as offering additional flights to existing destinations.</FONT></TABLE><BR><HR NOSHADE SIZE="2" ALIGN=RIGHT><BR><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD ALIGN=Right><A HREF="saab340.htm"><B><H1>Saab 340</H1></B></A><FONT SIZE="4">The Saab 340 is manufactured by Saab Scania AB in Linkoping, Sweden; over 420 Saab 340's are currently in service worldwide.

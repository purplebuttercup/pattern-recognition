<h4 align="center">REMARKS OF ROBERT L. CRANDALL<br>
CHAIRMAN AND CEO<br>
AMERICAN AIRLINES<br>
NATIONAL PRESS CLUB<br>
WASHINGTON, D.C.</h4>

<h4 align="center">November 13, 1997</h4>

<hr>

<p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I appreciate your
invitation to address this prestigious group, but will admit that
visiting Washington, D.C. always elicits mixed emotions.</p>

<p>While this is a great city, lots of people -- including myself
-- wish that we could spend more time running our businesses and
less time worrying about what folks here in Washington are
deciding for us.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, it's a pleasure to be here and to have an
opportunity to talk about the emerging debate about re-regulating
the domestic airline industry -- a subject I think everyone will
agree is important -- not just to American and other airlines --
but to the economy and the country as a whole.</p>

<p>The airline industry is an important part of our nation's
economic infrastructure. And as we all know, it is also the
subject of both fascination and controversy. Everybody flies, so
quite naturally, everybody has an opinion about what the airlines
should and should not do. While we welcome the advice, we often
think that our business is a bit like church: many attend, but
few understand.</p>

<p>In recent months, that misunderstanding -- about how the
airline marketplace works and about the industry's recent history
-- has generated an increasingly cacophonous debate about a
number of proposals which, if adopted, will amount to a fairly
substantive re-regulation of the domestic industry.</p>

<p>To put the issue in the proper context, we need to recall that
only twenty years ago, in the late 1970s, we were in the midst of
a great debate about whether commercial aviation should remain a
regulated industry or, alternatively, be deregulated.</p>

<p>Prior to 1978, for almost half a century, the airlines had
operated as a highly regulated quasi-utility, with each carrier
permitted to fly only explicitly authorized routes at prices
established by the civil aeronautics board, or cab. </p>

<p>In 1978, all that changed when congress passed the airline
deregulation act. While international aviation remains heavily
regulated, the airline deregulation act freed the domestic
carriers to fly where they chose, and to charge what they wished.
</p>

<p>The theory was that free-wheeling competition would lead to
more and better service at ever-lower fares. And that's exactly
what has happened. If there ever was a proving ground for the
teachings of Adam Smith, the airline industry of the last two
decades has been it.</p>

<p>By most economic measures, deregulation has been a resounding
success. But for the established carriers, it was -- at least in
its early years -- a disaster. The dinosaurs, as the academics of
deregulation characterized us, were badly equipped for a
deregulated environment. The route systems that had evolved under
regulation were uneconomic; the fleet choices that had been made
on the basis of those route systems were inappropriate; the labor
contracts which had evolved were inflexible; and the management
structures of the day were unresponsive.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, new competitors quickly emerged which
were able to employ lower cost labor, used planes, route
flexibility and lots of imagination to offer new services and
lower fares.</p>

<p>Not everybody realized what a threat deregulation represented
for the major carriers. And once the threats became apparent, no
government entity stepped in to help as they struggled to adjust
to the new era of unfettered competition. It was strictly sink or
swim -- and as you know, some famous names sank!</p>

<p>In the years since, we have learned that the three most
important factors in our business are price, price and price.
After that, schedule frequency, network breadth, consistent
service standards, distribution strength, consumer incentives,
cost effectiveness and marketing innovation all have a role to
play.</p>

<p>At American, we -- like other carriers -- have worked hard to
be responsive to those consumer messages. We have structured
large hubs to offer our customers many origin-destination
combinations, built alliances with foreign carriers to extend our
networks around the world, and scheduled lots of flights in the
markets most important to our core business customers.</p>

<p>We've also done lots of creative things like creating the
tremendously popular frequent flyer idea, crafting carefully
structured incentive programs for travel agents, and building the
world's largest on-line travel reservation system, which we call
SABRE.</p>

<p>Finally, we've done all we can to manage our costs.
Unfortunately, the by-products of our cost control efforts have
all too often been long and bitter labor disputes and customers
upset by things like smaller seats, fewer closets, and reduced
food service.</p>

<p>While our efforts have thus far sustained some of the
pre-deregulation carriers, the financial performance of American
and the rest of the industry remains distinctly marginal. Even in
1997 -- which may turn out to be the airlines' most profitable
year ever -- the industry's return on equity will lag well behind
that of the S&amp;P 500.</p>

<p>Although these are good times by our standards, no one who has
been in the airline business for long is ever very secure; the
best description of airline economics I know is the old saying
that the only sure way to make a small fortune in the airline
business is to start with a big one.</p>

<p>While the deregulated airline industry has been and remains
difficult, deregulation has benefited most consumers by providing
ever-more service at ever-lower prices. Despite what large-type
headlines sometimes proclaim, average airline fares remain a
bargain -- since 1990, for example, consumer prices in general
have risen twenty percent faster than average airline prices.</p>

<p>Despite the acknowledged overall success of deregulation, the
airline marketplace &#150; like most free markets &#150; has
spread its benefits unequally, and in less predictable ways, than
the theoreticians of deregulation imagined it would. For example,
when deregulation happened, there were many academics who
believed that the established carriers would operate Ritz Carlton
airplanes, that low-cost airlines would operate motel 6
airplanes, and that other competitors would operate in-between
airplanes -- all on the same routes.</p>

<p>The reality is that all types of customers want to go at every
hour of the day &#150; and carriers have found that the best way
to serve any given market is to offer variously priced products
on every flight.</p>

<p>That means, as I'm sure you know, that airlines do not charge
the same price for every seat. That's true because different
seats have different value. One of the many aspirations of every
airline executive is rubber airplanes -- which could be stretched
when used on Friday afternoon flights and shrunk for mid-week and
early morning flights. Unfortunately, even the geniuses at Boeing
haven't figured out a way to do that.</p>

<p>To deal with the problem of fixed-sized units, we and other
airlines vary the prices we charge on any given route based on
total demand, competition, and the different values that
different customers attach to time. We sell some seats on every
airplane at very low prices and some -- to people who decide they
need to go at the last minute -- at full retail. And in between,
we offer various products with different time values to
accommodate the needs of different customers.</p>

<p>The process of deciding exactly how many seats to sell at what
prices is called &quot;yield management,&quot; which we and other
established carriers have raised to an art form by investing
millions of dollars in people who understand how to devise the
statistical and arithmetic decision rules needed, and in the
computers capable of doing the extraordinarily complex
computations required.</p>

<p>We have also built large hub airports, which allow us to use
airplanes very productively. The hub and spoke system works
because it allows airlines to multiply the number of products
they offer. An airline which uses 25 airplanes to connect 25
point As to 25 point Bs will only serve 25 city-pairs, or
markets. But, by using the same 25 airplanes to fly from 25
places on one side of a hub to 25 places on the other side of the
hub -- an airline can provide transportation between 675
city-pairs.</p>

<p>In addition to all this, I think it's fair to say that the
theoreticians did not anticipate the magnitude of the labor cost
differences that exist between new-entrant and established
carriers. The airline business is fast-paced and interesting, and
there is no shortage of airline entrepreneurs &#150; nor is there
a shortage of people willing to work at low rates of pay, and
without restrictive work rules, for anyone who starts a new
airline.</p>

<p>At the established carriers like my own, on the other hand,
unions jealously guard the high wages, generous benefits and
restrictive work rules which are the by-product of more than 50
years of history. Since labor makes up the largest variable cost
in our business, the labor cost differences that exist between
new-entrant and established carriers mean that established
airlines will never be able to compete, on a pure cost basis,
with new-entrant carriers that offer simple services across
limited networks.</p>

<p>Our challenge &#150; and the challenge of those who run the
other established carriers &#150; is to provide sufficient added
value so that a respectable percentage of the public will
continue to choose to fly with us rather than our low-cost
competitors. It's no easy task!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some folks in Washington -- particularly at the
D.O.T. -- now seem inclined to launch a re-regulatory effort
designed to strip the established carriers of their right to use
the competitive weapons they have developed, and to establish
regulatory handicaps which favor low-cost, new-entrant carriers
who promise low fares, service to small cities, or some other
politically defined objective which the market has not satisfied.</p>

<p>These interventionist voices are calling for limits on which
markets the established carriers can serve, on how frequently we
may fly, and for restrictions on how much &#150; and even how
little &#150; we can charge in specific circumstances. There have
even been suggestions that some of our slots &#150; which are
take-off and landing rights at the four U.S. Airports which are
slot constrained &#150; Chicago O'Hare, Washington National,
LaGuardia, and Kennedy &#150; should be confiscated and
reallocated to new-entrant or foreign-flag airlines.</p>

<p>None of that sounds much like a free market, or a deregulated
industry, to me.</p>

<p>In defending intervention, our critics have made much of the
strength my own and other carriers have developed at our
principal hubs, and of the difficulty new-entrant carriers
encounter when they challenge a major airline in a hub city.</p>

<p>It is worth mentioning, I think, that while American has three
major hubs today &#150; in Dallas/Fort worth, Chicago, and Miami
&#150; we had additional hubs in Nashville; Raleigh-Durham; and
San Jose, California just a few years ago. After investing
hundreds of millions of dollars to build each of them, we found
&#150; for a variety of reasons &#150; that our offering was not
competitive. Because the market is unforgiving, we closed them,
took the necessary financial hit, and put our assets to use
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Our experiences in those cities were painful for us, and
costly for our shareholders &#150; but they were the consequences
of the marketplace at work.</p>

<p>In many other markets around the country, our inability to
match the fares offered by low-cost carriers has forced us to
withdraw. In those situations, the various tactics and strategies
we've developed have proved insufficient to combat the cost
advantage of our opponents.</p>

<p>In other markets, however, we have been able to add sufficient
value to sustain ourselves. Moreover, there are some markets
whose strategic value is so great that we cannot exit. While no
airline can win in every market, every airline's network includes
some markets in which it <u>must</u> win if it is to survive in
the long term. The imperative to defend those core markets means
that, when challenged, we will compete aggressively with whoever
challenges us.</p>

<p>Those who favor re-regulation of the industry have suggested
that it is unfair for large carriers to match the low fares
introduced by low-cost carriers, or to increase capacity in
markets where low-cost carriers are attempting to launch service.
Those who complain fail to recognize that an established airline
which rises to the challenge of a new-entrant is doing only what
any business in a free market must do &#150; seeking to increase
the attractiveness of its product.</p>

<p>One of the unique aspects of the airline business is that it
is one of the few in the world where increasing output is a
method of raising quality. Since our customers favor frequent
service, it is only natural that an incumbent carrier challenged
in a core market will match the newcomer's prices &#150; since
every consumer's first concern is price &#150; while
simultaneously increasing the number of flights it offers to
enhance the quality of its product offering.</p>

<p>Unhappily, a double standard is emerging: when a low-cost
carrier enters a market and lowers fares, it is applauded for
providing healthy competition. But when an established airline
chooses to defend a market by matching the lower fares, or
increasing capacity, or both, it is denounced as predatory.</p>

<p>That's a peculiar characterization in a marketplace where
matching prices and improving quality is normally considered
standard competitive behavior. Moreover, from a consumer
perspective, matching prices and increasing flight frequency
results in more service and lower fares &#150; which is exactly
what congress had in mind when it deregulated the industry 20
years ago.</p>

<p>The idea that the government should respond to these market
phenomena by tilting the playing field in favor of new-entrant
carriers strikes me as entirely inconsistent with the intent and
spirit of deregulation. It is also ironic that &#150; at a time
when our government is doing its best to convince countries
around the world to open their markets to more competition &#150;
there is growing ambivalence in the united states about whether a
free market is appropriate for the domestic airline industry.</p>

<p>There is no disputing the fact that competition &#150;
particularly in our business &#150; can get messy. To use a
slightly twisted sports metaphor, we often say that life in the
airline business is a bit like Dennis Rodman's hair. On any given
day, you're not sure what you're going to see &#150; and most of
the time, what you see ain't very pretty.</p>

<p>Over the years, many of the things we've had to do to remain
competitive haven't been very pretty either. We've closed hubs,
abandoned markets, suffered through labor disputes, restructured
our network, modified our product, re-engineered our work
processes, endured fare wars, and changed our game plan more
times than I care to count.</p>

<p>Competition is messy, and it's hard. And by its very
definition, it creates winners and losers. The good news is that
if we all play the same game &#150; by the same rules &#150; then
the customer gets to decide who wins. And that's what business is
all about.</p>

<p>Thanks very much for having me here today &#150; it's been my
pleasure to be with you. Since there's been some time set aside
for a Q&amp;A, I'll be glad to answer whatever questions about
this crazy business you might have.</p>

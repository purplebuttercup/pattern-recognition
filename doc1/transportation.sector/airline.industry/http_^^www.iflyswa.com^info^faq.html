        Secure Commerce Server to protect your credit card
        information. The Netscape Secure Commerce Server works
        with most browsers. (A browser equivalent to Netscape
        Navigator 1.22 or greater is necessary. Please see the
        next paragraph for more details.) It encrypts information
        and keeps the data private and confidential between you
        and Southwest Airlines. This technology makes it safe to
        transmit your credit card number over the Internet.</p>
        <p><em><strong>If you get an error message on the Pricing
        and Restrictions screen ( where the phrase &quot;I accept
        these restrictions and want to purchase this travel&quot;

        you have run into a firewall</strong></em>. Ask your
        system administrator to reconfigure the firewall - the
        port for secure HTTP is 443 and it needs to be opened.</p>

        equivalent to Netscape Navigator 1.22 or greater in order
        to purchase Ticketless Travel through the Southwest
        Airlines Home Gate. You can go to the Netscape site at <a
        href="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/client_download.html">http://home.netscape.com</a>
        and download the newest version of Netscape Navigator.
        For the best results, we recommend Netscape Navigator 3.0
        or greater. Equivalent browsers include Microsoft
        Internet Explorer 3.0, America Online 3.0 for Windows,
        and Prodigy. In order to use the Ticketless Travel Online
        successfully, the browser you use must support Tables and
        Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption.</p>
        <p><strong>Please note:</strong> </p>
        <p>&#149; Netscape Navigator 3.03 does not allow the user
        to change the number of passengers for Ticketless Travel
        Online. Please <a
        href="http://www.netscape.com/download/index.html">upgrade
        your browser to a higher version of Netscape Navigator or
        use a previously released version of Netscape Navigator</a>.</p>
        <p>&#149; Windows 3.1 users who are using Microsoft
        Internet Explorer 3.0 may <em><strong>not</strong></em>
        be able to successfully complete a Ticketless Travel
        booking. Please upgrade your browser to <a
        href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/download/">Microsoft
        Internet Explorer 3.02A or higher</a>.</p>
        <p>&#149; Please note that any &quot;Beta&quot; or
        &quot;Preview&quot; version of a browser may not properly
        work with these pages. Please upgrade your browser to a
        previously released version of either Netscape Navigator
        or Microsoft Internet Explorer.</p>

        corporation has a firewall which is preventing encrypted
        traffic from flowing from the Southwest web site back to
        you. Ask your system administrator to reconfigure the
        firewall - the port for secure HTTP is 443 and it needs

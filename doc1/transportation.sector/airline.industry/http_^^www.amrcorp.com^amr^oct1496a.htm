<H2>The American Airlines-British Airways Alliance Will Benefit Consumers and
Enhance Competition</H2>
<HR>
<H3> Introduction </H3>
<P>The proposed Alliance between American Airlines and British Airways will
provide passengers and shippers with the benefits of truly global operations.
In the past several decades, finance and commerce have become increasingly
global. Airlines have developed on a parallel course, by expanding their
networks, developing their own route systems, and linking their systems
in codesharing and other types of alliances. Air transport has been a catalyst
in the worldwide expansion of business, and will continue to advance the
frontiers of enterprise. </P>
<P>The airline industry is a network business. In the past, carriers built
linear route systems, and were content to transfer passengers to another
airline to get them to their destinations. Following deregulation of the
domestic U.S. airline industry in 1978, airlines abandoned linear route
systems in favor of hub-and-spoke networks, which greatly increased efficiency
and geographical scope. In the past few years, this process has begun to
take root in international aviation. International air carriers now recognize
that global hubs are an effective way to keep customers on their network
or that of a partner, and that hub-and-spoke networks provide more choice
and convenience to passengers and shippers, and more benefit to the airline. </P>
<P>That recognition is the impetus for the alliance between American Airlines
and British Airways, and for the other major global alliances that have
been formed in the past five years: Lufthansa-United-SAS, KLM-Northwest,
and Delta-Sabena-Swissair-Austrian. These other alliances are already operating
successfully, in large part because the U.S. Department of Transportation
(DOT) has granted them immunity from U.S. antitrust laws, effectively permitting
each alliance to operate as if it were a single company. The American Airlines-British Airways alliance, announced on June 11, 1996,
has three main elements: </P>
<OL>
<LI> Coordination of all passenger and cargo services that the two carriers
operate between the United States and Europe, with profit sharing on Alliance
services. 
<LI> Codesharing across each other's global networks; wherever possible, American
will place its &quot;AA&quot; designator code on British Airways' transatlantic services
and flights beyond BA's European gateways, and British Airways will place
its &quot;BA&quot; code on American's transatlantic services and flights beyond American's
U.S. gateways. 
<LI> Establishment of a fully reciprocal, worldwide frequent flyer program. The Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom have recognized
that the American-British Airways alliance presents an historic opportunity
to liberalize one of the more restrictive bilateral aviation agreements
in the world. This 1977 agreement, known as Bermuda 2, limits competition
and consumer choice, and keeps fares higher than they should be. The Alliance
and a new U.S.-U.K. &quot;open skies&quot; agreement are inextricably linked: without
a new aviation agreement, there can be no Alliance, and without both Governments'
approval of the Alliance, there will be no open skies between our two countries.
Such an accord would be &quot;win-win&quot; for both Governments: the United States
will secure an open, highly competitive marketplace and access to London's
Heathrow Airport, Europe's busiest; and the United Kingdom will gain broadened
opportunities for British Airways, one of its most successful companies. 
</OL>
<P>An open skies agreement with the United Kingdom will add great momentum
to the growing trend toward liberalization of international air transport.
Since 1992, the United States has concluded open skies agreements with Germany,
the Netherlands, Sweden, and nine other countries in Western Europe, as
well as with Canada, our largest trading partner. A liberalized agreement
with the United Kingdom will not only add the largest intercontinental air
travel market, but will send a strong message to recalcitrant trading partners,
notably Japan, which have regarded Bermuda 2 as a model for continuing their
own protectionist agreements. </P>
<P>In seeking government approval of their codesharing program and a grant
of antitrust immunity, American and British Airways wish only to secure
the same ability to compete globally that is now enjoyed by United, Northwest,
and Delta. </P>
<H3>The Public Policy Basis for Government Approval </H3>
<P>The American-British Airways alliance is fully consistent with U.S. Government
policy. The U.S. International Air Transportation Policy Statement, which
the DOT issued on May 3, 1995, explicitly encouraged the development of
such global alliances: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Just as U.S. carriers developed hub-and-spoke systems to tap the broad
traffic pool in the domestic market and to provide the most cost-efficient
service for hundreds of communities that could not support direct service,
international air carriers are developing world-wide hub-and-spoke systems
to tap the substantial pool of international city-pairs . . . [O]ur international
aviation strategy should provide opportunities for [global networks] so
that we realize the benefits from maximum competition among them.&quot; </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Federal aviation statute, 49 USC 41309, provides an unequivocal basis
for approval of the Alliance. It requires the Secretary of Transportation
to approve an inter-carrier agreement, such as the American-British Airways
alliance, &quot;that is necessary to meet a serious transportation need or to
achieve important public benefits (including international comity and foreign
policy considerations).&quot; The law requires DOT to balance public benefits
against any possible anticompetitive harm. This was the same test that DOT
used in evaluating the first request for antitrust immunity, when it granted
the application of KLM and Northwest in 1993. Subsequent DOT grants of immunity
to Lufthansa-United-SAS and Delta-Sabena-Swissair-Austrian have relied on
this same foundation of balanced assessment. </P>
<P>The founding document of the European Union, the Treaty of Rome, which governs
many aspects of competition in the EU, requires a similar evaluation. Article
85 requires officials to weigh public benefits against possible damage to
competition, and comprises the test for evaluation of the Alliance by the
competition authorities of the United Kingdom. </P>
<P>The benefits of the American-British Airways alliance are significant and
compelling. The Department of Transportation should approve the Alliance
and grant it antitrust immunity. </P>
<H3>Benefits of the American-British Airways Alliance </H3>
<P>There are four main benefits: competition with existing global alliances,
which will provide more and better service to passengers and shippers; new
services on less-traveled routes; reduced costs; and, for the first time
ever, open competition in an important market. </P>
<P>The Alliance will, when fully developed, offer coordinated service between
over 36,000 combinations of origin and destination cities, making more of
the world more accessible to consumers, and providing substantial new competition
for the three major global alliances that are operating today. A traveler
between, for example, Kansas City and Vienna can now choose to fly via the
KLM-Northwest, Lufthansa-United-SAS, or Delta-Sabena-Swissair-Austrian alliances;
the American-BA alliance will provide yet another choice. </P>
<P>The significance of itineraries like Kansas City-Vienna or Syracuse-Helsinki
is frequently overlooked, because many of us live in or near gateway cities
with a wide array of transatlantic services. However, airlines are a network
business, and they depend on four types of international traffic flows: </P>
<OL>
<LI> Gateway to gateway, such as New York-London 
<LI> Behind U.S. gateway to a foreign gateway, such as New Orleans-Brussels,
via Atlanta 
<LI> U.S. gateway to beyond a foreign gateway, such as Los Angeles-Oslo, via
Amsterdam 
<LI> Behind U.S. gateway to beyond a foreign gateway, such as Omaha-Bahrain,
via Chicago and Frankfurt 
</OL>
<P>International alliances seek to maximize the number of passengers traveling
wholly on the services of the partners by offering large numbers of origin-and-destination
possibilities, and combining customers at hubs in the U.S. and overseas. </P>
<P>In a network business, big is good, because customers can take advantage
of a wider choice of routings, flights, and fares than would be offered
on an interline basis. These greater choices can only be offered by airlines
that enjoy antitrust immunity, which enable them to make joint decisions
and combine operations to provide conveniences equal to those a passenger
would get if traveling on a single carrier. </P>
<P>Here's how this will work once the American-BA alliance is in operation.
If customers need to travel between Tucson and Berlin, the Alliance can
take them all the way. Their travel agent sees a Tucson-Chicago-London-Berlin
itinerary displayed in her computer reservation system as a convenient single-airline
service, and she can issue advance boarding passes for all three legs of
the journey. They need only deal with baggage once, in Tucson. American
and British Airways have coordinated their schedules at Chicago and London,
to minimize connecting time. Interconnected information systems have relayed
requests for special meals. Signs and personnel responsible for connecting
passengers direct them through the airports in Chicago and London. And,
of course, they earn AAdvantage or Executive Club miles for their entire
journey, which are good for free travel on either carrier, or on many affiliated
airlines. </P>
<P>A second advantage for consumers is that by combining their marketing capabilities
and distribution networks, the two airlines will also be able to operate
new nonstop services on many routes that heretofore could not sustain profitable
operations. Provided that sufficient demand exists, the Alliance will offer
new services that bypass the U.S. hubs of American or BA's London gateways. </P>
<P>These new and expanded services will bring substantial benefits to communities
and regions worldwide. Improved air services will increase inbound tourism,
encourage exports, and promote general economic development, thereby generating
growth in employment and tax revenues. </P>
<P>A third benefit is that the synergies and efficiencies of joint Alliance
operations will reduce costs at both airlines, with savings that will be
passed along to travelers and shippers. These efficiencies will flow primarily
from five sources: </P>
<OL>
<LI> Joint decisions on scheduling will enable American and BA to match capacity
and demand more effectively, thus using assets more intensively. For example,
the average number of seats per Alliance departure will increase, which
will drive down unit costs. As at all other businesses, less waste benefits
consumers. 
<LI> Joint management of inventory will also increase efficiency and consumer
welfare. Because discount-fare passengers book in advance, while full-fare
passengers book close to departure, airline inventory management starts
by forecasting how many full-fare seats to set aside. Joint inventory management
will permit more accurate demand forecasts, thus American and BA will be
able to allocate more seats to discount fares. 
<LI> Joint purchasing will drive down expenses in many key categories, such
as aircraft fuel and catering. 
<LI> More efficient use of airport personnel and facilities will also yield
lower unit costs. 
<LI> Joint development of large-scale information systems will reduce costs
and provide travelers and shippers with greater convenience. 
</OL>
<P>A fourth benefit is that the Alliance will make possible an open skies agreement
between the United States and the United Kingdom. As noted above, the existing
agreement, Bermuda 2, imposes a range of burdensome restrictions on which
airlines can offer service, what routes can be flown, how many flight frequencies
can be offered (sometimes even dictating the type of aircraft to be used),
and what prices can be charged. As a result, competition in the U.S.-U.K.
air travel market, the largest intercontinental market in the world, has
been limited. </P>
<P>Since 1977, the Bermuda 2 agreement has been revised several times in ways
that greatly favor U.K. airlines. Despite the proliferation of open skies
agreements between the United States and many other countries in Western
Europe, including Germany, the United Kingdom has not been amenable to an
open agreement, because it could not see net benefit to U.K. interests.
Nor did the United Kingdom see the need to make further incremental changes
to Bermuda 2, because it believed that it had secured all that was needed.
Now, however, the United Kingdom understands that the winds of liberalization
are gathering speed, and the U.K. wants British Airways to have the benefits
of the Alliance. Thus, the Alliance presents an historic opportunity to
secure a balanced, pro-consumer aviation agreement. </P>
<P>What will an open skies agreement make possible? Because the limitations
on designation-which airlines can operate-will disappear, as will controls
on routes, new airlines will be flying new routes. Indeed, a forthcoming
study of the effects of U.S.-U.K. open skies predicts that as many as 20
new U.S.-U.K. routes will be opened up during the first five years of the
agreement, with up to 463 new flights per week in each direction. This will
benefit not only the gateways that will receive nonstop service, but also
hundreds of smaller communities that will enjoy many new connecting possibilities
to the United Kingdom and to the rest of the world. </P>
<P>Because the stringent restrictions on access to Heathrow Airport will also
disappear, many U.S. airlines will join American and United there. Because
there will no longer be controls on flight frequency, there will be new
services on existing routes, to match consumer demand, not bureaucratic
whim. And because government pricing controls will be eliminated, the United
Kingdom will no longer have the right to disapprove fares it decides are
too low. With respect to price, the fundamental laws of supply and demand
clearly will operate: with abundant new service and reinvigorated competition,
prices will decline. </P>
<P>An open skies agreement will also give U.S. airlines the right to carry
local passengers originating in the United Kingdom to points beyond in Europe,
Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. For example, Delta will have the right
to carry a business traveler from London to Zurich, either with its own
aircraft or through its alliance with Swissair. Bermuda 2 contained almost
none of these opportunities, known as Fifth Freedom rights, and this has
been a contentious issue for many years. </P>
<P>It is important to note that unlike previous open skies agreements with
European countries, which have not generated substantial new services, there
is substantial unmet demand for U.S.-U.K. services. Most other open skies
markets are 1) not large enough to enable profitable new operations, or
2) the national airline of the European country has been allied with a U.S.
carrier, and the strength of the alliance combined with the limited size
of the local market has discouraged new entry. For example, since the 1992
open skies agreement with the Netherlands, no new U.S. service has started,
except that offered by KLM's partner, Northwest. These conditions will not
apply in the large U.S.-U.K. market, where solid demand and a growing market
will provide significant opportunities for greatly expanded services under
an open skies agreement. </P>
<H3>Answering our Critics </H3>
<P>Since announcement of the American-British Airways alliance on June 11,
1996, other U.S. and U.K. airlines have criticized the proposed transaction.
Their arguments reduce to three: </P>
<OL>
<LI> The Alliance is too big. 
<LI> The Alliance will dominate U.S.-U.K. air travel, and raise prices to consumers. 
<LI> Even under an open skies regime, genuine U.S.-U.K. competition will be
impossible because of slot and facility constraints at London's Heathrow
Airport. 
</OL>
<P>None of these arguments is valid. </P>
<H3>The Alliance Is Not &quot;Too Big&quot; - It Is Smaller than Two Existing Alliances </H3>
<P>When fully developed, the Alliance will provide on-line convenience to approximately
36,000 city-pair markets, directly benefiting consumers and communities,
and providing substantial global competition with the existing alliances
operated by United, Northwest, and Delta. Potential city-pair markets is
an appropriate measure of alliance size, because in a network business each
origin-destination market is a unique product, and the success of an alliance
depends on maximizing the numbers of products that can be offered. </P>
<P>In terms of worldwide city-pair markets, the American-British Airways alliance
is smaller than the Lufthansa-United-SAS alliance, which will offer over
55,000 potential city-pairs (over 50 percent larger than American-BA); smaller
than the KLM-Northwest alliance, which will offer over 36,500; and only
slightly larger than Delta-Sabena-Swissair-Austrian, which will offer over
33,500. </P>
<P>American and British Airways will initially have a smaller share of operations
at Heathrow Airport, 41 percent, than Lufthansa-United-SAS at Frankfurt
(54 percent), KLM-Northwest at Amsterdam (56 percent), or Delta-Sabena-Swissair-Austrian
at Brussels (56 percent), Zurich (64 percent) or Vienna (54 percent). Even
more significantly, the 41 percent AA-BA share at Heathrow will decline
as new carriers enter the U.S.-Heathrow market. </P>
<P>The Alliance is approximately the same size as Lufthansa-United-SAS in revenue
passenger miles (RPMs) and smaller in the following measures: </P>
<P><table width=100%>
<tr valign=top><td><B>Measure</B> </td><td><B>Lufthansa-United-SAS</B> </td><td><B>American-BA</B> </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td>Revenue passenger miles </td><td>160.4 billion </td><td>165.3 billion </td></tr>

<tr valign=top><td>Jet aircraft operated </td><td>903 </td><td>878 </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td>Total employees </td><td>161,000 </td><td>137,000 </td></tr>
</table></P>
<P>To inflate the size of the American-BA alliance, some critics have included
USAir in their comparisons. USAir should not be included. In announcing
the Alliance in June, American welcomed USAir's participation. Since then,
however, USAir has publicly stated that it has no place in the proposed
Alliance, and has sued British Airways in order to terminate the BA/USAir
relationship. In these circumstances, it is misleading to include USAir
in statistical comparisons of the various alliances. </P>
<H3>The Alliance Will Not Dominate the U.S.-U.K. Market </H3>
<P>Critics who claim that the Alliance will dominate the U.S.-U.K. air travel
market simply take the current highly regulated and restricted environment,
and project it into the future, when open skies will prevail. The illogic
is plain. </P>
<P>An open skies regime will produce far more competition, and will reduce
significantly the current market share held by American and British Airways.
A forthcoming study of the likely effects of U.S.-U.K. open skies projects
that after five years, the combined share of American and British Airways
in the U.S.-London market will decline from the 61 percent under today's
restrictions, to 41 percent under open skies, a drop of 20 points. A combined
market share of 41 percent would be substantially smaller than the current
market shares of other transatlantic alliances at their European gateways,
and only slightly larger than Lufthansa-United-SAS to Germany: </P>
<P><table width=100%>
<tr valign=top><td><B>Market</B></td><td><B>Alliance Share*</B> </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td>U.S.-Germany United-Lufthansa-SAS </td><td>40% </td></tr>

<tr valign=top><td>U.S.-Belgium Delta-Sabena-Swissair-Austrian </td><td>74% </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td>U.S.-Austria Delta-Sabena-Swissair-Austrian </td><td>100% </td></tr>
</table></P>
<P>* Measured in frequencies </P>
<P>A U.S.-U.K. open skies agreement will be the first of its kind that produces
not just more frequencies, but several new routes as well. Many U.S. cities
have sufficient local demand to London to justify nonstop service that bypasses
current U.S. gateways. </P>
<P>Other U.S. airlines assert that British Airways' Heathrow hub gives it an
unfair advantage in the U.S.-U.K. market. However, after an open skies agreement
is concluded, these airlines will seek to commence Heathrow services from
their own U.S. hubs, thus establishing offsetting competition between their
hub network and that of BA at London. As noted below, several carriers have
already applied to DOT to provide this service. </P>
<P>Some critics have complained that the Alliance's combined frequencies on
U.S.-London routes would give it too much market strength, citing theoretical
economic literature from the domestic U.S. airline industry. The notion
is that high frequency service enables airlines to capture the high-yield
business passenger, who values the convenience of multiple flights. However,
most U.S.-U.K. routes only have one or two departures per day, which precludes
frequency as a competitive factor. Even at New York, where American and
BA operate multiple flights, several other airlines already compete effectively,
and more are likely to enter the market. </P>
<P>Critics have said that if the Alliance is approved, fares will rise. Such
a forecast is nonsense. Basic economics teaches that when supply rises,
prices fall. An open skies agreement will free five new U.S. carriers to
serve Heathrow; the price pressure they will exert will cause prices to
decline, not increase. </P>
<P>British Airways has built its market share under the protective conditions
of Bermuda 2. Those restrictions will disappear in an open skies environment.
Our critics cannot decry the existing, restrictive competitive situation
without acknowledging the open skies environment which will replace Bermuda
2 as a precondition for approval of the Alliance. </P>
<P>Critics have also focused attention on six U.S.-London routes that American
and British Airways both operate, and have predicted a range of adverse
consequences for consumers flying those routes. Opponents of the Alliance
ignore the fact that under an open skies agreement, any U.S. or U.K. carrier
will be able to operate on any or all of these six routes, from New York,
Boston, Miami, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, and Los Angeles-or on any other
route to London. </P>
<P>Listed below are cities that would almost certainly gain new service to
Heathrow after the two Governments sign an open skies agreement: </P>
<P><table width=100%>
<tr valign=top><td>Airline </td><td>Gateway </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td>Continental </td><td>Newark <BR>

Pittsburgh </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td>Northwest </td><td>Detroit <BR>
Minneapolis/St. Paul </td></tr>
</table></P>
<P>In fact, in September, DOT tentatively granted new authority (which presently
exists under 1995 changes to Bermuda 2) to a low-cost, start-up airline,
Vision Air, to fly between New York and London/Stansted. Anticipating the
new bilateral agreement, TWA has already applied for New York-London/Heathrow
authority, and USAir has applied to serve Boston-London/Heathrow. At Chicago,
Virgin Atlantic is eligible for designation, even under Bermuda 2, and has
expressed interest in the route. Also at Chicago, United will be permitted
under existing rules to add service to London in January 1997. At New York,
Boston, Miami, and Los Angeles, Delta currently has a blocked-space codesharing
arrangement with Virgin Atlantic, which it could convert to its own operations.
At Fort Lauderdale, Laker Airways, which once operated as a U.K. carrier
but is now owned and controlled by U.S. investors, began operations to London
this year. </P>
<P>Our critics have attempted to inflate the relative importance of the six
overlap markets that both American and British Airways serve. In previous
analyses of the probable competitive impact of global alliances, the U.S.
Justice Department has been most interested in the time-sensitive business
passenger. For American, in the year ended June 1996, only six percent of
its total transatlantic passengers were time-sensitive business customers
traveling on these six overlap routes. Given the competitive alternatives
that exist today-including numerous one-stop connecting routings for passengers
traveling to London from Los Angeles, Dallas/Fort Worth, Chicago, and Miami-and
the certainty of more nonstop and more connecting itineraries under an open
skies regime, neither American or British Airways will be able to raise
prices on these or any other U.S.-London routes. Other airlines, including
many of our critics, operate many nonstop U.S.-London routes today without
any other nonstop competition, such as Delta on the Cincinnati-London route
and TWA on the St. Louis-London route. These carriers cannot exercise monopoly
pricing because of convenient competing service via numerous other U.S.
gateways. </P>
<H3>Heathrow Is Not &quot;Full&quot; </H3>
<P>The final criticism of the proposed Alliance is that even if the U.S.-U.K.
agreement is liberalized, no meaningful competition will result, because
the most desirable U.K. airport, Heathrow, is &quot;full&quot;. </P>
<P>Despite the rhetorical focus on Heathrow, more than one-third of all U.S.-London
passengers fly to or from London/Gatwick, and U.S. airlines have successfully
operated at Gatwick for many years. That said, we recognize the importance
of Heathrow, and the need to look at the facts about that airport. </P>
<P>Once again, our critics wish to portray a static situation. However, Heathrow
is not &quot;full&quot;, in terms either of slots or of available passenger facilities.
BAA PLC., the operator of Heathrow, NATS, the U.K. air traffic control service,
and others have steadily increased operational efficiency in the air and
on the ground, which has permitted significant increases in available slots
(a slot is a reservation for an aircraft to land or take off at a specific
time on a specific day). In fact, since spring 1991, 45 new airlines have
been able to secure viable slots and begin operating at Heathrow, and 32
of these are still providing service. In 1995 alone, seven new carriers
commenced Heathrow operations. Between 1992 and 1996, 71 daily peak-hour
slots were added at Heathrow. </P>
<P>Diligent airlines that work to increase their operations at Heathrow have
been successful. For example, between 1992 (American's first full year of
Heathrow operations) and 1995, American increased its slot holdings by 33
percent. Every year since 1992, American has been able to add one daily
flight. Virgin Atlantic, which has opposed the proposed Alliance and which
has complained frequently about the alleged inequities of slot allocation,
has increased its slots by 171 percent between 1992 and 1995, a growth rate
five times faster than American's, and thirteen times greater than that
of British Airways. </P>
<P>Our critics claim that the American and British Airways have a &quot;pool&quot; of
slots at Heathrow that give the Alliance a present and future advantage.
However, the other global alliances also have access to substantial slot
holdings at Heathrow that could be reallocated to U.S.-U.K. service. For
example, United-Lufthansa-SAS control approximately ten percent of Heathrow
slots, and some of these, which are currently allocated for relatively short-haul
services, could be reassigned to transatlantic flights. </P>
<P>Further increases in Heathrow slots are likely. A 1994 report prepared by
BAA, NATS, and the International Air Transport Association concluded that
Heathrow runway capacity could increase substantially and with relatively
small, already proven changes in operating procedures. </P>
<P>For perspective, the approximately 600 daily round-trip operations at Heathrow
this year compares with the over 750 daily round-trip operations at Miami
International Airport, an airport with broadly comparable runway configuration
and which operates at approximately 62 percent of capacity. </P>
<P>American has urged the U.K. Government to take a proactive position that
supports the buying and selling of slots. The current policy of the European
Commission, which governs slot allocation in the United Kingdom and elsewhere
in the EU, does not explicitly prohibit the sale of slots. Clearly, this
market-based action would be the instant solution to the problem of slot
availability. </P>
<P>Nor are terminal facilities static. Indeed, BAA has embarked on an enormous
development scheme to create a fifth terminal at Heathrow, which is expected
to be completed by 2001. Contrary to our critics, BAA, which controls gate
allocation (rather than using the more familiar U.S. practice of long-term
gate leases for the exclusive use of one carrier), has not designated Terminal
5 to be the exclusive province of British Airways. In addition, BAA is continuously
renewing and expanding the other four passenger terminals. </P>
<H3>Conclusion </H3>
<P>The proposed alliance between American and British Airways, coupled with
the prerequisite open skies agreement between the United States and the
United Kingdom, will greatly improve consumer convenience and choice, produce
operating efficiencies that will produce greater value for passengers and
shippers, increase competition in thousands of city-pair markets, and generate
economic benefits for communities across the worldwide networks of both
airlines. The Department of Transportation has already approved and granted
antitrust immunity to the global alliances of United, Northwest, and Delta.
Consistent with established DOT policy, the American-British Airways alliance
should likewise be approved and immunized in the interest of consumer benefits
and enhanced competition. </P>

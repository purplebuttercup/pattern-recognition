<p><font size="5">Southwest Airlines and Icelandair Expand
Marketing Agreement<br>
</font><em>Roundtrip Travel Now Available to Europe with
Exceptionally Low Fares</em></p>

<hr>

<p><b>DALLAS/COLUMBIA, MD</b>--Aug. 14, 1997--Southwest Airlines
and Icelandair announced today the two carriers have expanded
their marketing agreement to include Chicago Midway, Louisville,
and Providence. </p>

<p>Southwest and Icelandair began a test program representing a
single-route marketing agreement providing a link between Europe
and Cleveland on Jan. 22, 1997.</p>

<p>The expanded agreement states Southwest will transport
Customers from Chicago Midway, Cleveland, Providence, or
Louisville to Icelandair&#146;s Baltimore\Washington (BWI)
gateway, where passengers will continue to Iceland via Icelandair
en route to destinations in the UK, Scandinavia, and continental
Europe. Under the expanded test program, all reservations and
ticketing will continue to be handled by Icelandair Reservations
at (800) 223-5500.</p>

<p>A special roundtrip fare of $298 from Chicago Midway,
Cleveland, Louisville, or Providence to <a
href="/images/luxmap.jpg">Luxembourg, Europe&#146;s Western
gateway</a> (see how accessible Luxembourg, the Crossroads of
Europe, is to many European cities - map size 89k) , is available
between Nov. 1 and Dec. 11. From Sept. 10 through Oct. 31 the
fare from Chicago Midway, Cleveland, Louisville, or Providence to
Luxembourg is $398. No advance purchase is required. Some travel
restrictions apply: ticketing required within 48 hours of
reservations; minimum stay requires Saturday night stayover:
21-day maximum stay; and seats are limited. Tickets are
nonrefundable and change fees will apply. Airport-assessed
passenger facility charges and international departure taxes also
will apply. Reservations may be made immediately with travel
beginning Sept. 10, 1997.</p>

<p>&quot;Southwest has been pleased so far with the marketing
agreement. Icelandair is a great partner. This expanded agreement
brings great value for Customers traveling to Europe,&quot; said
Dave Ridley, Southwest&#146;s vice president of marketing and
sales. &quot;We are expanding the program to further test its
impact on our operations. Our primary interest in this
relationship is its effect on our efficient, low cost procedures.
Thus far there has been no adverse impact on Southwest&#146;s
operations.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is a very exciting development of our partnership
with Southwest Airlines,&quot; said Gunnar Eklund, director, the
Americas for Icelandair, &quot;and it is certainly in line with
the projections we had hoped for when we started the Southwest
Airlines/Icelandair test marketing project for travel between
Cleveland and Europe.&quot; Eklund said the test had worked as
expected &quot;in regard to all the operational parts of the
cooperation.&quot; By adding Chicago Midway, Louisville, and
Providence to the partnership, Eklund added, &quot;we are certain
to see even more travelers taking advantage of this seamless
Europe travel opportunity--and the unique airfare alternative we
represent for the cost-conscious traveler.&quot;</p>

<p>Southwest and Icelandair have very similar philosophies with
both carriers offering travelers low fares and excellent Customer
Service. Both airlines operate very young all-jet fleets and have
excellent safety and ontime records.</p>

<p>Icelandair&#146;s North American headquarters is located in
Columbia, Maryland, near Baltimore/Washington (BWI) Airport,
which is one of the carrier&#146;s primary North American
gateways. The airline operates Boeing 757s on transatlantic
routes, and both Boeing 757s and 737-400s to Europe.</p>

<p>In addition to Reykjavik, Icelandair&#146;s European
destinations include London, Glasgow, Amsterdam, Copenhagen,
Oslo, Stockholm, Luxembourg, Hamburg, and Frankfurt. Icelandair
operates six North American gateways: Boston, New York (JFK),
Baltimore/Washington (BWI), Orlando, Ft. Lauderdale, and Halifax,
Nova Scotia, with Minneapolis-St. Paul opening April 1998. </p>

<p>Southwest Airlines, now the nation&#146;s fifth largest
carrier in terms of Customer boardings, serves 51 cities in 25
states. The airline currently has more than 25,000 Employees and
operates more than 2,200 flights a day.</p>

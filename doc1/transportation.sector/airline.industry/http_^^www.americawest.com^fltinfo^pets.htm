<p>Your pet wouldn't want to be treated as cargo any more than
you would. That's why on America West, we allow dogs, cats, and
birds to travel in the cabin with you. They might not be in your
lap, but at least they'll know you're nearby. You'll be more
comfortable -- and so will they. After all, even birds sometimes
need a little extra lift. </p>

and Fees</font><br>
In addition to the acceptance of trained animals to assist
physically challenged passengers, America West accepts small
domesticated animals in the passenger cabin. America West will
accept domestic dogs, cats, and household birds. Three animals
(one First Class, 2 Coach) will be permitted per aircraft.
Acceptance of the animal will be in lieu of one piece of carry-on
luggage. Animals will not be accepted as checked luggage or for
international transport. Acceptance of these animals is subject
to the following conditions of acceptance, container
requirements, and the applicable charges.<br>
<br>
<b>Conditions of Use</b><br>
One pet container per passenger is allowed unless the passenger
purchases an extra seat for the second container to be placed
under, based on the following cabin seat baggage charges: the
lesser of 50 percent of the full first class/coach fare or 100
percent of the full discounted fare (the $50 cabin pet charge
will be waived for the 2nd container). One pet per container with
the exception of litter mates, i.e. kittens or puppies. Animals
are not allowed to travel with unaccompanied minors. Advance
notice, i.e. reservation, must be made. The animal must be
harmless, inoffensive, odorless, and require no attention during
transit. The animal must be confined in a cage or container which
is subject to inspection and approval by America West. The
passenger must make all arrangements and assume full
responsibility for complying with any applicable laws, customs,
and/or other governmental regulations and restrictions of the
country/state or territory to which the animal is being
transported.<br>
<br>
<b>Documentation Requirements</b><br>
Health certificate issued within 10 days of originating travel
must be presented. Rabies certificates for dogs only.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1582360"></a><font color="#408080" size="4">Provisions
of Carriage</font><br>
Container must be stored under the seat directly in front of the
passenger. Animal must remain in container while on board the
aircraft. In the event the animal becomes offensive or causes a
disturbance, the pet can be removed at the first enroute stop. </p>

<p><font color="#408080" size="4">Charges</font><br>
Charge for acceptance of pets in the cabin is $50 USD. Charge
must be paid at an America West ticketing facility. Failure to
meet the conditions of acceptance will result in America West's
refusal to transport the animal.</p>

<p><a name="anchor1601338"></a><font color="#408080" size="4">Container
Requirements</font><br>
All containers must be provided by the passenger. Containers must
be leak proof, ventilated on at least two sides, and must prevent
any part of the animal from protruding outside the container.
Container must be made of metal, wood, plastic, or material of
similar strength. However, soft-sided containers specifically
designed for pet carriage will be accepted for transport.
Cardboard pet containers are also acceptable. One animal per
container with the exception of litter mates. </p>

<p><a name="anchor1601925"></a><font color="#408080" size="4">Acceptance
of Service Animals</font><br>
Trained service animals, including working dogs/monkeys, will be
accepted for transport in the passenger cabin provided one of the
following forms of documentation is presented: <br>
1. Identification cards or written documentation. <br>
2. Markings on harness or tags<br>
<br>
<i>Note: Service animals are subject to all regulations governing
transport and entry requirements for pets when traveling outside
the continental U.S. </i></p>

<p><a name="anchor1602238"></a><font color="#408080" size="4">Pets
as Cargo</font><br>
America West cannot accept any animals as cargo or checked
baggage. If another airline mistakenly routes an animal on
America West, we will do our utmost to re-route the animal on
another carrier as a courtesy to the passenger. If America West
cannot re-route the animal, the airline that mis-routed the
animal will be notified of the error and the animal will be
returned. </p>

Pet Transportation Policy<br>
</font><b>Cabin Pets</b><br>
Cabin pets are acceptable for carriage on America West Express
flights. America West Airlines rates will apply. A maximum of two
(2) cabin pets will be permitted on each America West Express
flight.<br>
<br>
However, on flights operated with Beech 1900 (BE1) or Brasilia
equipment (EM2), the pet will be transported in the cargo hold
due to cabin size limitations. (This does not classify the pet as
a cargo pet.) The pet carrier will be tagged with a special
handling tag, loaded on the aircraft at the time of passenger
enplanement, and returned to the owner upon arrival at the gate.<br>
<br>
<b>Cargo Pets</b><br>
Pets that do not fit the size requirements as a cabin pet can be
transported as freight on America West Express flights operated
with Beech 1900 (BE1) or Brasilia equipment (EM2).<br>
<br>
Cargo pets will not be accepted from April through October or
when the temperature is above 80 degrees Fahrenheit. A maximum of
one (1) cargo animal will be permitted per aircraft. (Exception:
this limit does not apply to cargo transport of animals for pet
stores. Size and space will be the determining factors.)<br>
<br>
For the transportation of &quot;cargo pets only,&quot; prior
approval must be obtained from the Phoenix America West Express
station manager prior to departure. For approval, rates, and
complete details, contact America West Express at (602) 693-2984.
Space may be limited on some flights. </p>

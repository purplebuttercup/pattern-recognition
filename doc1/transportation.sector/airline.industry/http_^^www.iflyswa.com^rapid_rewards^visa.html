<p><font size="4">What you need to know about the Southwest
Airlines Rapid Rewards VISA</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Not already a Member of Rapid Rewards?<br>
You can still apply for the VISA card!</font></p>

<p><font size="4">If you are not already a Freedom Reward Member
of Rapid Rewards, First USA will instantly enroll you! You will
receive your VISA card in the mail, and you will receive your
plastic Rapid Rewards membership card from Southwest Airlines in
a separate mailing.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Please note that with Rapid Rewards instant
enrollments, a free Award Ticket is not included in the
membership kit. Once you have accumulated 16 flight credits
within 12 consecutive months, an Award Ticket will be
automatically issued.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">If you already have a Rapid Rewards Temporary
Membership Card, hold on to it until you receive your plastic
membership card. Then, write the new membership number on the
Temporary Membership Card and send it to Rapid Rewards (address
on the form) to have the appropriate flight credit(s) deposited
in your new Rapid Rewards account.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Please call First USA Bank Customer Service at
1-888-SWA-0001 regarding any of the following issues with your

</ul>

<p><font size="4">Can I present my Southwest Airlines Rapid
Rewards VISA at the gate in lieu of presenting my Rapid Rewards
membership card to receive credit for my trip?</font></p>

<p><font size="4">No. It is still necessary to present your Rapid
Rewards membership card at the gate in order to earn flight
credits for traveling on Southwest Airlines. You may not present
your Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards VISA card instead. Of
course, the Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards VISA Card is
welcomed as a form of payment at the ticket counter.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">If I currently have a First USA VISA may I
switch over to the Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards VISA?</font></p>

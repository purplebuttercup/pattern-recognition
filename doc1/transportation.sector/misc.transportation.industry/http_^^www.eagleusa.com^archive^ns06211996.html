<I><B>Eagle USA Airfreight's Stock Up 63 Percent Since Dec. 95 IPO</B></I><p>

To hear Jim Crane tell it, 

growing Eagle USA Airfreight from two employees in 1984 to 1,000

today has everything to do with common sense.

<P>

Maybe that's why the company is so uncommon.

<P>

In the six months since its shares went public, the Houston 

company has broken from the pack to become a darling of the

United States' crowded freight forwarding business.

<P>

The earthshaking methods Crane has used to fly Eagle above

its rivals? Crane repeats what has become the company's motto:

Sell it, service it, and collect it.

<P>

Crane, founder and chief executive of Eagle, and his top

managers say it is by doing these business basics that they've become

the nation's largest air freight forwarding company, with terminals 

in 45 U.S. cities.

<P>

Paying attention to the fundamentals has kept Eagle on track

to increase revenues 40 percent again this fiscal year, to a 

projected $175 million, and cause it to split the seams of leased

facilities at Houston Intercontinental Airport. To accommodate

its burgeoning operation, Eagle plans to break ground soon on a

$4.5 million headquarters and warehouse on 22 acres it purchased

near the airport.

<P>

The reason Eagle does the basics better than its competitors,

Crane said, is that it treats its employees better. The company

pays its people well above average for the industry, and everyone, 

from supervisors to dock hands, participates in a profit-sharing plan.

These pay policies, unique in the historically low-margin business,

are designed, Crane said, to motivate the workforce to put forth 

extra effort.

<P>

"There's a lot of people that do what we do. We really kept to 

the basics, always trying to hire the best people," Crane said.

<P>

"When I got into the business, I saw a lot of turnover.

Somebody would move for $200. I tried to pay our people so that

wouldn't be a problem."

<P>

Eagle has found a profitable niche by focusing on shipments

of more than 70 pounds. Thus, it doesn't compete with the likes

of Federal Express and UPS, which typically transport smaller 

packages and documents . And because it doesn't have its own fleet

of airplanes, it is unlike integrated carriers such as 

Burlington Air Express and Emery Air Freight Corp., which aren't

considered freight forwarders because they handle large shipments

on their own jets.

<P>

In contrast, the only plane Eagle has is a corporate jet that

is partly owned by Crane, and is used not to transport cargo but 

to carry Crane and other executives to company offices and customers.

Instead, Eagle relies on space available on commercial airlines to fly

its customers' cargo.

<P>

This provides greater flexibility and a nearly unlimited route

schedule - and it doesn't tie up assets. For example, it is 6 p.m. 

and you need to send 600 pounds of cargo - the average weight of 

an Eagle shipment - to an assembly line in Detroit by 9 a.m. the next 

day. While their competitors may already have flown their last 

flight or closed their offices for the night, Eagle can make the 

delivery on a number of airlines, on a cargo carrier, or by chartering 

a plane.

<P>

"You're just not going to get that service from anybody else," said 

Bob Block, general manager of transportation and traffic for Stewart & 

Stevenson Services.

<P>

Houston-based Stewart & Stevenson, which makes and services all kinds of 

power equipment, paid Eagle $267,744 last year to ship everything from 

boxes of the company's annual reports to truck parts to 17,000-pound 

turbine engines used in power generators, Block said.

<P>

Another of Eagle's largest customers is Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp., 

which has selected Eagle as its primary air freight shipper.

<P>

While the personal computer business is the company's largest market, 

making up about 25 percent of its '95 revenue, Eagle recently has added

customers as diverse as Nike, Ford, and General Motors.

<P>

The growing base of 4,000 customers has helped Eagle achieve pre-tax

profit margins of about 10 percent of sales - the highest in the

industry says James Parker, an analyst with Humphrey-Robinson Co.,

one of the underwriters for Eagle's stock offering.

<P>

In contrast, San Francisco-based Fritz Cos., a leading air freight

forwarder that specializes in international cargo and is larger than

Eagle, has profit margins of 5.8 percent. Even Fed Ex has a margin of

5.2 percent, Parker said. "This is the only highly profitable significant 

domestic freight forwarder," he said.

<P>

Clearly, Eagle's pay policies have paid off. "They are able to get 

the best people because they end up making the most money. This is a 

people  business," Parker noted. "They're getting more productivity,

and they are just doing a better job."

<P>

The practices have also kept employee turnover low. "If we want

somebody, they are not going anyplace, because their deal here is

too good," said Dan Swannie, vice president of operations, whom Crane

credited as one of the key hires after he launched the company.

<P>

Specifically, Eagle pays quarterly bonuses based in part on how

employees in a work group rate each other in terms of teamwork.

Employees also can earn a bonus each December equal to 10 percent of

their annual salary if their unit is profitable.

<P>

So, an Eagle warehouse worker making $20,000 a year can make an extra

20 percent through quarterly and annual bonuses, while top salespeople

can make several hundred thousand dollars in commissions.

<P>

Moreover, the company matches 100 percent of employees' 

contributions to the 401(k) retirement plan - up to 5 percent of an

employee's salary. Finally, the top 80 managers are granted stock options,

following the company's initial public offering of stock on Dec. 1, which 

raised $30 million to help fuel Eagle's growth.

<P>

Founder Crane, 42, a native of St. Louis, began his career in

that city after earning bachelor's and master's degrees in

industrial safety from Central Missouri State University. But he

moved to Houston in the early 1980's at the urging of a friend who

promised he could make $38,000 or more as a salesman for a freight

forwarding company.

<P>

For a short time, Swannie was Crane's boss in Houston, and 

when Crane started Eagle in 1984 he subleased space from a company

Swannie operated.

<P>

Crane soon lured Swannie to Eagle with a promise of part-ownership,

and a few months later recruited as vice president of sales 

Donnie Roberts, with whom Crane also previously worked. The trio

has been together ever since, with Swannie handling the operations, 

Roberts building the sales force and Crane setting direction and

overseeing it all.

<P>

Swannie, 48, now owns nearly 10 percent of Eagle USA's shares and

is the company's largest shareholder behind Crane, who retains 

about 62 percent of the 8.2 million shares outstanding. Roberts 

owns 2.5 percent of the stock.

<P>

"Jim was always willing to give up the financial rewards to people

willing to put forth those efforts," Swannie said.

<P>

Early on, Eagle was unwittingly funded by Continental Airlines, which

flew about 85 percent of the company's cargo. While Continental was 

mired in its first trip through bankruptcy, it failed to bill Eagle

for about nine months, and "we weren't shaking their tree to send us

a bill," Crane admitted. Eagle did paid the bill.

<P>

But Crane said Eagle doesn't return the favor with its customers,

reminding them about the third operating tenet - collect it.

"If they're not going to pay us within the 30-day terms consistently,

we are not going to finance them, like Continental financed us. We 

can't afford it," Crane said.

<P>

To help maintain financial controls over its growing freight network,

Eagle has built a sophisticated computer system that, among other

things, provides detailed profit and loss data on all of its 45

terminals, which are run day-to-day by local and regional managers.

<P>

The reports provide an efficient system of checks and balances, 

allowing the bosses in Houston to pinpoint any problems in the field

before they become serious. 

<P>

"I have a P&L for every single office right here," Crane said, looking

over a thick computer printout. "I can tell you what Oklahoma City paid

on forklift fuel." The company also allows field managers to "really 

manage their own businesses, and they get paid off the bottom line," 

he said.

<P>

One of the most important items tracked is profit per shipment, something 

not typically measured by competitors, which focus on gross sales,

Swannie said. But this has helped the company weed out big volume 

customers that provide little profit to focus on more profitable ones.

<P>

The company has never opened an office that hasn't made money, said Crane,

who plans to expand to about 75 terminals in the next couple of years.

<P>

The growing network provides existing customers with more places Eagle

can serve them and helps bring in more customers, Paul Schlesinger, 

analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities, noted in a recent

report. He rated the company shares to "outperform" the market.

<P>

In parts of the country where its network is weakest, such as the 

Northeast, Eagle will likely acquire companies, Crane said. After the

public offering, the company is sitting on a ton of cash - about

$29 million - and has no debt, he noted.

<P>

Eagle is also expanding its local delivery operation to many of its

cities, using mostly independent contractor truck owners to pick up 

and deliver freight to for its customers. In addition, the company

is moving overseas by signing up cargo agents in more than 100 

international locations. Crane expects international accounts to 

provide more  than half the company's sales in the years ahead, up from

about 7 percent this year.

<P>

Crane, majority shareholder in the company, said it's not the money that 

is driving him any longer. "I like the business, I'm not that old and it's been fun. I'd like 

to see the thing stay stable and create opportunity for the rest of

the people in the company."

<P>

He wants Eagle to grow into a $1 billion company, which he figures will

take six or seven years if it follows its steady growth pattern. "As long

as it is doing well, I'd like to run it."

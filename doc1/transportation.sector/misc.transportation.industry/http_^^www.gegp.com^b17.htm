GOLDEN EAGLE PROFITS UP OVER 120% FOR SIX MONTHS<br>

Houston, TX.  August  14, 1996.  Golden Eagle Group, Inc. (GEGP : NASDAQ)<br>
announced today that it will report net income of $596,404 or $.10 cents per share on<br>
revenues of approximately $17.73 million for the quarter ended June 30, 1996 as<br>
compared to net income of $283,254 or $.06 cents per share on revenues of<br>
approximately $12.53 million for the quarter ended June, 30, 1995, or an improvement of<br>
approximately 41.5% in revenues and 110.6% in net income.  Weighted average shares<br>
outstanding during the three months ended June 30, 1996 were 6,186,949 as compared to<br>
4,520,290 for the same period in 1995.<br>
<br>
The Company will report net income of $863,308 or $.15 cents per share on revenues of<br>
approximately $33.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 1996 as compared to net<br>
income of $388,956 or $.09 cents per share on revenues of approximately $23.77 for the<br>
six months ended June 30, 1995 or an improvement of approximately 40.3% and 122.0%<br>
in revenues and net income respectively.  Weighted average shares outstanding during<br>
the six months ended June 30, 1996 were 5,874,175 as compared to 4,522,407 for the<br>
same period in 1995.<br>
<br>
Results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 1996 include those of  World<br>
Trade Transport of Virginia, Inc. ("WTT"), which the Company acquired in July 1995.<br>
The increase in weighted average number of shares outstanding during the six months<br>
ended June 30, 1996 as compared to the same period in 1995 is attributable primarily to<br>
shares issued in connection with the acquisition.<br>
<br>
The Company attributes the increase in earnings primarily to much improved results<br>
from the Company's Laredo operations which were hit hard in January 1995 by the<br>
Mexican Peso devaluation combined with the results of WTT for the six months ended<br>
June 30, 1996.<br>

<B>Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements</B>
<P>
This MDU Resources Group, Inc. website contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements should be read with the cautionary statements and important factors as discussed below. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical fact, including without limitation those that are identified by the use of the words "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "predicts" and similar expressions.
<P>
The Company is including the following cautionary statement to make applicable and to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company.  Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions (many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions) and other statements which are other than statements of historical facts.  From time to time, the Company may publish or otherwise make available forward-looking statements of this nature.  All such subsequent forward-looking statements, whether written or oral and whether made by or on behalf of the Company, are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements.  
<P>
 Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed.  The Company's expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and are believed by the Company to have a reasonable basis, including without limitation management's examination of historical operating trends, data contained in the Company's records and other data available from third parties, but there can be no assurance that the Company's expectations, beliefs or projections will be achieved or accomplished.  Furthermore, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the Company's business or the extent to which any such factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.
<P>


<B>Regulated Operations--</B>
<P>
In addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere herein, some important factors that could cause actual results or outcomes for the Company and its regulated operations to differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements include prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions with respect to allowed rates of return, financings, or industry and rate structures, weather conditions, acquisition and disposal of assets or facilities, operation and construction of plant facilities, recovery of purchased power and purchased gas costs, present or prospective generation, wholesale and retail competition (including but not limited to electric retail wheeling and transmission costs), availability of economic supplies of natural gas, and present or prospective natural gas distribution or transmission competition (including but not limited to prices of alternate fuels and system deliverability costs).
<P>
<B>Non-regulated Operations--</B>
<P>
Certain important factors which could cause actual results or outcomes for the Company and all or certain of its non-regulated operations to differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements include the level of governmental expenditures on public projects and project schedules, changes in anticipated tourism levels, competition from other suppliers, oil and natural gas commodity prices, drilling successes in oil and natural gas operations, ability to acquire oil and natural gas properties, and the availability of economic expansion or development opportunities.
<P>
<B>Factors Common to Regulated and Non-Regulated Operations--</B>
<P>
The business and profitability of the Company are also influenced by economic and geographic factors, including political and economic risks, changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and policies, weather conditions, population growth rates and demographic patterns, market demand for energy from plants or facilities, changes in tax rates or policies, unanticipated project delays or changes in project costs, unanticipated changes in operating expenses or capital expenditures, labor negotiations or disputes, changes in credit ratings or capital market conditions, inflation rates, inability of the various counter parties to meet their obligations with respect to the Company's financial instruments, changes in accounting principles and/or the application of such principles to the Company, changes in technology and legal proceedings.

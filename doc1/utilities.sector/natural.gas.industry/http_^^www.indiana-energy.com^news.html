<H2>Indiana Energy, Inc. <BR>
Receives Favorable Ruling <BR>
Regarding ProLiance Energy, LLC
</H2>
<P>INDIANAPOLIS -- </B>On September 12, 1997, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission issued the decision in the complaint proceeding relating to the gas supply and portfolio administration agreements between ProLiance Energy, LLC and Indiana Gas Company, Inc. and ProLiance and Citizens Gas & Coke Utility.
The Commission concluded that these agreements are consistent with the public interest.
The management of Indiana Energy, Inc. believes that the decision is supportive of the utilities' relationship with ProLiance in all material respects.
ProLiance is an Indianapolis, Indiana based marketer of energy and related services and was formed in March of 1996 by affiliates of Indiana Energy and Citizens Gas.
<p>This decision is particularly important because the Commission has recognized that significant customer benefits can be achieved if utilities are encouraged to work toward innovative customer solutions in the changing energy marketplace.
As a result of ProLiance's provision of service to Indiana Gas and Citizens Gas, in excess of $50 million in gas costs savings will be realized for the customers of those utilities over the initial four and one-half year term of the utilities' agreements.  Further, the Commission has recognized that benefits for investors are appropriate when risks are being assumed by those investors.</p>

<p>As a result of this decision, Indiana Energy has determined that a substantial portion of the reserve it had previously recorded for earnings associated with ProLiance's gas supply and gas marketing business will be adjusted downward.  This will have the effect of increasing Indiana Energy's 1997 net income by approximately $3 million.</p>

<p>The Commission’s decision suggests that all material provisions of the agreements between ProLiance and the utilities are reasonable.  In the decision the Commission acknowledged that the utilities’ purchases of gas commodity from ProLiance at index prices, as compared to ProLiance’s actual cost, is not unreasonable.  The Commission also acknowledged that the amounts paid by ProLiance to the utilities for the prospect of using pipeline entitlements if and when they are not required to serve the utilities’ firm customers, and the fees paid by the utilities to ProLiance for portfolio administration services are not unreasonable.  Nevertheless, with respect to each of these matters, the Commission concluded that additional findings in the gas cost adjustment process would be appropriate and directed that these matters be considered further in the pending, consolidated gas cost adjustment proceeding involving Indiana Gas and Citizens Gas.  The Commission has not yet established a schedule for conducting these additional proceedings.</p>

<H2>Indiana Energy, Inc.<BR>
Announces Dividend Increase; Reports Consolidated Earnings
</H2>

<p>INDIANAPOLIS--The board of directors of Indiana Energy, Inc., the parent company of Indiana Gas Company, Inc. and other subsidiaries, today declared a cash dividend increase of 1 cent per share of common stock.  This 3.5-percent increase raises the quarterly dividend to 29 1/2 cents from 28 1/2 cents per share.   Fiscal year 1997 marks the 25th consecutive year that dividends paid to shareholders have increased.  The dividend is payable September 1, 1997, to shareholders of record August 15, 1997.</P>
<P>Indiana Energy, Inc. reported consolidated net income of $6.5 million for the third quarter of fiscal 1997, which ended June 30, 1997, as compared to net income of  $2.8 million for the same period in 1996.  Earnings per average common share for the current quarter were 29 cents, compared to 13 cents per share for the same quarter last year.  The 16-cent increase per share is primarily attributable to cooler weather and a gain on the sale of certain nonutility assets.</P>
<P>Net income for the 12 months ended June 30, 1997, was $42.2 million, compared to $43.9 million for the same period last year.  Earnings per share for the current 12 months were $1.87, compared to $1.95 per share for the same period last year.  The 8-cent decrease per share is due primarily to higher operating expenses, including depreciation and operation and maintenance.  Higher depreciation expense resulted from additions to utility plant to serve new customers and to maintain dependable service to existing customers.  Higher operation and maintenance expenses resulted in part from the acceleration of several distribution system maintenance projects into the last portion of fiscal year 1996.  The acceleration of these projects was made possible by higher earnings attributable to colder than normal weather during the 1996 heating season.  Despite weather 7 percent warmer than the same period last year, margin for the current 12 months remained approximately the same due to additions of new residential and commercial customers, as well as the recognition of revenues associated with the recovery of certain gas costs which had been recognized as expenses in the prior period.</P>

<H2>Indiana Energy, Inc.<BR>
Reports Consolidated Earnings; Dividend Unchanged
</H2>

<p>INDIANAPOLIS--Indiana
Energy, Inc., the parent company of Indiana Gas Company, Inc.
and other subsidiaries, reported consolidated net income of $24.3
million for the second quarter of fiscal 1997, which ended March
31, 1997, as compared to net income of  $26.2 million for the
same period in 1996.  Earnings per average common share for the
current quarter were $1.07, compared to $1.16 per share for the
same quarter last year.  The 9-cent decrease per share is primarily
attributable to weather 12 percent warmer than the same period
last year and 7 percent warmer than normal.  The effects of the
warmer weather were offset somewhat by lower operation and maintenance
expenses, as well as the addition of new  residential and commercial
customers.
<P>
Net income for the 12 months
ended March 31, 1997, was $38.5 million, compared to $45.3 million
for the same period last year.  Earnings per share for the current
12 months were $1.71, compared to $2.01 per share for the same
period last year.  The 30-cent decrease per share is primarily
attributable to weather 8 percent warmer than the same period
last year and 2 percent warmer than normal, offset somewhat by
the addition of new residential and commercial customers.  Higher
operation and maintenance expenses, resulting in part from the
acceleration of several distribution system maintenance projects
into the last half of fiscal year 1996, also contributed to the
decline in earnings for the period.  The acceleration of these
projects was made possible by higher earnings attributable to
colder than normal weather during the 1996 heating season.
<P>
The board of directors of
Indiana Energy today also declared a cash dividend of 28 1/2 cents
per share of common stock.  This is unchanged from the previous
quarter.  The dividend is payable June 1, 1997, to shareholders
of record May 15, 1997.

<H2>Indiana Energy, Inc.<BR>
Reports Consolidated Earnings
</H2>

<p>INDIANAPOLIS­­Indiana Energy, Inc., the parent company of Indiana Gas Company, Inc. and other subsidiaries, reported consolidated net income of $17.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 1997, which ended December 31, 1996, as compared to net income of $19.1 million for the same period in 1995. Earnings per average common share for the current quarter were 77 cents, compared to 85 cents per share for the same quarter last year. The 8-cent decrease per share is primarily attributable to normal weather for the quarter as compared to the prior year which was 9 percent colder than normal.
<p>Net income for the 12 months ended December 31, 1996, was $40.4 million, compared to $41.2 million for the same period last year. Earnings per share for the current 12 months were $1.79, compared to $1.83 per share for last year. The twelve-month earnings reflect increased margin attributable to weather that was 5 percent colder than normal as compared to the prior year which was about normal, and the addition of new customers. Nonutility income increased as well as a result of the operations of Indiana Energy's gas marketing affiliates. These increases, however, were offset by increased operating expenses, including the acceleration of several distribution system projects into fiscal 1996 permitted by higher earnings attributable to the colder than normal weather.

<H2>Outstanding Results,Future Planning Highlight Indiana Energy's Fiscal
Year</H2>

<P>INDIANAPOLIS - Fiscal year 1996 was one of the most outstanding years
in Indiana Energy, Inc.'s history. That was one of the messages Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer L.A. Ferger conveyed to shareholders
during the company's annual meeting today. Thanks to the coldest weather
in a decade and continued service area growth, Indiana Energy, the holding
company of Indiana Gas Company, Inc., experienced outstanding financial
performance. The following are highlights of Ferger's comments about the
fiscal year, which ended September 30, 1996: </P>

<UL>
<LI>The company earned record net income of $42 million, compared to $33
million in fiscal 1995, and record earnings of $1.87, compared to $1.46
the prior year (the previous record was $1.62 in 1993); </LI>

<LI>Margins increased from $185 million in fiscal 1995 to $210 million
this year; </LI>

<LI>Weather was 8 percent colder than normal and 25 percent colder than
fiscal 1995; </LI>

<LI>Return on equity was 14.6 percent, which not only exceeded the prior
year's ROE of 11.9 percent, but exceeded the average of a peer group of
utilities by 255 basis points; </LI>

<LI>The dividend paid was increased 3.6 percent; </LI>

<LI>There was a continued strong focus on managing Indiana Gas' core business;
and </LI>

<LI>ProLiance Energy, LLC, was formed as a strategic alliance with Citizens
Gas and Coke Utility of Indianapolis. ProLiance is primarily a natural
gas supply and gas marketing business that also supplies products and services
to other gas utilities and customers in Indiana and surrounding states.
In fiscal 1996, gas marketing affiliates contributed 8 percent to consolidated
net income. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Among the tough challenges faced by the company during fiscal 1996 were
two regulatory proceedings that may affect the formation, operation and
earnings of ProLiance. The company hopes to have a resolution of these
issues during the first half of calendar 1997. The company continues to
implement its program for investigating, and if necessary remediating former
manufactured gas plant sites and believes that the proceeds of insurance
settlements received to date will be adequate to fund its share of costs
presently incurred or expected to be incurred in connection with that program.
If future events require additional activities that are not presently foreseen,
adverse judicial and regulatory decisions, which are in various stages
of review or appeal, have limited the company's ability to recover the
costs of those additional activities from ratepayers or insurers. </P>

<P>Ferger also provided some insight on the future. &quot;Management,
as well as employees of the company, are confronting the challenge of making
sense of the future on a daily basis,&quot; said Ferger. &quot;In
order to excel in the evolving energy industry, we must focus on the key
areas of competition, customers, cost effectiveness and culture. We are
committed to identifying and meeting these challenges in a prudent, creative,
cost-effective manner, and to building the same shareholder value in the
future that we have in the past.&quot; </P>

<P>In a vote by shareholders, four directors were re-elected to three-year
terms. They are: Niel C. Ellerbrook, vice president, treasurer and chief
financial officer of Indiana Energy and senior vice president and chief
financial officer of Indiana Gas; Loren K. Evans, retired vice chairman

United Air Lines Maintenance Center; and Jean L. Wojtowicz, owner and president
of Cambridge Capital Management Corporation. </P>

<P>Following the shareholders' meeting, the board of directors elected
Niel C. Ellerbrook executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial
officer of Indiana Energy and executive vice president and chief financial
officer of Indiana Gas. The other current officers of Indiana Energy and
Indiana Gas were re-elected, and Robert E. Heidorn was elected assistant
secretary and deputy general counsel of both Indiana Energy and Indiana
Gas. </P>

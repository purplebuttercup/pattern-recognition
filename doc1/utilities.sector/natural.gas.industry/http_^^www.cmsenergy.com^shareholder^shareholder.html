<blockquote>

<p>You can reinvest your dividends directly to buy additional shares with no commision or service charge. </p>
<p>You receive dividend payments directly, not through a broker. </p>
<p>You receive important shareholder communications directly from CMS. </p>
<p>You can sell your stock directly through the company (10 cents per share commission). 
<p>You can own CMS common stock, an investment in a worldwide energy company, <b>or</b> Class G common stock, which reflects the performance of the Consumers Gas Group (the gas portion of CMS Energy's utility business). 
</p>

<h3>Automatic Investment</h3>
<p>You have three inexpensive ways to buy additional CMS Energy stock. Each option is commission-free, so you can invest the money you would otherwise pay in commissions, which maximizes your investment.
<ul>
<li> Reinvest dividends
<p>
<li> Send us a check to purchase more shares
<p>
<li> Automatic investment
</ul>
Automatic investment provides the following additional benefits: 

<blockquote>
<p><b>Convenience</b><br>
You can buy additional shares every month without mailing a check. Transfers are automatic. </p>
<p><b>Growth</b><br>
A regular, no-fee investment program is an excellent way to save for the future. Your investment builds automatically 
every month. </p>
<p><b>Security</b><br>
Automatic Investment eliminates the possibility of your mailed check being lost, delayed, or stolen. </p>
<p><b>Timing</b><br>
You maximize the use of your money. Automatic Investment doesn't transfer the funds out of your checking or savings 
account until the day before investment. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../images/dot_clear.gif" align=bottom hspace=5> </p>
<h3>Direct Dividend Deposit</h3>
<p>All of us want to get the full use of our investment dollars. So why wait for your dividend check? </p>
<p>CMS Energy offers a fast and efficient way to deliver your dividend: Direct Deposit. Instead of sending a check, we automatically deposit 
your dividend in your checking or savings account. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Speed</b><br>
Your dividends are sent electronically to your bank or credit union on the day of payment. Your money is in your 
account. Immediately. </p>
<p><b>Security</b><br>
Direct Deposit eliminates the risk of lost, delayed, or stolen checks. </p>
<p><b>Convenience</b><br>
You no longer have to make a special trip to the bank and stand in a long line to deposit your check. Your dividend is 
there, waiting for you. </p>
<p><b>Cost</b><br>
Best of all, this service is free. You get the speed, security, and convenience of Direct Deposit, at no cost to you. </p>

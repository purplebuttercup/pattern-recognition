CMS Gas Transmission and Storage Co. is building a new natural gas transportation service from the Chicago area to the Consumers Energy natural gas system in Michigan. The project also offers additional transportation options to eastern Canada and markets in the eastern U.S. 
<p>
The TriState Pipeline originates near Joliet, Illinois, at the terminus of new pipelines carrying gas supplies from western Canada, and extends eastward through northern Indiana to the Consumers Energy gas distribution system near White Pigeon, Michigan. From there, the new system expands the Consumers Energy system to deliver new supplies to multiple Michigan markets and ultimately as far east as Dawn, Ontario. 
<p>
Because transportation rates for the TriState Pipeline will be competitive with or lower than available alternatives, it offers an option to the proposed Vector pipeline. The new system will have a minimum capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day, expandable to one billion cubic feet per day. Its in-service target date is November 2000.  
<p>
CMS Gas Transmission and Storage is the project initiator, owns 66 2/3 percent of the project and will serve as managing partner. West Coast Energy (U.S.) Inc. will acquire a 33 1/3 percent ownership interest in TriState.
<p>
CMS Gas Transmission and Storage Co. is interested in potential shippers on the TriState Pipeline. For complete information on the open
season, call George Hass, (313) 436-9238, or Gary Skarb, (313) 982-8830.

Dear Shareholder:
<P> 
The Board of Trustees joins me in inviting you to attend Eastern's Annual
Meeting at 10:00 a.m. on Thursday, April 25, 1996 in the Auditorium of the
Bank of Boston, 100 Federal Street, Boston, Massachusetts.
<P> 
The accompanying Annual Report to Shareholders reports on the Company's
operations and outlook. The Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement
contain a description of the formal business to be acted upon by the
shareholders. At the meeting, we intend to continue our practice of discussing
Eastern's operating businesses and their prospects. Trustees, officers and
other executives, as well as representatives of Eastern's independent
accountants, will be available to answer any questions you may have.
<P> 
A proxy card and a postage-paid envelope are enclosed. Your vote,
regardless of the number of shares you own, is important. Whether or not you
plan to attend the meeting, I urge you to register your vote now by signing,
dating and returning the enclosed proxy card as soon as possible in the
envelope provided.
<P> 
I look forward to greeting personally as many shareholders as possible at
the meeting.
<P> 
Sincerely,<BR>

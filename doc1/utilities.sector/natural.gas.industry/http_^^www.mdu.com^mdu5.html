<P>

<UL>Marketing a new customer information system is a joint effort of the Black Hills Corporation and Montana-Dakota Utilities Co.  The two organizations have worked together to develop the new system each adding their extensive utility expertise to the process.
<P>
It all started in the fall of 1992.  Black Hills Corporation – the parent company of Black Hills Power and Light Company – determined they needed a new customer information system to replace their aging, mainframe-based customer information system (CIS).  They shopped around for a packaged solution but did not find a product that met their needs.  In the true spirit of an entrepreneur they took a bold step:  They built one. 
<P>
By May 1994, the new CIS was installed and operating in their Rapid City, South Dakota, offices.  The system was adaptable to the changing nature of the utility industry plus was relatively inexpensive.  Since nothing of its kind existed, Black Hills Corporation recognized the market potential of the product.  But in order to develop a system of full value, the CIS needed a component to handle natural gas customers.  Enter Montana-Dakota Utilities Co.  
<P>
Montana-Dakota was in the market for a new CIS and, like Black Hills Corporation, was unable to find a product that fit the company's specific requirements.  The two utilities had established alliances in other areas and discovered they could help each other in the development of CIS.  And the rest, as they say, is history.
<P>
The product is called DAKSOFT CIS.  Although the system may seem to be oriented to energy utilities, any company with a large customer base that is routinely billed is a potential buyer.  This includes cable television companies, water utilities and even telecommunications operations and Internet service providers.

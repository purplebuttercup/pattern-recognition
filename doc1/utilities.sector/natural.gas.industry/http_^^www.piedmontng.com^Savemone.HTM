<b><center><font size=+2>A Few Things To Consider<br>
When Buying Your Next Appliance.</b></center></font>

<p><b><font size=+3>E</b></font>ver consider using gas appliances instead of electric?  If you knew how much you could save with natural gas, you would.</p>

<p>Take gas water heaters: they heat water twice as fast for half the cost of electricity.  Gas dryers dry clothes faster than electric ones -- and cost 50% less to operate.  Gas ranges heat up faster, with precise control, and cost a third less to operate than electric ranges.  No wonder 97% of professional chefs prefer cooking with gas.</p>

<p>Just look for the symbol below at your local appliance dealer.  It means that dealer is one of our Cerfified Gas Appliance Dealers.  And it means they offer high-quality products with the latest in gas appliance technology and design.</p>

<p>So if you don't have all gas appliances, consider visiting a Certified Gas Appliance Dealer soon.  Because the more gas appliances you have, the more you'll save.</p>

<H6>Each listed dealer or contractor has represented to Piedmont Natural Gas Company that they are licensed by the North Carolina Licensing Board for General Contractors.  Every listed contractor is required by the state of North Carolina to maintain adequate insurance to cover the work that they perform and each must follow good business ethics with their work.  Piedmont Natural Gas Company provides this list of dealers and contractors for our customers' convenience; however, each is solely responsible for the services and products that they provide.  We suggest that you obtain at least two written bids for services to be rendered, and that you carefully consider any proposals and contracts that may be offered to you. As with any business with which you are not familiar, you may also want to check references with your local chapter of the Better Business Bureau.  We also recommend that you obtain appropriate consumer literature for additional information that may be useful to you in making your product or contractor/dealer selection decision.</H6></p>

<H6>Piedmont Natural Gas Company offers to our residential customers a finance program for natural gas equipment purchased and installed through Certified Gas Appliance Dealers, Participating Gas Heating Contractors and Participating Gas Plumbing Contractors.  With credit approval, our residential customers may finance a water heater or central heating system with a minimum of 5% down or other natural gas appliances with a minimum of 10% down.  All of the equipment may be financed for up to 60 months.  Equipment must have third party certification and be installed to meet or exceed state and local code requirements.  Contact your local Piedmont Natural Gas office for additional details.</H6>

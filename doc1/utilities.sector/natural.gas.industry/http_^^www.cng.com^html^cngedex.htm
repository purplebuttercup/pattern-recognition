<H2>How the CNG Energy Index Forecasts Home Energy Use</H2>

<P>  The CNG Energy Index is a new, better way to forecast and measure the weather's impact on residential energy requirements in 100 U.S. metropolitan areas.  
	Home owners can use the Index to help gauge their natural gas, electric or fuel oil bills. They also can use it as a reminder to take energy conservation steps.
	The Index will help the many energy traders, utility companies, factory owners and others who want to forecast local, regional and national demand for natural gas, 
electricity and other energy forms.
	The CNG Energy Index is unique because it takes into account, along with maximum and minimum outdoor temperatures, the impact of sunshine, humidity and the previous day's weather on heating and cooling requirements.  This provides a more accurate indication of energy requirements than the traditional method of using degree days, which relies only on temperatures. 
	It's not uncommon to see a 20 percent difference in heating or cooling energy needs for the same house on two different days, even though the average temperatures on those days were the same.  For example, if one winter day in the Northeast is cloudy and coming off a cold spell and the other day is sunny and follows a mild period, the 
first day would require much more energy to keep the house warm.
	Seven-day forecasts and previous-day actuals are prepared every day for 100 U.S. metropolitan areas, nine regions and the nation as a whole.  The Index forecasts and actuals are also compared with normals for each day.
<P>	The CNG Energy Index is a proprietary product of Pittsburgh-based CNG Energy Services Corporation, one of the nation's leading full-service energy marketers.  CNG Energy Services, a subsidiary of Consolidated Natural Gas Company,  provides electricity, natural gas and other energy forms along with related services to gas and electric utilities, factories and other medium- and large-size energy users.<BR>

<H2>How The CNG Energy Index Works</H2>

<P>	The CNG Energy Index is based on proprietary formulas developed for CNG Energy Services Corporation by Ross F. Meriwether, a nationally known, independent energy consultant who lives in San Antonio, Texas.   Mr. Meriwether is a fellow of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc., (ASHRAE) and holds ASHRAE's Distinguished Service Award.  
	Weather forecasts are provided by Weather Services Corporation, of Lexington, Mass., one of the nation's largest meteorological services.  Among the clients of Weather Services are <A HREF="http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wenerg1.htm">USA Today</A> and many of the biggest utility companies in the United States.
	CNG Energy Index formulas were derived from computer models of a typical house built to current construction standards.  The computer models take into account insulation characteristics and the effects of such things as lights, appliances, thermostat setbacks at night, the history of energy usage and actual weather data.  It was assumed that the homeowner heats or cools his home when indoor temperatures are below 73 degrees F or above 76 degrees F.
	The actual amount of natural gas, electricity and other energy forms used by a homeowner for heating and cooling depends on a number of factors.  For one thing, cooling equipment tends to be more efficient than heating equipment, meaning it needs less electricity or gas to produce the same level of thermal energy.  Other factors influencing energy consumption include thermostat settings, operating practices and construction characteristics of the home.

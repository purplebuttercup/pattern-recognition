<strong><font size=+1 color=#347235>Transco and AGL Resources Announce<BR>
Formation of Cumberland Pipeline Company</strong></FONT><p>




HOUSTON, December 19, 1996--Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco)
and <a href="www.aglr.com/index.htm">AGL Resources Inc.</a
href="www.aglr.com/index.htm"> have signed a letter of intent to form a joint
venture to be known as Cumberland Pipeline Company.  The transaction is subject
to various corporate and regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>
The 135-mile Cumberland pipeline will initially consist of existing pipeline
infrastructure owned by the two companies and extending from Transco's mainline
in Walton County, Ga., to <a href="www.aglc.com/index.htm">Atlanta Gas Light
Company's</a href="www.aglc.com/index.htm">  interconnect with East Tennessee
Natural Gas Company in Catoosa County, Ga.  The existing facilities will be
expanded northward into the state of Tennessee.  The pipeline will provide
service to Atlanta Gas Light Company, Chattanooga Gas Company and other markets
throughout the eastern Tennessee Valley.</p>
<p>
"We are very pleased to have formed an alliance with a company of the standing of
AGL Resources and we look forward to aggressively providing service to the
growing markets in Georgia and Tennessee," said Cuba Wadlington Jr., senior vice
president and general manager, Transco.  "Cumberland will enable both AGL
Resources and Transco to combine our marketing and regulatory expertise to form a
new customer-oriented pipeline supplier to the region."</p>
<p>
"Cumberland is uniquely positioned to provide additional competitive alternatives
for Atlanta, Chattanooga and others in a growing market," said David R. Jones,
president and chief executive officer of AGL Resources.  "We are pleased that we
have a partner with the experience to operate and market interstate pipeline
capacity successfully.  Together we will provide an unwavering commitment to
superior customer service."</p>
<p>
Projected to enter service by Nov. 1, 2000, Cumberland combines Transco's 27-mile
Suwanee lateral, extending from Walton County to Gwinnett County, Ga., and
Atlanta Gas Light Company's 108-mile mainline, extending from Gwinnett County to
Catoosa County.  Additional looping and compression will expand Cumberland's
capacity to approximately 450 million cubic feet per day.</p>
<p>
Expansion facilities will include an extension into the state of Tennessee to
provide direct service to Chattanooga Gas Company and other downstream
markets.</p>
<p>
To complement the Cumberland project, Transco will offer additional pipeline
capacity from the terminus of its existing Mobile Bay Lateral in Choctaw County,
Ala., to its interconnect with Cumberland at Transco's proposed Station 125 in
Walton County.</p>
<p>
Costs of the proposed joint venture have not been finalized. Affiliates of
Transco and AGL Resources will own 50 percent of the new interstate pipeline,
with an affiliate of Transco serving as the operator.</p>
<p>
Cumberland Pipeline Company plans to hold an open season in the summer of 1997. 
The project will be submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for
approval in the fourth quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>

gas pipeline system that extends from the Gulf of Mexico to New York City.  The

<p><font size=+2><em><strong>How we came to be ...</strong></em></FONT></p>

<p>CNG began almost 100 years ago when John D. Rockefeller's
Standard Oil Company first started transporting natural gas.
Standard's National Transit Company controlled rich natural gas
fields in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In 1898, Standard
organized The Hope Natural Gas Company to produce, gather and
transport this gas, and The East Ohio Gas Company to distribute
the fuel to Ohio's expanding towns and industries. Thus was
created an integrated system encompassing all facets of the gas
industry -- a system that grew into the Consolidated Natural Gas
Company of today.</p>

<p>By the 1940s, gas would be the key ingredient in at least
5,000 industrial processes. And with success came intensifying
government regulation. The Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935 required diversified holding companies such as Standard Oil
Company (New Jersey) to divest themselves of their public utility
subsidiaries. And in 1943 Standard spun off Consolidated to its
shareholders as a completely independent, fully-integrated
natural gas company. The new company -- with $211 million in
assets to serve 750,000 customers -- came into being at the heart
of World War II and served &quot;the Arsenal of Democracy.&quot;</p>

<p>After the war, came a &quot;Golden Age&quot; for natural gas.
CNG companies laid thousands of miles of new pipe to supply their
fast-growing, prosperous markets. In 1951, CNG and Texas Eastern
Transmission Corp. received international attention when they
opened one of the world's largest underground gas storage
facilities, the $40 million Oakford pool in western Pennsylvania.
By the mid-1960s, CNG's storage system was so large the company
began renting space to other gas utilities. Today, it is the
biggest in the nation.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the late 1960s, America faced an imminent energy
supply crisis, and CNG became one of the first to sound the
alarm. For the first time in its history, the company sent out
its sales force to teach conservation. It also accelerated its
drilling and lease acquisitions. Between 1968 and 1978, CNG would
spend more than $1 billion on new supply projects in the Gulf of
Mexico region and its home territory, the Appalachians.</p>

<p>Consolidated Natural Gas emerged from the energy crisis as one
of the most active gas and oil drillers in the country. More than
6 percent of the nation's natural gas consumers now received all
or part of their gas supplies from CNG. CNG first moved outside
its traditional service area in a major way by selling gas and
associated storage to pipelines and utilities serving the East
Coast.</p>

<p>The face of the industry marketplace changed again in the
1990s when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission began to
deregulate key parts of the natural gas industry. Soon to follow
would be parts of the electric industry. Now many consumers --
especially commercial and industrial customers -- can pick and
choose the most competitive price for their energy source. To
meet this need, CNG Energy Services was established in 1993 and
began marketing electricity and natural gas throughout North
America. And we haven't stopped there. In 1996, CNG International
was established to extend our reach to participate in selected
international markets.</p>


<p><font size=+2><em><strong>In closing ...</strong></em></font></p>

<p>In 1898 we were providing natural gas to heat homes and fuel
industries in northeastern Ohio. Today we are providing energy
solutions to people throughout the United States and even
overseas. It's a changed marketplace, but our commitment to our
customers' needs remains constant. Thank you for taking the time
to read about our company and our success. </p>

	<dt><dd>
	I am very pleased to tell you about fiscal year 1996 - one of the most outstanding years in Indiana
	Energy's 51-year history.  Benefiting from the coldest weather in a decade and
	by growing and managing our core gas
	distribution business and related gas marketing business, we realized
	superior financial results.  We also made progress in dealing with the
	future of the evolving energy industry.  While we are proud of our past and
	current accomplishments,
	it is the future upon which we all must focus.
	This led us to the theme of this annual report - "The Future:  Making Sense
	of It All."  Before we look to the future, though, let's take a look at
	fiscal 1996 financial and operating highlights.
	<dt>
	<dd>
 	In fiscal 1996, we realized record net income and record earnings per
	share (EPS).  Net income was $42 million, compared to nearly $33 million in
	fiscal 1995.  EPS were $1.87 versus $1.46 last year.  The previous record
	for EPS was $1.62 in 1993.  Our return on equity of 14.6 percent
	significantly exceeds last year's ROE of 11.9 percent.  To establish and
	measure performance, we compare ourselves to a group of nearly 30 peer
	companies - local distribution companies selected by an independent
	investment banking firm.  In fiscal 1996, the estimated average ROE
	achieved by our peers was 11.8 percent.

	<img src="letter/elipse.jpg" align=right alt src="In fiscal '96 we realized record net income, record EPS,
	record dividend paid and an outstanding ROE.">

	<dt>
	<dd>
	Because of the current and future outlook for company earnings, Indiana
	Energy's board of directors increased the quarterly dividend in July 1996
	from 27 1/2 cents per common share to 28 1/2 cents per share.  This
	3.6-percent increase brought the year's dividend paid to a record $1.11,
	or $1.14 annualized.  This is the 24th consecutive year that we increased
	dividends paid.
	<dt>
	<dd>
	Several factors contributed to our ability to achieve these outstanding
	results:
	<ul>
		<li> Weather that was 8 percent colder than normal.  This is a marked
		contrast to fiscal 1995, when weather was 13 percent warmer than
		normal;

		<li>The continued strength of our service area economy, which netted
		more than 10,000 new residential and commercial customers and
		a 6.3-percent increase in industrial gas throughput;
	
		<li>A continued strong focus on managing Indiana Gas' core business; and

		<li>Gas marketing affiliates that contributed 8 percent to consolidated net
		income.
	</ul>

	
	<img src="letter/fitter.jpg" align=right alt src="Fitter Pat Norton and Fitter/Welder dough Shepherd
	help ensure safe, reliable service to new and existing customers.">


	<dt>
	<dd>
	We believe that our incentive compensation plans were also a key in our
	ability to achieve these outstanding results.  Bargaining and
	non-bargaining employees companywide received maximum payout through our
	Performance Incentive Plan because of their dedication and hard work in the
	areas of customer service, safety, cost control and achieving the
	above-average ROE.  Likewise, our management incentive compensation program is linked to achieving 
	corporate goals, including return on equity and increased shareholder value.
	<dt>
	<dd>
	The increased margin resulting from the very cold weather allowed us
	to accelerate some projects that will help us maintain and strengthen our
	distribution system.  It also means we increased our operation and
	maintenance (O & M) expenditures from last year's levels.  You may recall
	that last year's operating expenses were held well below budgeted levels to
	offset margins lost due to the extremely warm weather.  Despite the
	11.3-percent increase in O & M this year, we remain committed to
	controlling these costs.  While weather may cause year-to-year
	fluctuations, long-term, we plan to limit annual expense growth to an
	average annual rate below the Consumer Price Index.
	<dt>
	<dd>
	Our total return for fiscal year 1996 was about 18 percent, and for the
	five-year period ending in 1996 it was about 75 percent.  Although these
	returns are good, relative weakness in our stock price at fiscal year end
	brought our returns to less than the averages for our peer group of nearly 30 companies. 
	Over the last 10 years, the total return earned for our shareholders ranks us fourth
	out of the nearly 30 companies.  As I will discuss in the remainder of my letter,
	I believe our strategy should help return our performance to the outstanding level we have 
	achieved in the past.
	<dt>
	<dd>
	We believe we are positioned to exceed the industry
	average for dividend growth.  Some analysts are projecting
	2 1/2 - to 3-percent average dividend growth this coming year.  We're
	optimistic about our performance for several reasons: our growing and
	diverse service area; a supportive regulatory climate; competitive prices;
	our proven ability to
	control costs over time; and an historically conservative dividend payout

	<img src="letter/pipe.jpg" align=right alt src="Installing and maintaining pipe helped Indiana Energy continue 
	its outstanding performance.">

	ratio that has enabled the company to increase dividends paid year after year.

	<dt>
	<dd>
	The continuously changing energy industry requires us
	to be thughtful and creative about how we will grow the company,
	differentiate ourselves from other utility investments and increase
	investor value.  So now, let me share with you what we have been doing and
	here we are heading.

	Competition...Customers...Cost Effectiveness...Culture.
	<br>
	These four words, dubbed the "4 Cs," represent the key areas upon which
	Indiana Energy and its primary subsidiary, Indiana Gas, must focus in order
	to excel in the evolving utility industry.  While we have been working to
	understand industry changes the past couple of years, this year has brought
	an increased sense of urgency.  It has also led us to these four key areas.
	One thing the accelerating industry change has not done is change the
	company's mission or its basic business of providing natural gas and
	related services to customers.  We are still committed to maximizing return

	<img src="letter/busenvir.jpg" align=right img alt="Brian Azman and Stephanie Dalton, of ProLiance Energy,
	are helping position Indiana Energy for the new business environment.">


	to investors, commensurate with business risks, by providing long-term
	value to our customers through safe, reliable, low-cost products and
	services.  We will accomplish this through our employees and by supporting
	the communities where we live and work.

	<dt>
	<dd>
	While the basic mission hasn't really changed, we have had to change the
	ways we look at and operate our core gas distribution business as the
	industry becomes increasingly deregulated and, as a result, more
	competitive.
	
	<dt>
	<dd>
	In order to be competitive and successful, Indiana Gas can't rely on
	simply being able to deliver natural gas to its residential, commercial and
	industrial customers, bill them and then collect from them.  Indeed, we
	have continued to introduce expanded service options to more customers.
	Our larger-volume industrial and commercial customers, for example, now
	choose which services they receive and from whom they receive them.  This
	is what's known as unbundled service or customer choice.

	<dt>
	<dd>
	But being successful in the future entails more than developing unbundled
	services.  It requires a recognition of where the industry is heading and a
	willingness to change thinking and approaches to business.  It also
	requires that the company be proactive, rather than reactive.  And that's
	exactly what we're doing.

	<A NAME="competition">
	<font size=+2 color="#006633"><i><b>Competition</b></i></font>

	<dt><dd>
	Competition in the utility industry is real and is here to stay.  It seems
	that every week there's word of another utility merger or strategic
	alliance.  Independent energy marketing companies have become an important
	part of the landscape.  For Indiana Energy, competition is one of the
	primary drivers in the company's decision-making process.

	<dt>
	<dd>
	Competition in the gas business exists in several forms.  There's

	<img src="letter/elipse2.jpg" align=right alt src="customers must find choices easy to understand with
	identifiable, achievable benefits.">

	competition for gas transportation load, and competition for the sale of
	the commodity to local distribution companies, like Indiana Gas, and to end-use customers.
	Competition continues to exist between natural gas and other energy sources
	such as electricity and oil.  We expect competitive pressures will build as
	the electric industry continues to restructure.
	<dt>
	<dd>
	About half of Indiana Gas' throughput is already open to transportation
	service.  We believe that even the smallest of our customers would like to
	be able to choose their gas supplier (much like they choose their long
	distance phone service provider), and take advantage of competition just as
	many of our larger customers already do.  However, we also believe that the
	transition to full customer choice needs to be managed so that it is
	offered in an easily understood manner, with benefits that are clearly
	identifiable and readily achievable.
	<dt>
	<dd>
	Our efforts to be successful in the short- and long-term include
	several different initiatives.  The formation of a strategic alliance with
	Citizens Gas and Coke Utility of Indianapolis this year is one example of
	Indiana Energy positioning itself for this new business environment.  This
	new entity, ProLiance Energy, LLC, was formed to optimize the gas
	acquisition and supply resources of both companies.  Its goal is to provide
	reliable energy solutions at more competitive prices than Indiana Gas is
	able to offer on its own in a niche market that includes Indiana and
	surrounding states.
	<dt>
	<dd>
	However, the formation and operations of ProLiance have been challenged in
	hearings before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC).  Details
	on the challenge can be found on page 12.  We believe that ProLiance is a
	reasonable response to the changing utility marketplace, and that it
	accomplishes several important objectives, including:
	<ul>
		<li>Indiana Gas and its customers are shielded from the risk of paying above-market prices;
		<li>Indiana Gas and its customers have experienced immediately reduced gas costs and, 
			over the next few years, have the potential for further substantial reductions;
		<li>ProLiance ensures the presence of an Indiana-based provider of service
			that can compete with marketers for gas sales to end users, and that will be a
			long-term gas supply option available to customers, of all sizes, at a competitive
			cost; and
		<li>ProLiance provides an opportunity for Indiana Energy to be financially rewarded
			for the assumption of risks associated with the provision of gas supply.
	</ul>We hope to have a decision from the IURC during the first half of calendar 1997.
	
	<img src="letter/maximize.gif" align=right img src="Maximizing gas supply and related resources
	is a key reason for the formation of ProLiance Energy, a new strategic alliance.">
	
	<dt>
	<dd>
	How the IURC addresses the issues related to ProLiance and to the
	competitive utility environment is very important to us, all of our
	customers and stakeholders and many others in the industry.  We strongly
	believe that to be competitive in the future, we'll need to replace the
	traditional cost-of-service regulation with performance-based regulation.
	We need ratemaking that encourages and rewards rigorous cost management and
	risk-taking, while ensuring quality customer service.  Indiana has a state
	law that allows for innovative approaches to regulation for gas and
	electric utilities.
	
	<dt>
	<dd>
	We expect to move toward performance-based regulation, or PBR, in the
	future.  We believe that incentives work in a competitive marketplace.  And
	through PBR, we would seek to create a balance between customer service and
	the financial objectives embodied in many cost control measures.

	Consumers are the spark driving the fierce competition.  As we have seen in
	other industries that are now deregulated, such as telecommunications,
	banking, railroads and airlines, competition creates the power of customer
	choice.  We believe that energy customers will expect unmatched value and
	more for less (much like buying food, clothing and long distance phone

	service) in this new competitive environment.  This means the company must
	continue providing safe, reliable, low-cost products and services.
	However, while low cost has been, and will likely continue to be,
	important, we believe that value and service are also extremely important.

	<dt>
	<dd>
	In 1996, we know that customers in all classes are pleased with the
	products and services they receive from Indiana Gas.
	In fact, our annual customer opinion survey shows steady increases in
	residential customer satisfaction the past three years.  Surveys of other
	customer groups mirror that positive result.  We feel so strongly about
	customer service that it's one  of the three components of our companywide
	incentive compensation plan.

	<dt>
	<dd>
	Indiana Gas continues to realize strong customer and load growth in
	the residential, commercial and industrial sectors.  Customer additions
	continue at about 2<font size=-1>1/2</font> percent annually.  Industry growth 
	averages about 2 percent.  We are confident that our market will provide 
	the opportunities to realize solid future growth.

	<dt>
	<dd>
	One of the reasons we remain optimistic is the ongoing economic expansion
	and strength of our existing service area.  Indiana Gas serves an area that
	includes 281 communities in 48 of Indiana's 92 counties, with a population
	of about 2 million.  We reach from the Ohio to Illinois borders.  We serve
	communities along the Ohio River in southern Indiana and communities
	through north central Indiana.
	A unique distribution center with 60 percent of the U.S. population within
	a day's drive, Indiana Gas' market is truly at the "crossroads of America."

	<dt>
	<dd>
	Overall, the Indiana economy, as well as that of the Midwest, continues to
	outperform the national economy.  Various economic indicators for a recent
	12-month period show continued growth in the industrial sector, total
	construction, housing starts and retail sales.  Seasonally adjusted
	unemployment rates average in the range of 4.1 to 4.3 percent.

	<dt>
	<dd>
	In addition to our outstanding location and strong economy, our
	customer base is diverse and growing.  It includes agriculture, automotive
	and steel production, pharmaceutical, glass and food producers, among other
	industries.

	<dt>
	<dd>
	While customers are satisfied with Indiana Gas products and services,
	we can't rest on our laurels.  To achieve outstanding financial
	performance, we are focused on profitable customer growth and customer
	needs.  We want to know and understand even more about our customers' needs
	even though in Indiana, there are no regulatory mandates to offer choices
	or unbundled service.

	<dt>
	<dd>
	Indiana Gas has chosen to be proactive in this regard.  Indiana Gas
	currently offers unbundled service to customers using as little as 5,000
	dekatherms a year.  Customers representing about half of our load can
	purchase gas from Indiana Gas or a third party.

	<dt>
	<dd>
	During the first half of fiscal 1997, the company plans to file a request
	with the IURC for a new pilot program to further test the market and gain
	additional experience at providing unbundled service to smaller-sized
	
	<img src="letter/quadelip.jpg" align=right alt src="we are focused on profitable cusomer growht and meeting 
	customer needs.">

	customers.  During the pilot, aggregated load transportation would be offered to a group of small
	commercial customers.

	<dt>
	<dd>
	In addition, we see this time as an outstanding opportunity to develop new
	energy-related products and services.  A management team is creating a
	process for identifying and evaluating new business opportunities.  It will
	also search for earnings growth opportunities we might pursue.  We will
	have results from this effort to incorporate into our fiscal 1998 planning
	cycle.


	<dt>
	<dd>
	Strong communities result in a good business environment for us.
	Recognizing this, we actively support the cities and towns where we live,
	work or provide service.  In fiscal 1996, we formed the Indiana Energy
	Foundation to assist in these efforts.  Through the foundation we provide
	financial support to organizations and activities that meet certain
	criteria.

	<dt>
	<dd>
	We also encourage employees to volunteer their time and energy to
	community activities and needs.  Our "Partners in Community Business
	Retention and Expansion" program continues to assist local communities with
	economic development-related issues.

	<dd>
	Cost effectiveness is not a new idea at Indiana Energy.  Its importance is 
	well known, and it's integrated into the company's ongoing business strategy.  
	Employees are encouraged to look for opportunities to operate more efficiently and 
	cost effectively in their daily routines and responsibilities.

	<dt>
	<dd>
	To provide customers with more for less, the company uses process
	improvement and activity-based management techniques to better understand
	the costs of processes and services, to identify room for improvement and
	to generate savings.  These also will help determine what it takes to be
	competitive in the marketplace and in which areas we can and cannot be successful.
	Performance-based regulation would also provide incentives for the company
	to continue to generate cost savings to share with customers and
	shareholders.

	<dt>
	<dd>
	Information technology plays an increasingly important role in our ability
	to be competitive and operate cost effectively.  Indiana Gas has a
	comprehensive information technology plan to update its existing
	infrastructure and to implement several major new systems.  We're making a
	significant investment to adapt and implement an integrated customer
	information and work management system.  This new system, which will be on
	line the summer of 1998, will allow employees to collect, better manage and
	study important customer information, to track and manage customer choice
	programs and to improve customer service.  We're
	also continuing to test mobile data dispatching technology, which allows
	service specialists to receive and send customer information via personal
	computers in their trucks.  This makes us more efficient and helps us deliver better
	service to customers.


	<dt>
	<dd>
	Information technology also will give us the ability to expand our
	customer base cost effectively with the same number or fewer employees.  It
	also allows for more timely communication with various audiences.  Both
	Indiana Energy and Indiana Gas have World Wide Web sites on the Internet.
	Indiana Energy's site, located at http://www.indiana-energy.com, features
	information of particular interest to shareholders and financial analysts.
	Indiana Gas' site at http://www.indiana-gas.com contains more general
	company, product and educational information.  An internal Web site, or
	Intranet, is currently being tested within Indiana Gas.

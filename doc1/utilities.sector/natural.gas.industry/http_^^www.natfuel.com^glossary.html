<strong>Bcf</strong> - Billion cubic feet<p>

<strong>Bundled Service</strong> - Providing a unit of gas to the 
customer at a price that includes the cost of gas and all associated 
transportation, balancing and storage costs to deliver it.<p>

<strong>Condensate</strong> - A liquid hydrocarbon, normally oil, 
recovered at the surface as natural gas is produced.<p>

<strong>Decatherm</strong> - A heating value of 1,000,000 British thermal 
units, approximately equal to 1 Mcf.<p>

<strong>Degree Day</strong> - A measure of the coldness of the weather 
experienced, based on the extent to which the daily average temperature 
falls below a reference temperature, usually 65 degrees Fahrenheit.<p>

<strong>Discovery Well</strong> - A successful well drilled in a new 
field.<p>

<strong>Hedging</strong> - A method of minimizing the impact of price 
changes.<p>

<strong>Horizontal Drilling</strong> - A drilling technique in which the 
well bore runs horizontal or parallel to the earth's surface. This 
exposes a greater portion of the underground producing rock formation to 
the well bore than conventional vertical d



rilling, improving overall productivity by permitting maximum recovery 
from a reservoir.<p>

<strong>Hub</strong> - Location where pipelines intersect enabling the 
trading, transportation, storage, exchange and lending of natural gas.<p>

<strong>Market-Based Rates</strong> - Rates set, by class or 
individually, against the price of the next available competitive 
alternative.<p>

<strong>Mbbl</strong> - Thousand barrels.<p>

<strong>Mcf</strong> - Thousand cubic feet<p>

<strong>MMcf</strong> - Million cubic feet<p>

<strong>MMcfe</strong> - Million cubic feet equivalent ( 1 barrel of oil 
= 6 Mcf of gas ).<p>

<strong>Recompletion</strong> - Plugging the existing zone and begin 
production from another zone.<p>

<strong>Reserves</strong> - Estimated volumes of oil, gas or other 
minerals that can be recovered from deposits in the earth with reasonable 
certainty.<p>

<strong>Seismic Technology</strong> - The use of sound waves to chart 
sub-surface formations in order to evaluate prospects for drilling. 
Current technology provides enhanced 3-D mapping which greatly improves 
the chances for success.<p>

<strong>Throughput</strong> - The sum of volumes of gas sold and volumes 
of gas transported for customers.<p>

<strong>Transition Costs</strong> - Costs being passed on to utilities 
from interstate pipeline companies as a result of the federally-mandated 
restructuring of the natural gas pipeline industry.<p>

<strong>Transportation Gas</strong> - The movement of gas for third 
parties through pipeline facilities for a fee.<p>

<strong>Unbundled Service</strong> - The separation of services, such as 
transportation, storage and gathering, with rates charged that reflect 
cost of each service.<p>

<strong>Underground Storage</strong> - The injection of large quantities 
of natural gas into underground rock formations for storage during 
periods of low market demand and withdrawl during periods of high market 
demand.<p>

<strong>Weather Normalization</strong> - A clause in utility rates which 
adjusts customer costs to reflect normal temperatures. If temperatures 
during the measured period are warmer than normal, customers receive a 
surcharge. If temperatures during the me



asured period are colder than normal, customers receive a credit.<p>

<strong>Workover</strong> - Stimulating or remedial operations in the 
existing production zone of an oil or gas well.<p>

<center><font size=4><b>CONVERSION FACTORS</b></font><p>
<font size=3>The following are the units of measure and natural gas 
equivalents in British thermal units (Btu).<p>

One Btu is the quantity of heat necessary to raise the temperature of one 
pound of water one degree Fahrenheit from 58.5 to 59.5 degrees under 
standard pressure of 30 inches of mercury at or near its point of 
maximum  density.  One Btu equals 252 calories



, 778 foot pounds, 1,055 joules or 0.293 watt hours.<p></font>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><b>
1 cubic foot (cf)               = 1,000 Btu<p>
1 therm = 100 cf                = 100,000 Btu<p>
1 Mcf = 1,000 cf                = 1 million Btu<p>
1 Bcf = 1 Billion cf    = 1 trillion Btu<p>
1 Tcf = 1 Trillion cf   = 1 quad = 1 quadrillion Btu<p>

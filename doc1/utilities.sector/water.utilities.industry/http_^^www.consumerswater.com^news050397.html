LONDONDERRY, May 3, 1997 -- Consumers New Hampshire Water Company (CNHWC) will promote the importance of a safe, clean water supply at the Drinking Day Water Fair on May 6 at Wheelock Park in Keene, NH from 8:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.

<BR> 
<P>
CNHWC, "The Source You can Depend On", will highlight its expertise and strong record of providing safe, clean water with an exhibit and activities for fourth and fifth grade students.

<BR> 
<P>
Sharon E. Schulman, president, CNHWC commented that only 1% of the world's water supply is actually available for all of humanity's needs.   "What we pour on the ground ends up in our water and what we discharge into air eventually ends up in our water," noted the CNHWC president.  "It's the responsibility of companies such as Consumers New Hampshire to clean that water so it can be ingested."

        <BR> 
<P>
CNHWC will enlist children as water conservationists by distributing "Blue Thumb" pledges.  Students will be asked to stamp their thumb prints on a Blue Thumb Pledge to conserve and protect our drinking water.


<BR> 
<P>
Kids who sign the Blue Thumb pledge will be asked to encourage their families and friends to help keep our water clean and save by:

Turning off the tap when you brush your teeth to safe 2 - 3 gallons of water a day.

Be a detective and check faucets for leaks. 
 
Fixing a slow drip can save 15 to 20 gallons a day.

Throw used facial tissues in the wastebasket instead of the toilet.

Keep used household batteries out of the trash and landfills.  They contain toxins that pollute water.  Take them to a recycling or collection center.

Use rechargeable batteries in games, portable radios and CD players to save money and the environment.
<BR> 
<P>

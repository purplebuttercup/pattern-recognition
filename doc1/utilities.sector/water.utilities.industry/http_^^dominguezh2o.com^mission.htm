<B><FONT SIZE=+3>D</FONT></B>ominguez Water was formed in 1911 to irrigate
the farmlands of the Rancho San Pedro, the first Spanish Land Grant in
the South Bay area of Los Angeles County. Back then, Dominguez provided
a few thousand gallons per day with one artesian well, steam-engine powered
pumps, and redwood pipes. 
<P>Today, Long Beach-based Dominguez Water Company is the largest subsidiary
of Dominguez Services Corporation. The utility provides up to 50 million
gallons per day to business and residential customers, utilizing local
groundwater and water imported by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California from the State Water Project and the Colorado River. The company's
professional staff of engineers, operators, and service providers support
the operations of smaller subsidiaries in Kern County and northern Los
Angeles County.<BR clear="left">

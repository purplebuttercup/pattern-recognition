Following a         competitive bid process, the partnership was awarded the         contract to operate Indianapolis' two wastewater plants.         These facilities process 250 million gallons a day (mgd) of         city sewerage and stormwater. Two years later, the         partnership won a second contract to operate the wastewater         collection system. The Harvard Business Review recently         cited the project as a successful example of private         industry doing business with government.</FONT></P>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial"         COLOR="#996600"><IMG SRC="IMAGES/municipal/finfocus.gif"         WIDTH=126 HEIGHT=24 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight         ALIGN=bottom><BR>                  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1"         FACE="Helvetica, Arial">Indianapolis had enjoyed relatively         low sewer rates, averaging $7.71/monthly for homeowners, and         had not increased rates since 1985. However, the aging         collection system and necessary plant maintenance items were         forcing a potential 33 percent increase in 1993. Savings         from the operations and maintenance contract assured the         city that a rate increase would not be necessary.</FONT>         </P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial">WREP's operation         of the city's advanced wastewater treatment plants was         projected to save $65 million over the life of the contract,         as compared to the city's former annual budget of $30         million. To date, the savings in the first three years are         ahead of original projections and total $46 million, roughly         40 percent less cost than former city operations. The second         contract for the collection system saved the city $2.6         million for the first year of performance.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial">In October 1997,         the city signed a letter of intent to extend both contracts         for an additional 10 years. Savings over the life of the         contracts are projected to reach about $250 million.</FONT>         </P>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial"         COLOR="#996600"><IMG SRC="IMAGES/municipal/emphempl.gif"         WIDTH=188 HEIGHT=26 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight         ALIGN=bottom><BR>                  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial">The         WREP/Indianapolis employee transition program has been         lauded by the American Federation of State, County and         Municipal Employees (AFSCME) as a model of union relations         within the public-private partnership framework. In fact,         during the first year of the contract, union grievances         dropped from 38 to one. AFSCME, WREP and city         representatives have been invited to speak on the success of         the project at state, national and international         forums.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial">Under the city's         management, 322 employees operated the plants. The United         Water team interviewed 317 of these, hired 196, and assisted         the remaining 126 in finding new employment. The majority         were hired by the city into comparable positions. The         remainder were placed through a city Safety Net program and         an Outplacement Assistance Program.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial">Current plant         employees are cross-trained and developed within the partner         companies to cultivate high-quality job performance. To this         end, the team established both intensive plant-wide safety         programs and the International Center for Training and         Development where employees of any of the WREP partner         companies can learn more about management issues,         technology, and industry developments.</FONT></P>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial"         COLOR="#996600"><IMG SRC="IMAGES/municipal/commconn.gif"         WIDTH=189 HEIGHT=28 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight         ALIGN=bottom><BR>                  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial">The         United Water team actively contributes to the Indianapolis         community. Larger government contracts were broken down into         smaller components with prompt payments. This allowed         smaller local businesses to participate in the new project.         More than 20 percent of the Indianapolis project's goods and         services have been purchased through women-owned and/or         minority-owned businesses. This is nearly twice the target         rate of the contract agreement.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial">The partnership         also provides educational and employment opportunities for         students at Arlington High School. WREP has also initiated a         school-wide career development program. Other community         activities include participation with environmental and         civic groups such as Friends of the White River, Project         Insite, United Way, Indiana Environmental Institute, Indiana         Black Expo, Youthlinks, and joint sponsorship of an auto         racing team with AFSCME Local 725. Environmentalists and         local union leaders, who originally opposed the transition         to private management, are now among the project's strongest         supporters.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial">"The taxpayers         have clearly won," says Indianapolis Mayor Stephen         Goldsmith, who plans to invest the savings into the city's         massive infrastructure renewal program. "The water quality         has been equivalent or better than we enjoyed historically -         and all at 40 percent less than the city was spending         before."</FONT></P>                  <P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Helvetica, Arial">         <HR WIDTH=420>         </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"         FACE="Helvetica, Arial"><A HREF="default.html">home</A></FONT><FONT         SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial"> | </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"         FACE="Helvetica, Arial"><A HREF="whoare.htm">who we         are</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial"> |         </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"         FACE="Helvetica, Arial"><A HREF="whatdo.htm">what we         do</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial"> |         </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"         FACE="Helvetica, Arial"><A HREF="investor.htm">investor         info</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial"> |         </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"         FACE="Helvetica, Arial"><A HREF="municpal.htm">municipal         info</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial"> |         </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"         FACE="Helvetica, Arial"><A HREF="news.htm">news</A></FONT><FONT         SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial"> | </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"         FACE="Helvetica, Arial"><A HREF="search.htm">search</A></FONT>         </CENTER>      </TD><TD WIDTH=50>         <P>      </TD><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=140>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0         WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=155>            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=29>                  <P ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF="whoare.htm"><IMG                  SRC="IMAGES/municipal/button1.GIF" ALT="who we are"                  WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=29 X-SAS-UseImageWidth                  X-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=0 ALIGN=top></A>               </TD></TR>            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=31>                  <P ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF="whatdo.htm"><IMG                  SRC="IMAGES/municipal/button2.GIF" ALT="what we do"                  WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=31 X-SAS-UseImageWidth                  X-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=0 ALIGN=bottom></A>               </TD></TR>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=32>                  <P ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF="investor.htm"><IMG                  SRC="IMAGES/municipal/button3.GIF"                  ALT="investor info" WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=32                  X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=0                  ALIGN=bottom></A>               </TD></TR>            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=31>                  <P ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF="news.htm"><IMG                  SRC="IMAGES/municipal/button4.GIF" ALT="news"                  WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=31 X-SAS-UseImageWidth                  X-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=0 ALIGN=top></A>               </TD></TR>            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=32>                  <P ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF="search.htm"><IMG                  SRC="IMAGES/municipal/button5.GIF" ALT="search"                  WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=32 X-SAS-UseImageWidth                  X-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=0 ALIGN=top></A>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></P></BODY></HTML>

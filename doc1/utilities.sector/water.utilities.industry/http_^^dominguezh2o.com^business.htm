<P><B><FONT SIZE="+3">D</FONT></B>ominguez has put state-of-the-art technologies
to work to ensure success in the areas of groundwater development and water
treatment. </P>

<P>In the South Bay area of Los Angeles County, Dominguez adds one million
gallons of water per day to its supply through use of a reverse-osmosis
desalination facility. In Kern County, Dominguez utilizes leading-edge
technologies, including filtration and polymer-injection, to provide a
high quality water supply. And, to treat supplies in all of its water systems,
Dominguez uses on-site chlorine generators, a method which is safer and
less expensive than traditional chlorination methods.<BR clear="right">

Other technologies increasing Dominguez' operational efficiency include:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Computer monitoring of tank levels, well production, and system controls
(SCADA) </LI>

<LI>Linked data and network systems, including integrated computer-aided
drafting and design (CADD) </LI>

offers two more resources through partnership: extensive water rights holdings
and investment capital. The company, which was formed in 1911, has extensive
water rights in the South Bay area of Los Angeles County. This asset has
given management valuable expertise in brokering water rights. </P>

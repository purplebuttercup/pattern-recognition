        have to think about drinking water.<p><b>REALITY</b> - We
        can not longer take our drinking water for granted.
        Public participation is vital to protecting out water
        resources, building adequate treatment plants, improving
        water delivery, analyzing costs versus risks, and
        enacting appropriate legislation.</p>

        <p><b>MYTH</b> - There are more pollutants in drinking
        water today than there were 25 years ago.</p>
        <p><b>REALITY</b> - Not necessarily. There may be more
        contaminants that can enter our water sources today. We
        did not have the technology to know what was in our
        drinking water 25 years ago. Today we have sophisticated
        testing instruments that enable us to know more about our
        water than ever before. With this knowledge, the drinking
        water community is taking steps to treat what's in our
        water, to curb the flow of pollution, and keep our water
        safe and wholesome.</p>
        <hr width="75%">
        <p><b>MYTH</b> - We have less water today than we did 100
        years ago.</p>
        <p><b>REALITY</b> - There is the same amount of water on
        Earth today as there was three billion years ago. The
        difference is that today many more demands are placed on
        the same amount of water. These increased demands have,
        in a sense, created a different kind of water: water that
        is regulated, treated and sold. Because our demands on
        water continue to grow, but our supplies don't , drinking
        water counts on everyone lending a hand to conserve,
        protect and get involved with decision that affect our
        water resources.</p>

        - Once you use water, it's gone.</p>
        <p><b>REALITY</b> - After water is used, it's
        recycled.....innumerable times. Some water is recycled
        for use within a week, other water may not be used again
        for years.</p>
        <hr width="75%">
        <p><b>MYTH</b> - Water is fragile and will be ruined by
        so much use.</p>
        <p><b>REALITY</b> - Water is resilient and responds well
        to treatment. However, using water and abusing water by
        contaminating lakes, streams and wells with toxic
        chemicals are two different things. To keep our drinking
        water safe, we need not only appropriate treatment, but
        also appropriate source protection.</p>
        <hr width="75%">
        <p><b>MYTH</b> -<i> &quot;New&quot;</i> water is better
        than treated water.</p>
        <p><b>REALITY</b> - There is very little water on Earth
        that is <i>&quot;new&quot;</i>. Most of our water has
        been touched by some type of human or animal activity.
        Even in <i>&quot;pristine&quot;</i> wilderness areas,
        studies have found bacteria contaminating water.
        Therefore, it's always best to drink water<font
        face="Arial"> </font>that you know has been treated. </p>
        <hr width="75%">
        <p><b>MYTH</b> - Bottled water is safer that tap water.</p>
        <p><b>REALITY</b> - Not necessarily. The safety of
        bottled water and tap water initially depends on the
        source of the water. Monitoring and source protection,
        treatment and testing ultimately determine the quality of
        the finished product. In the United States, the 1996
        reauthorization of the Safe Drinking Water Act will
        require that bottled water be monitored and tested in the
        same rigorous manner that tap water has been subject to
        for years.</p>
        <hr width="75%">
        <p><b>MYTH</b> - Using a home water treatment device will
        make tap water safer or healthier to drink.</p>
        <p><b>REALITY</b> - Some people use home water filters to
        improve the taste, smell and/or appearance of their tap
        water, but it does not necessarily make the water safer
        or healthier to drink. Additionally, all home treatment
        devices, regardless of the technologies they use, require
        regular maintenance. If the maintenance is not performed
        properly, water quality problems may result.</p>
        <hr width="75%">
        <p><b>MYTH</b> - If lead is in your water, it's the
        utility's fault.</p>
        <p><b>REALITY</b> - The most common source of lead in
        drinking water is the plumbing in your home. Your
        plumbing may have lead pipes or lead solder in the
        connections. Lead is a contaminant that is particularly
        harmful to pregnant women and young children. If you are
        concerned about lead in your water, contact your local
        health authorities to find out how you can have your
        water tested by a certified laboratory. If tests reveal
        that the lead content of your water is about 15 parts per
        billion, you should reduce your exposure to it. Since
        warm water absorbs more lead than cold, when you cook,
        always start with cold water. Because water standing in
        pipes tends to absorb lead, clear the pipes before
        drinking by letting your tap run until the water is cold.
        Catch the running water and use it to water your plants.</p>

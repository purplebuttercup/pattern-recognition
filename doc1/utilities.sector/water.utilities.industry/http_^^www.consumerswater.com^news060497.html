LONDONDERRY, May 7, 1997-- Seven employees of the Consumers New Hampshire Water  Company (CNHWC) are being honored for their extraordinary efforts to serve  customers last December during what has been identified as the most damaging  snow storm in state history.  They will receive a Consumers Water Company  President's PACE Award at the company's annual meeting in Portland, Maine on May  7.

<BR> 
<P>
The President's PACE Awards recognizes individual employees or teams of  employees who have demonstrated a special commitment to serving their customers,  communities or company.  The New Hampshire employees are Kevin Chamberlain of  Raymond, Gary Charbonneau of Hudson, Edward Curran of Litchfield, William  Doherty  of Nashua, David Foote of Derry, Arthur Haskins of Londonderry, and Stephen  Rheaume of Litchfield.  <BR> 
<P>
Falling trees and branches caused power outages at 30 of CNHWC's 31 facilities  last December when 16" of wet, heavy snow fell on southern New Hampshire.  Over  a period of six days, from December 6 to 11, the CNHWC operations team worked  around the clock, putting in more than 240 hours of overtime, to restore and  then maintain water service to customers.  Auxiliary pumping stations and  generators were quickly brought online to provide electricity.  In one location,  a portable fire pump was put into service to pump hydrant to hydrant, bypassing  a power-less booster station until electricity was restored.  When necessary,  CNHWC connected to other water system in order to keep water flowing to  customers.

<P>
"We are very proud to have our employees recognized at our company's annual  meeting," said Sharon E. Schulman, president, CNHWC.  "Their dedication,  especially under adverse conditions, demonstrates the Consumers' commitment to  being  the source you can depend on.'"<BR>

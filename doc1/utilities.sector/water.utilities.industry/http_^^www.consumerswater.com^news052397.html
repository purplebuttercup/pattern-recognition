LONDONDERRY, NH  May 23, 1997-- More than 50 children and their parents participated in the annual Bicycle Rodeo and Family Safety Day sponsored by the Kiwanis Club of Greater Londonderry on Sunday, May 18 at Londonderry High School. Children brought their bicycles to be checked for safety by Kiwanis volunteers, and enjoyed hot dogs, drinks and other safety-related events.

Consumers New Hampshire Water Company (CNHWC) donated $200 for raffle prizes, according to Beth Bartlett, Bicycle Safety Chair and Customer Services Manager at CNHWC. 
"We were happy to donate safety-oriented prizes such as bike helmets and first aid kits," said Bartlett.  "As a parent, I know how important it is to teach safe biking habits.  You want your child to enjoy biking without worrying about him or her getting hurt.  Safety is also the number one value at Consumers Water so we're always happy to collaborate with the Kiwanis on this important community event."

The other activities for the afternoon included a performance by the North East Trick Stars, well-known bicycle performing artists.  A police car, fire truck and ambulance were also available for hands-on inspection by children.

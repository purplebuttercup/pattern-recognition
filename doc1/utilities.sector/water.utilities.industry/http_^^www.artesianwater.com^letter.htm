        face="Arial">I would like to again welcome our new
        shareholders to the Artesian Family. Just to recap, on
        May 24, 1996, Janney Montgomery Scott, acting as
        underwriters, successfully offered 675,000 shares of
        Artesian Resources Corporation Class A Non-voting Common
        Stock to the general public at $15 per share. This stock
        was subsequently listed on NASDAQ under the symbol ARTNA.</font></p>

        face="Arial">Earnings per share of common stock in 1996,
        at $1.06, were the same as in 1995 despite the issuance
        of the 675,000 additional common shares. Net income
        applicable to common shares increase to $1,554,157 in
        1996 from $1,088,239 in 1995. The 1995 result includes a
        one-time charge of $784,000, before taxes, related to the
        sale of the company's rental office building. Although
        Artesian Water Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary,
        recorded a 2.2% increase in the number of customers
        during 1996, the extremely wet weather conditions
        throughout the year reduced water usage and delayed
        construction of new homes, resulting in water sales
        revenue just about equal to that of 1995.</font></p>

        face="Arial">In Delaware, the media have devoted
        significant attention to water supply issues in New
        Castle County since the drought in the summer of 1995. An
        assured long-range water supply has been, and remains our
        highest strategic priority. Everyone in Delaware should
        have safe, reliable water service, and Artesian is
        committed to making this a reality.</font></p>

        face="Arial">Artesian has been an active participant in
        the Environmental Impact Study (EIS) since 1988 to
        identify an acceptable long-term source of water supply
        to meet the needs of northern New Castle County over the
        next 50 years. When the EIS began, it identified a 20
        million gallon per day shortfall in available sources of
        supply to meet the area's projected peak water demand in
        2040. I am proud to report that since 1992, Artesian has
        already added 9 million gallons per day of water supply
        through conscientious planning and extensive investment.
        As a result of test wells we drilled in our service area,
        we believe an additional 10.5 million gallons per day of
        undeveloped groundwater supply is available to meet
        future water demands.</font></p>

        face="Arial">As the EIS unfolds, we now see that the
        remaining water &quot;need&quot; is no longer Artesian's.
        Even during the drought of 1995, our water supply was
        abundant and our water quality was superior. We had a
        sufficient supply to sell water to neighboring
        utilities--and we anticipate doing so again. Moreover, we
        will continue our aggressive efforts to prepare for
        further growth of our customer base and ensure an even
        greater supply of water.</font></p>

        face="Arial">Our Churchmans Marsh property was removed
        from consideration as a reservoir option in the EIS
        process, because the state determined that this site
        would not receive wetlands permits. A tract know as
        Thompson's Station is now listed as the preferred site
        for a reservoir. However, our Artesian Marsh site is
        still listed as an option, and we believe it remains a
        viable reservoir alternative. In the event the preferred
        Thompson's Station site proves impractical, the Artesian
        Marsh site could meet the demand arising from future
        growth beyond levels currently projected.</font></p>

        participated in a number of initiatives to enhance the
        quality of life in Delaware beyond simply ensuring
        long-term sources of water supply. We are actively
        involved with state, county and local governments on
        economic development and land use planning issues. We
        believe these efforts will both benefit the residents of
        Delaware and be <img src="images/Dian__Gov-72.jpg"

        increased our service area by 20 percent through our
        expansion initiatives. In the past 14 months, we have
        negotiated water service agreements to serve an
        additional 3.8 square miles in southern New Castle County
        including, most recently, a tract of approximately 1,900
        acres known as Whitehall.</font></p>

        face="Arial">Our work on economic development issues and
        our expansion activities helped us identify a need for
        integrated water management in the state of Delaware.
        Integrated water management means complete stewardship of
        the water cycle, including provision of drinking water,
        treatment of wastewater and management of storm water. As
        a result, we will have more direct control over the water
        resources on which our success depends.</font></p>

        face="Arial">To develop a program of integrated water
        management, we have formed a strategic alliance with two
        distinguished partners in the field of wastewater
        management, George &amp; Lynch, Inc., a major regional
        process facility and heavy site contractor, and
        Woodward-Clyde International-Americas, an international
        design and engineering firm. This alliance, AquaStructure
        Delaware L.L.C., will offer wastewater and storm water
        management throughout Delaware. This new venture still
        needs various governmental approvals; however,
        AquaStructure has already been approached by a number of
        communities interested in the service it has to offer. We
        are excited about the opportunity this alliance gives us
        to provide services in developing areas of the state.</font></p>

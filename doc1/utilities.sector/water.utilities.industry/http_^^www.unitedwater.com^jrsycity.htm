That's when New Jersey         municipalities began looking toward the private sector as a         realistic solution to their asset management needs. The city         of Jersey City partnered with United Water in 1996, taking         the fullest advantage of the new legislation.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Arial">Under the         contract, United Water assumed responsibility for Jersey         City's entire water infrastructure. This includes managing         5,700 acres of watershed land, an 80 million gallon per day         (mgd) treatment plant, a 5 mgd distribution storage         facility, 2 reservoirs totaling 11.3 billion gallons, 23         miles of aqueduct and a 275-mile distribution system. United         Water also handles all maintenance and repairs, billing,         collections and customer service. The company supplies         Liberty Island as well as the city's 239,000         residents.</FONT></P>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Arial"         COLOR="#996600"><IMG SRC="IMAGES/municipal/finfocus.gif"         WIDTH=126 HEIGHT=24 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight         ALIGN=bottom><BR>                  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Arial">The         five-year contract provided the city $11.6 million in         savings during its first year. The contract is expected to         save a total of $38.5 million over the course of the         partnership. These savings are being achieved by a         combination of innovative operations efficiencies, sales of         additional wholesale water, and strategic capital         investment.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Arial">The city is also         realizing additional revenue through a $2.5 million up-front         concession fee, as well as improved collections and         operating efficiencies. United Water has established         programs to reduce unaccounted-for water, enhance corrosion         control efforts and fully computerize the city's         distribution system. Additionally, United Water provided a         new fleet of trucks, returning the existing fleet to the         city for use in other departments. Meter reading has been         subcontracted to the local power utility.</FONT></P>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Arial"         COLOR="#996600"><IMG SRC="IMAGES/municipal/emphempl.gif"         WIDTH=188 HEIGHT=26 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight         ALIGN=bottom><BR>                  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Arial">United         Water assured the city that no jobs would be lost as a         result of the partnership. Through an innovative         arrangement, employees of United Water Jersey City are         "leased" from the city. They remain employees of the         municipal government and retain eligibility for municipal         pensions and benefits.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Arial">United Water         committed to retain all 140 Jersey City Water Department         employees for the first year of the contract. That number         was reduced through attrition, moving employees to other         city slots, and job offers made by United Water. The         salaries of the departed employees were allocated to a fund         designed to provide early-retirement pension incentives to         eligible employees. This further reduced the number of         people employed without eliminating any occupied positions.         By the end of the first year of the contract, positions had         been smoothly reduced from 140 to 80.</FONT></P>                  <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Arial"         COLOR="#996600"><IMG SRC="IMAGES/municipal/commconn.gif"         WIDTH=189 HEIGHT=28 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight         ALIGN=bottom><BR>                  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Arial">United         Water's commitment to Jersey City isn't just limited to the         water quality and service. Through its community relations         program and locally-based office, United Water has         contributed its sponsorship to everything from local blood         drives to helping city schools bring computer technology         into their classrooms.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica,Arial">Jersey City Mayor         Bret Schundler's assessment of the partnership is         unequivocally positive: "This contract truly represents the         best of both worlds." It preserves municipal ownership of         the assets while leveraging the expertise of private         industry.</FONT></P>                  <P><CENTER>         <HR WIDTH=420>         <FONT SIZE="-1"         FACE="Helvetica, Arial"><A HREF="default.html">home</A></FONT><FONT         SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial"> | </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"         FACE="Helvetica, Arial"><A HREF="whoare.htm">who we         are</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial"> |         </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"         FACE="Helvetica, Arial"><A HREF="whatdo.htm">what we         do</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial"> |         </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"         FACE="Helvetica, Arial"><A HREF="investor.htm">investor         info</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial"> |         </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"         FACE="Helvetica, Arial"><A HREF="municpal.htm">municipal         info</A></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial"> |         </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"         FACE="Helvetica, Arial"><A HREF="news.htm">news</A></FONT><FONT         SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica, Arial"> | </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"         FACE="Helvetica, Arial"><A HREF="search.htm">search</A></FONT>         </CENTER>      </TD><TD WIDTH=30>         <P>      </TD><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=140>         <P ALIGN=RIGHT><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0         WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=155>            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=29>                  <P ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF="whoare.htm"><IMG                  SRC="IMAGES/municipal/button1.GIF" ALT="who we are"                  WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=29 X-SAS-UseImageWidth                  X-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=0 ALIGN=top></A>               </TD></TR>            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=31>                  <P ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF="whatdo.htm"><IMG                  SRC="IMAGES/municipal/button2.GIF" ALT="what we do"                  WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=31 X-SAS-UseImageWidth                  X-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=0 ALIGN=bottom></A>               </TD></TR>            <TR>               <TD WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=32>                  <P ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF="investor.htm"><IMG                  SRC="IMAGES/municipal/button3.GIF"                  ALT="investor info" WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=32                  X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=0                  ALIGN=bottom></A>               </TD></TR>            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=31>                  <P ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF="news.htm"><IMG                  SRC="IMAGES/municipal/button4.GIF" ALT="news"                  WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=31 X-SAS-UseImageWidth                  X-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=0 ALIGN=top></A>               </TD></TR>            <TR>               <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=32>                  <P ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF="search.htm"><IMG                  SRC="IMAGES/municipal/button5.GIF" ALT="search"                  WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=32 X-SAS-UseImageWidth                  X-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=0 ALIGN=top></A>               </TD></TR>         </TABLE>      </TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></P></BODY></HTML>

<CENTER>"Recent System Improvements Demonstrate Commitment"<BR></CENTER>
<BR>


<FONT SIZE=3>
LONDONDERRY, April 30 -- To coincide with National Drinking Water Week, May 4-10, and to reemphasize its commitment to customers and the communities it serves, Consumers New Hampshire Water Company (CNHWC) today introduced a new company tagline -- "The Source You Can Depend On."   With increasing public awareness about water safety issues, CNHWC is highlighting its expertise and strong record of providing safe, clean water.
<BR> 
<P>
Two recently completed construction projects have significantly improved water service to local residents.  In Litchfield, a new connection between the Sawmill Brook Community Water System and CNHWC's Core System is bringing improved water quality to about 200 households.  In addition, they now have fire protection for the first time, which may result in reduced homeowner's insurance costs.<BR> 
<P>
In the Spring Wood Hills area of Londonderry, residents have been enjoying safer, cleaner water since January.   When wells in the area were found to have elevated levels of iron, manganese and radon, CNHWC studied ways to eliminate those concerns.  By installing a booster station on Coteville Road, it was possible to connect the Spring Wood Hills system to an alternative, high quality water source and offer fire protection.  
<BR> 
<P>
"We are excited about the tagline because it summarizes the value Consumers offers," said Sharon E. Schulman, president, CNHWC.  "Our customers can depend on Consumers' water quality experts to make sure their water meets or exceeds all state and federal quality regulations for safety.  This is especially critical for our area because of high concentrations of minerals and metals in the ground, such as iron, manganese and radon.  <BR> 
<P>
"Our customers can also depend on Consumers to upgrade and maintain our distribution system so they have a consistent and abundant supply of water. This is important not only in our day-to-day lives, but for the economic health of the area.  And, they can depend on Consumers to be a good corporate citizen." <BR> 
<P>
Consumers New Hampshire Water Company is an affiliate of Consumers Water Company in Portland, Maine and serves more than 20,000 people in Hudson, Londonderry, Litchfield, Pelham, Windham as well as several other communities.  The parent company is publicly traded and can be located on the WorldWide Web at www.consumerswater.com.<BR>

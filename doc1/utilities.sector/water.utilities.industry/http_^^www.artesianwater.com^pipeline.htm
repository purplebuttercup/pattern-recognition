        <p><font size="3"><img src="images/pixel.gif" hspace="10"
        width="1" height="1"></font>The Summer of 1997 was a busy
        one for Artesian Water company. Allow me to take a moment
        to share some of what occurred over the past several
        months, and look ahead through the end of this year.</p>
        <p>The threat of an extended drought, similar to that of
        1995, was probably one <img src="images/Dian.gif"
        align="left" hspace="0" width="150" height="200">of the
        most significant event this summer. Preparations had
        already begun at the State level for a governmental
        response to the drought. Artesian, however, as a result
        of the steady development of self-supply and careful
        planning, had water to serve its customers and, if
        needed, other water users in New Castle County. <u>Our
        groundwater supply, then and now, is in excellent shape</u>.
        fortunately, there was sufficient rainfall to remove any
        concerns over Delaware's drinking water supply.</p>
        <p>This summer Artesian also took the initiative in
        implementing another cost-controlling measure. A
        recently-signed addendum to Artesian's agreement to
        purchase water from the Chester Water Authority (CWA)
        allows Artesian to reduce its minimum purchase of water
        from CWA from four (4) million gallons a day to as low as
        two (2) million gallons a day. This change provides
        Artesian the opportunity to reduce its annual minimum
        purchase of water from CWA and reduce related expenses.
        It gives Artesian the flexibility to appropriately match
        its supply needs during months of higher or lower
        consumption with the amount it must purchase from CWA.
        The new terms also ensure that CWA delivers water through
        December 31, 2021, with the option of extending that date
        for another 25 years.</p>
        <p>In the months ahead, the Public Service Commission
        will consider Artesian's request to increase customer
        rates--the Company's first <em>full</em> rate case since
        1994. The increase of approximately 26% will mainly go
        toward costs associated with making improvements to
        Artesian's water system. We believe that if we invest in
        our total water system <em>today</em>, we can ensure
        continued reliability to customers into the future. <u>Because
        of our advanced planning, we are able to preserve
        Artesian's long-standing tradition of superior quality
        service to all our customer.</u></p>
        <p>We, at Artesian Water, are committed to excellence.
        Thank you for the opportunity to serve you and your
        family, and we appreciate you as a valued customer.</p>

        Harrington is the first to admit that his department has
        major responsibilities at Artesian Water Company. If a

        height="150">ter mornings when the wind chill makes the
        air temperature feel like 30-below, it is the
        Transmission and Distribution Department (T &amp; D) that
        responds to get the water moving again quickly and
        efficiently.</p>
        <p>Supervisor of Artesian's Transmission and Distribution
        Department for the past three years and department
        employee for the last 24 years, Dave has had his fair
        share of overnight water main breaks, mainly due to
        frigid temperatures. He says &quot;it is a hard, dirty
        job&quot;, but one that gives him a great deal of
        satisfaction because it is up to his 17-employee
        department to &quot;keep the water flowing through
        customers' pipes.&quot;</p>
        <p><img src="images/Crew.gif" width="472" height="173"></p>
        <p>The T &amp; D Department also handles more than just
        water main repairs and all related restoration work.
        Employees maintain fire hydrants, inspect new main
        installations and conduct valve maintenance.</p>
        <p>Dave says now that winter is approaching, his staff
        will be on-call around the clock. He says, in terms of
        response time, the cold weather months are often the most
        difficult time of year. He advises customers to remain
        patient during those water main emergencies when the
        temperature is below freezing and the working conditions
        are not the most ideal. He assures customer that response
        time will be within a couple of hours, and that his
        department works to resolve problems quickly.</p>
        <p>Although being a member of the T &amp; D Department
        may be a pretty tough job, especially during the winter
        months, the team is truly a terrific group and they look
        forward to continuing to serve you well.</p>

        FOR WINTER...NOW!!!</strong></font><p><font size="3"><img
        src="images/pixel.gif" hspace="10" width="1" height="1"></font>
        The thought of starting your car on a morning when the
        temperature barely gets above freezing is probably not
        something you're ready to think about. However, as
        unpleasant as it may seem, winter is not too far off. In
        fact, there is no better time than now to begin thinking
        about preparing your home for winter.</p>
        <p>Here are a few tips to keep in mind as winter fast
        approaches:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Just as you check your windows and doors for
                drafts, <em>it is important to check your faucets
                and toilets for leaks</em>. Tiny drips which can
                go so easily unnoticed may result in thousands of
                gallons of water being wasted each month.</li>
            <li><em>But, sometimes, an intentional drip is
                important</em>. By leaving a faucet dripping on
                the coldest nights, you will keep water flowing
                so pipes are less likely to freeze. This can be
                especially helpful for pipes in outside walls
                with less that adequate insulation or in north
                walls without a blanket of shrubs.</li>
            <li><em>Check frequently for frozen pipe during cold
                snaps</em>. Outside water spigots should be
                turned off and any exposed water pipes should be
                wrapped. You can thaw them safely with a
                hand-held dryer used properly, but <strong><u>never</u></strong>
                resort to blow torches or other drastic measures
                which can create a fire hazard.</li>

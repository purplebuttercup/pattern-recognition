LONDONDERRY, June 3 - Consumers New Hampshire Water Company (CNHWC) has begun flushing water mains in its small systems and will continue to do so through June.   Customers in Derry, Pelham, Derry, Windham, Hooksett, Londonderry and Amherst are advised to watch the mail for announcements of when their service will be affected.

Flushing the mains is part of Consumers routine operations program to maintain consistent water quality and improve water flow to customers.   At least once a year, water hydrants are opened to increase water pressure and flush out all naturally occurring minerals and sediment in the pipes.  The process also helps identify leaks in the system and ensures that hydrants are operating properly.

"This is basically spring cleaning at Consumers Water," commented James Piggott, CWNHC operations manager.  Flushing usually takes a few hours and customers are advised not to use the water during the flushing process.  Piggott mentioned that there is often a temporary discoloration of the water.  "It's best if you don't do the laundry since it's possible that mineral deposits could stain clothing," said Piggott.<BR>

Consumers New Hampshire Water Company is an affiliate of Consumers Water Company in Portland, Maine and serves more than 20,000 people in Londonderry, Hudson, Litchfield, Pelham, Windham as well as several other communities.

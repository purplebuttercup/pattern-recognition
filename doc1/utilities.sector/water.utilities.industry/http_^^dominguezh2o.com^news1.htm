<P>LONG BEACH, Calif. (Nov. 21,1997) - Dominguez Services Corporation (Nasdaq:
DOMZ) today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire
the assets of Lucerne, Calif.-based Lucerne Water Company. The transaction
is subject to customary regulatory approval and is expected to close in
approximately 90 days.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="water1.jpg" LOWSRC="water1b.gif" HEIGHT=139 WIDTH=200 ALIGN=LEFT>
Closely-held Lucerne, with more than 1,200 customer connections, represents
Dominguez' initial expansion into northern California. The acquired water
utility will operate as a stand-alone subsidiary of the Company.</P>

<P>The Lucerne purchase is Dominguez' third in 1997, following earlier
acquisitions in the Company's Kern County, Calif. service area. </P>

<P>`Dominguez president and chief executive officer Brian J. Brady said,
``After 86 years of service in southern California, the diversification
into Lake County marks a milestone in our history. It also provides a foothold
for additional expansion in the region should suitable opportunities present
themselves.</P>

<P>``We have expended considerable effort to establish our reputation for
providing consistently high levels of water quality and service. The Company
has also distinguished itself by demonstrating strong corporate citizenship
within the communities we serve. We will continue that tradition in Lucerne,
and look forward to being an active member of the community.'' </P>

holding company that serves approximately 40,000 customers through three

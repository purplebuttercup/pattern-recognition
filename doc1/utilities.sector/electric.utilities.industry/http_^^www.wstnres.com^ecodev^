<h3>Discover Why There's No Place Like Kansas</h3>

Kansas offers abundant natural resources, affordable land, and hard-
working people.  Our air is clean.  We have cultural, topographical 
and recreational diversity and excellent educational resources.<p>

Kansas is the home of Western Resources.  As the parent to two 
utility companies -- KPL and KGE -- Western Resources supplies 
this region with electricity and natural gas.  We offer competitive 
electric rates and natural gas rates among the lowest in the nation.

<b>No Place Offers A More Productive Work Force</b><br>

Kansas is a right-to-work state and Kansas workers are known for 
their strong work ethic and high productivity.  The state ranks 2nd 
in the nation in human resources education and skill levels.  And we 
have better than an 80% high school graduation rate.

Operating Costs/Cost of Living

Kansas has the 7th lowest average cost of living in the U.S. The 
construction cost index is 15% below the national average. And 
Kansas industrial land prices/rents are lower than almost every city 
in the 126 top markets.

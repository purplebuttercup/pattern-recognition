<font size=+1>
PP&amp;L has been a leader in the effort to give electricity customers a choice because we believe it's good for customers. Now we are offering a pilot program that gives our customers the chance to save money while seeing how customer choice works.<br></font>
<ul>
<font size=-1>
<li>Five percent of our customers will get the opportunity to 'test the waters' of competition. They can select a new electricity supplier or choose to buy electricity from PP&amp;L. Participants can drop out of the pilot at any time. 
<li>PP&amp;L will continue to deliver high-quality electric service, maintain the transmission lines and answer questions.
<li>Customers will get the chance to shop for the company that supplies their electricity -- and to look for savings. PP&amp;L will give a credit of as much as 4 cents for each kilowatt-hour of electricity. (Credits will vary by rate schedule.) 
<li><b>The registration period ended Sept. 29.</b> We will select customers at random from those who applied. 
<li><b>If you are not a PP&amp;L customer, but you are interested in
participating in Pennsylvania's Customer Choice Pilot Program you need
to  contact your local electric utility.</b>

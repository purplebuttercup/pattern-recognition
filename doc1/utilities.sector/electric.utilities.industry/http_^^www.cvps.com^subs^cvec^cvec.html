<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Conn Valley's service territory is in two parts, separated by
about 40 miles of Granite State territory. The two areas have a total of 437
miles of line providing service to an average of 14 customers per mile in the
north and 31 in the more urban south.</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>  The northern part of the company is primarily residential. In fact, it is
home to only three industrial customers -- two sawmills and a small printing
press -- and a few local stores. The attractive rolling hills along the
Connecticut River provide a residential area that is growing,  partly because of
its proximity to Dartmouth College and the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The southern part is dominated by the City of Claremont, but also includes
portions of Charlestown, Unity, Cornish and Plainfield. Claremont has a
substantial industrial region along the River and Charlestown Roads and in
several industrial parks. Downtown Claremont itself is undergoing rehabilitation
and some of the old mill buildings have been renovated to house offices and
other commercial functions.</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The  Claremont area is slowly coming out of the depression of the early '90s.
Several new commercial and industrial businesses have opened in the past few
years. Conn. Valley has formed a partnership with the City of Claremont and 1st
NH Bank to attract new business to the area. Central Vermont's economic
development team is actively recruiting industry interest in the Conn. Valley
service territory. The City has been recognized and praised by the state and
other regions for its efforts to promote itself.</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The New Hampshire PUC is establishing a pilot program to determine the
implications of retail competition in the electric utility industry.  For a
two-year period beginning in mid-1996, a small number of customers will be able
to choose their electric provider. Central Vermont  will participate as a full
or partial provider to retain its customers and to compete for additional
customers currently served by other New Hampshire utilities.  </P>

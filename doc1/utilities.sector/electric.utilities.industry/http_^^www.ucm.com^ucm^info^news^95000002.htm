<STRONG>LifeCycle: Take the Long View</STRONG>
<P>
ComEd takes closer look at entire life cycle of every product
it uses
<P>
Do you know where your garbage will be in 20 years? How about
the computer on your desk? Or the tools and equipment you used
this morning?
<P>
For years we have done little planning for what will happen to
the materials we purchase and use everyday. But ComEd is taking
a closer look at the entire life cycle of every product we use.
The goal is to make decisions based not only on what something
costs initially, but on its total expense, including disposal.
<P>
The concept is known as Life Cycle Management and it involves
better design, procurement, use and disposition of our resources.
<P>
What is Life Cycle Management?
<P>
Life Cycle Management (LCM) will mean a real change in ComEd's
culture by forcing us to take the long view about products we
use everyday. It will bring not only better management of costs,
but healthier environmental practices when we consider the long-term
disposal implications of the products we use.
<P>
&quot;Our goal is to minimize costs and to maximize the value
of our resources, for the benefit of our customers and shareholders,&quot;
said Vice President Lou DelGeorge, who will oversee the company's
Life Cycle Management activities. &quot;I believe all our people
will support this activity, especially if we don't build a bureaucracy
around it.&quot;
<P>
The LCM strategy will be structured around four guiding principles:
Life Cycle Cost Management, Optimization of Assets, Shared Responsibility,
and Environmental Stewardship. Through LCM, ComEd will enhance
its role as a responsible corporate citizen and be a competitive
energy supplier.
<P>
What have other companies done?
<P>
Duke Power has established commodity teams to look at life cycle
costs of the supplies and services they use throughout their company.
Duke discovered that purchasing and servicing its own parts washers
would cost less, even though owning their own parts washers had
higher up-front and labor costs. Duke saved money by gaining better
control over the waste and disposal of the solvents it used.
<P>
Through its company-wide use of LCM techniques, Duke has documented
savings of nearly $78 million since 1991.
<P>
Why is this important?
<P>
Our future competitors may not have the burdens of some of the
long-term waste issues we face, such as nuclear waste and fly
ash disposal or PCBs and asbestos removal. At the same time, if
ComEd uses Life Cycle Management techniques correctly many things
we view as waste today can be assets in the future. For example,
stepping up our efforts to sell recyclable materials like old
or damaged distribution poles.
<P>
If we throw them away, we have under utilized them; but if we
find a way to sell or recycle these poles we have found additional
value for our customers and our shareholders.
<P>
What are our plans for 1995?
<P>
In addition to trying to saving money, the Life Cycle Management
teams will focus some specific areas ComEd hopes to see early
benefits from LCM techniques including:
<UL>
<LI>Reducing the costs associated with low level radioactive waste
in the Nuclear Division.
<LI>Examining maintenance costs for buildings no longer in use,
such as the Fossil Division's Waukegan Units 1-5 boiler house.
<LI>Finding better opportunities for the disposal and sale of old
transformers in the Commercial Division.
</UL>
&quot;Our objective in the first year will be two-fold,&quot;
DelGeorge says. &quot;First, to demonstrate the value of the Life
Cycle Management philosophy through specific projects identified
by our major business units. Second, in the early process, we
will begin to develop techniques we can all use in the future.

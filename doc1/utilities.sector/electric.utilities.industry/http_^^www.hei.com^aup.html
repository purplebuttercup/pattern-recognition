<A NAME="introduction"></A>
<H2><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="button.gif" BORDER=0></A> Introduction</H2> 
Over the past three years HEI has worked closely with the Maui High Performance Computing Center (MHPCC) to support their community efforts. HEI has established a web server to assist in this community outreach effort.  As our contributions grow and our use grows in general, it is important we all understand the appropriate &quot;netiquette&quot and how to protect company assets when using the Internet.<P>

We want to continue support of MHPCC and encourage each and every employee to use the resources available via the Internet in a manner that continues the spirit of community contribution and collaboration.  The guidelines in this document are meant to provide useful tips and techniques to promote your effective use of the Internet.<P>

Your best guide to appropriate work-related uses of the Internet is common sense.  Good judgment can guide you to appropriate uses of the Internet.  The smooth operation of the Internet relies on each of us using common sense to collaborate and contirbute electronically.  These guidelines and policies are provided to assist you.  As an extension of MHPCC, we are obligated to adhere to their Acceptable Use Policies.<P> 

In general this requires efficient, ethical and legal utilization of the network resources.  Transmission of any material in violation of any US or state regulation is prohibited.  This includes, but is not limited to: copyrighted material, threatening or obscene material, or material protected by trade secret.  Use for commercial activities is not acceptable.  Use for product advertisement or political lobbying is also prohibited.  If a user violates any of these provisions, his or her access can be terminated and disciplinary and/or appropriate legal action may be taken.<P>


<A NAME="terms"> </A>
<H2><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="button.gif" BORDER=0></A> Terms and Conditions</H2> 

Please read the following carefully.  Your use of the Internet implies that you understand, accept, and agree to abide by them.<P>


<A NAME="MHPCC_Connection">
<H2><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="button.gif" BORDER=0></A> MHPCC Connection</H2> 

The purpose of the NSFNET, which is the backbone network to the
Internet, is to support research and education in and among academic
institutions in the U.S. by providing access to unique resources
and the opportunity for collaborative work.  The use of HEI's computing
facilities and resources and your Internet account must be in support of education and research and consistent with company educational
objectives since HEI is connected to the Internet backbone via ANS and the Maui High Performance Computing Center (MHPCC).  As such, use must be in
accordance with the ANS Acceptable Use Policy, which follows:<P>
<P>
Advanced Network &amp; Services, Inc. (&quot;ANS&quot;) is a not-for-profit
corporation dedicated to the advancement of education and research
in the interest of improving competitiveness and productivity
in the global economic environment.  Accordingly, ANS' objectives are to help expand access to and interchange of information technology
resources among academic, government and industry users, provide
state-of-the-art high speed data networks and related services,
engage in related research and development work, and improve the
ways that information is created and used for education and research
purposes.<P> 

ANS aims to support the academic and research communities,
enhance education and research at all levels, and contribute to
improving the quality of education and research. Organizations
using ANS services will directly benefit if ANS services and facilities
are used in ways which will build overall system efficiencies,
maximize the accessibility of the system, and minimize or eliminate
unimportant or improper traffic over the systems.<P>

<UL> 
<LI>All use of ANS network services shall be intended to facilitate
the exchange of information in furtherance of education and research,
and otherwise be consistent with the broad objectives of ANS.<P> 

<LI>Users of ANS network services shall promote efficient use of the networks to minimize, and avoid if possible, congestion of the networks and interference with the work of other users of the networks.<P> 

<LI>Users of ANS network services shall not disrupt any of the ANS networks as a whole or any equipment or system forming part of its systems, or any services provided over, or in connection with, any of the ANS networks.<P> 

<LI>ANS networks shall not be used to transmit any communication where the meaning of the message, or its transmission or distribution, would violate any applicable law or regulation or would likely be highly offensive to the recipient or recipients thereof.<P> 

<LI>ANS networks shall not be used for commercial purposes. However, if a use is consistent with the purposes and objectives of ANS, then commercial activities in support of that use will be considered an acceptable use of the network.<P> 

<LI>Advertising of commercial offerings is forbidden. Discussion of a product's relative advantages and disadvantages by users of the product is encouraged.  Vendors may respond to questions about their products as long as the responses are not in the nature of advertising.<P>

<LI>Interpretation, application, and possible modification of
this Acceptable Use Policy shall be within the reasonable discretion
of ANS.  Questions about any issue arising under this Policy should
be directed to ANS by User Organizations when an issue first arises.<P>
</UL>

<A NAME="Etiquette">
<H2><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="button.gif" BORDER=0></A> Etiquette</H2>

You are expected to abide by the generally accepted rules of computing
and network etiquette.  These include (but are not limited to)
the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Be polite.<P>

<LI>Use appropriate language.  Do not swear, use vulgarities or
any other inappropriate language.<P>

<LI>Do not reveal the addresses or phone numbers of others. Providing your own personal address or phone number is a personal choice but be aware that Internet transmissions can be monitored by others. <P>

<LI>Note that electronic mail (e-mail) is not guaranteed to be
private. Internet transmissions can be easily intercepted by others
and can be altered en route.<P>

<LI>Do not use computers or networks in such a way that you would
disrupt their use by others.  This includes being aware that you
can create significant network traffic and consume scarce corporate
computing resources by your use of the Internet.  Do not send large files needlessly.<P>

<LI>All communications and information accessible via the network
should be assumed to be private property.  Respect copyright laws
and fair use guidelines.<P>
</UL>

<A NAME="Security"></A>
<H2><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="button.gif" BORDER=0></A> Security</H2>

Do not give your password to another person and do not use another
individual's access information.  Giving access information to
anyone or attempting to login to a company computer or network
or to the Internet using another person's account will result
in immediate cancellation of your user privileges.<P>
 
 
<A NAME="Responsibility"></A>
<H2><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="button.gif" BORDER=0></A> Responsibility</H2>

When you telecommunicate with individuals, groups, or institutions
you do so as an individual.  You should not present your views,
ideas, questions, or actions as representing any HEI company
unless doing so in a professional capacity.  Remember that you
are always identifiable as having an account at &quot;hei.com&quot;
and you must, therefore, make it clear that your communications
represent you and not the corporation when that is the case.<P> 

<UL> 
<LI>Use only services you have authorization to access.<P> 
<LI>Always represent yourself as yourself -- never someone else.<P> 
<LI>Do not send un-encrypted company confidential or proprietary information over the Internet.  If you are uncertain whether material is confidential or proprietary, consult your supervisor.  If you need to utilize encryption, please contact the HEI CIO for direction and authorization.  Also, please remember to observe HEI policies on insider trading.<P> 
<LI>Any software placed on the Internet must comply with applicable
licensing agreements and copyrights.<P> 
<LI>Material that would be considered inappropriate, offensive
or disrespectful to others should not be accessed or stored.<P>
<LI>Respect copyrights and licenses.
<P> 
</UL>
<P> 

Specifically, the Internet should not be used:<P>

<UL>
<LI>For personal gain or profit.<P>
<LI>To represent yourself as someone else.<P>
<LI>For solicitation of employees.<P>
<LI>To provide information about, or lists of, company employees
to others.<P>
<LI>For commercial solicitations of non-company business enterprise.<P>
<LI>When it interferes with your job or the jobs of other employees.<P>
<LI>When it interferes with the operation of the Internet gateways.<P>
<LI>To violate any law or the rights of any person.
<P>
</UL>

<A NAME="E_Mail">
<H2><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="button.gif" BORDER=0></A> E-Mail</H2>

Electronic mail is the most commonly used facility on the Internet.
When communicating outside of our company, remember:<P> 

<UL> 
<LI>Our MHPCC connection prohibits commercial use; your activities
should be related to research or education.<P> 
<LI>Include your e-mail address in your message; MS-Mail or the
recipient's mail system may mask your address.<P>
<LI>The Internet is not secure; you should assume others can
read - and possibly alter - your message.<P>
<LI>No form of chain letter should be sent on the Internet.<P>
<LI>Do not send mail so that it appears to have come from someone
else.<P>
<LI>When replying, selectively quote the original message; do
not include the entire message, edit out what doesn't apply.<P>
<LI>Minimize attached files; large files should be sent via FTP
whenever possible, to minimize network impact and conversion complexities.<P>
<LI>Forgo downloading attached files from people you don't know; they may contain viruses.<P> 
<LI>Practice safe computing: always virus scan programs received by e-mail. 
E-mailing them to others within the company or saving them on a network 
drive can spread a virus very quickly and destroy business data.
<P>
</UL>

Presently, we do not recommend that you give out credit card bank account
information over the Internet.  The information you give out may be observed
or altered by a third party while in transit.  Even if you are using a secure connection, be sure that you know and trust the party you are giving your financial information to.<P> 

Listservs (automatic mailing list programs which forward a message
to a distribution list) facilitate electronic discussions on a
specific topic.<P> 

<UL>
<LI>Subscribe to listservers selectively; they can send you large
numbers of mail messages.<P>
<LI>Understand how they work before you subscribe; send subscription
requests to the administrative address, not the list itself.  <P>
<LI>Save a copy of your subscription confirmation letter for reference.  <P>
<LI>To minimize traffic, reply to a user's question via E-mail, not via the list.
<P>
<P>
</UL>

<A NAME="FTP_and_Telnet">
<H2><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="button.gif" BORDER=0></A> FTP and Telnet</H2>

Trying to remotely access a system you are not authorized to use
is called &quot;fishing.&quot; Unless you have prior authorization,
do not try to get into open ports.<P> 

When downloading software, you must comply with company policies
relating to software, even if the software is in the &quot;public domain.&quot;  Please be sure to scan any programs for viruses before you run them.<P> 

Before downloading or trying to use Internet-specific software
(e.g., a Gopher client, or a new version of Netscape) on your
PC, check with the Help Desk.  You may be violating the license
agreement or may cause problems with your PC, and it's likely
to not work anyway because of our Internet security firewall.<P> 

When a file is available on multiple servers, select the one closest
to Hawaii to minimize Internet traffic.  As a courtesy to others,
try to do large file transfers during off hours for the server.  
Think in terms of the site you are visiting, not your local time.<P>

<A NAME="Usenet_Conference_Participation">
<H2><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="button.gif" BORDER=0></A> Usenet Conference Participation</H2>

Usenet is a conferencing system not yet (as of January 1996) available on our system.  However, it will eventually become available.  Usenet
exchanges tend to be more open, more candid, and more adversarial
at times.  If you are new to Usenet, subscribe to &quot;news.announce.newusers,&quot;
which provides information on &quot;netiquette&quot; (etiquette
on the Internet).  Usenet is for the most part a pretty friendly
place.  However, if you are on Usenet and find yourself being &quot;attacked,&quot;
known as &quot;flamed,&quot; be thoughtful about how you respond.
Remember, you're responding from an HEI address even though you
may be expressing your own opinion.  In many cases, the best thing
is to limit your replies to the facts, or withdraw from the conversation
altogether.<P>

Here are some other guidelines for participation in Usenet:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Read a particular Usenet group for a while before posting
to it; this is known as &quot;lurking&quot;.<P>
<LI>Limit the newsgroups you are posting information or replies
to--be a group expert.<P> 
<LI>Never blindly post something to a large number of groups;
known as &quot;spamming&quot;.<P> 
<LI>Make sure you provide a legitimate Internet address in your
Usenet &quot;reply to&quot; line.<P> 
<LI>Keep your &quot;signature&quot; on postings short--no more
than 3 lines.<P> 
<LI>Don't say something on Usenet you wouldn't say to someone
standing next to you.<P> 
<LI>Consider using a disclaimer, such as: &quot;these opinions
are mine and not necessarily those of Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc. nor any of it's affiliated business units &quot;.<P>

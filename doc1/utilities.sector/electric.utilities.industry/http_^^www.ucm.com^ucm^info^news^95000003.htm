<STRONG>Building a Partnership With Minority Vendors</STRONG>
<P>
Even as more and more companies reduce their number of suppliers,
<A HREF="../comed.htm">ComEd</A> is increasing its efforts to work
with more minority and women business owners.
<P>
ComEd intends to increase its minority purchasing program by 20
percent in 1995, both in terms of dollars spent and number of
suppliers. But reaching that goal means reaching out to suppliers.
ComEd is doing more to align its primary suppliers with minority
vendors and to conduct outreach seminars to demonstrate the best
way to do business with ComEd.
<P>
J.R. Foster Electric is an African-American company in Chicago
that has grown from a decade-long partnership with ComEd. Foster
Electric has overseen electrical maintenance work at Braidwood,
State Line and Fisk generating stations and a number of ComEd
office facilities throughout northern Illinois.
<P>
The two companies have worked closely to meet one another's needs.
ComEd has even trained Foster Electric's skilled electricians
in the area of high voltage work common for the utility.
<P>
&quot;Working with ComEd is an opportunity to increase and expand
my business,&quot; said John Foster, president of Foster Electric.
&quot; The partnership is good for both of us. And the on-site
training for my office staff in purchasing has increased our business
awareness and knowledge.&quot;
<P>
In 16 years, J. R. Foster has seen his business flourish, taking
on electrical work in some of Chicago's largest buildings. &quot;Edison
would fight to get us on the job,&quot; Fosters said. &quot;You
don't get those constant call backs from other companies.&quot;

NU, through our operating subsidiaries The Connecticut Light and Power Company,
Public Service of New Hampshire, and Western Massachusetts Electric Company, provides
electric energy services to approximately 1.7 million people.  We view our
responsibility as extending far beyond the provision of electric service.  To us, it
extends into enhancing the very quality of life in the homes and communities of the
customers we serve and the quality of our environment.

<P>

To implement our vision, we work in partnership with community  groups and public
officials to build healthier communities and address vital community problems.  More
information about our programs is listed under:

<h4>NATURE TRAILS</h4>

Nature Trails and Shepaug Eagle Viewing Area Along the Housatonic River

<br>

Discover the natural and cultural history along the Housatonic River at our nature
trails.

<p>

Housatonic River Nature Trails/Shepaug Eagle Viewing Facility<br>

Falls Village Nature Trail<br>

Falls Village, CT<br>

&#149;The People Shaping the Landscape Trail is located in Falls Village,
Connecticut, and meanders through forests and fields and traces the story of a land
rich in history from the Native Americans' use of the Housatonic River for food and
transportation to the glorious vision and instant failure of an industrial canal
system.  Across the river is a second nature trail, the Falls Village Historical
Trail, which describes the old industrial uses of the land including a Civil War
cannon factory and a railroad repair shop.

<P>



Falls Village Station Nature Trail<br>

Route 7, Falls Village, CT<br>

&#149;The 3/4-mile loop in the beautiful northwest corner of Connecticut meanders
through the forest and fields.  Along the way, post markers and a trail guide point
out how the landscape changed from virgin oak, pine, and hemlock to logged-over land
where a booming iron industry arose in the 18th century, requiring huge amounts of
wood to make charcoal for smelters and forges.  The stone ruins of a never-used dike
and canal system from that era can also be seen, as well as signs of reforestation
once previous land uses were abandoned.

<BR>

Directions:  From Route 7 South turn right at the blinking light at the junction of
Route 126 North.

<br>

From Route 7 North turn left at the blinking light at the junction of Route 126
North.  Proceed straight on Route 126 for 1/2 mile and turn left at the stop sign.

the eagles may feed.  Reservations for an opportunity to visit the Eagle Observation
Area must be made by calling (800) 368-8954.  There are restrictions placed on the
number of visitors allowed at one time.  This area is only open on specific dates

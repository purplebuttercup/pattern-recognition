<STRONG>The Power Bus:  On the Road to Reduce Energy Bills </STRONG>
<P>
Looking for a way to cut your energy costs? How about climbing
aboard The Power Bus, ComEd's newest energy conservation exhibit.
<P>
Strolling through The Power Bus is like taking a trip through
your own home. The 40-foot vehicle is loaded with hands-on exhibits
that give visitors useful energy tips on lighting, insulation,
windows and air conditioning. Through an interactive computer,
you can determine the most energy efficient refrigerator, freezer
or room air conditioner to buy for your home.
<P>
You will actually be able to feel the difference between a leaky,
uninsulated window and a weather-sealed one. A press of a button
will show you what a difference a water-saver shower head can
make. And stepping to the back of the bus will be just like walking
outside your home. You'll see just how much difference outdoor
lighting makes in protecting your home against vandalism and burglary.
<P>
Finally, visitors can test their knowledge by playing &quot;For
Love or Money,&quot; The Power Bus' interactive game show.
<P>
The Power Bus was custom-built for ComEd's service territory and
is designed to entertain and educate adults about ways to eliminate
energy waste and control costs. The bus will be visiting home
shows, festivals, and community events throughout northern Illinois.
For more information, call (708) 746-7492.

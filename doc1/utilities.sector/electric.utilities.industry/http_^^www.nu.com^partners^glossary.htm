 <b>Amps:</b>
</P> 
AMPS are the amount of electricity or current flowing through a wire, similar to    
 the flow of water through a pipe.  A typical residential heating service capacity is 
100 amps.  200 amps or more are required with electric heating.<BR>
<p>
<b> Arcing (Overheating):</b> 
<p>
 ARCING is the flow of electricity through the air from one conductor to another.  Arcing can produce visible flashes and flames and emit crackling sounds.  It is caused
 by overloaded electrical equipment.<br>

<p>
<b> Ballast:</b>
<p> 
 A BALLAST is a device that is used to start a lamp and maintain proper 
 current and voltage to keep it operating.  Florescent and High-Intensity   
 Discharge (HID) lamps require ballasts.<br>
<p>
<b> Brownout:</b>
<p> 
 A reduction in voltage and/or power when demand for electricity exceeds
 generating capacity.  The term BROWNOUT is misleading because customers generally 
 do not notice the reduction, except when it affects sensitive  electronic equipment.<br>
<p>
<b> BTU (British Thermal Unit):</b> 
<p>
 A BTU is the standard unit for measuring the quantity of heat energy such as the 
 heat content of fuel.  It is the amount of heat energy necessary to raise the temperature
 of one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit (3412 BTUs=1 kWh).<br>

<p>
<b> Cable:</b>
<p>
 A CABLE is a wire or bundle of wires which is a fully insulated conductor.    
It can be installed underground or overhead.<br>
<p>
<b> Capacitor:</b>
<p>
A CAPACITOR is a device that helps improve the efficiency of the flow of
 electricity through distribution lines by reducing energy losses.  It is installed in 
 substations and on poles.  Usually it is installed to correct an unwanted     
 condition in an electrical system.<br>
<p>
<b> Capacity:</b>
<p>
 CAPACITY is the maximum load of electricity that equipment can carry.<br>
<p>
<b> Check Meter:</b>
<p>
 A CHECK METER is usually installed as a temporary unit to measure the 
 amount of current used by a particular appliance or piece of equipment.<br>
<p>
<b> Circuit (CKT):</b>
<p> 
 A CIRCUIT is a path through which electricity travels.<br>
<p>

<b> Circuit Breaker:</b>

<p>

 A CIRCUIT BREAKER is a switch which "trips out" or disconnects an electric     

 circuit upon overload or abnormal conditions.  Circuit breakers are located  

 in substations and on transmission and distribution lines throughout our     

 network.  They operate in the same manner as those found in your home.<br>

<p>

<b> Condensation:</b>

<p>

 CONDENSATION is the collection of droplets of water produced when water vapor 

 comes into contact with a cold surface.<br>

<p>

<b> Conductor:</b>

<p>

 An object or substance which CONDUCTS or leads electric current.  A wire, cable,

 busbar, rod, or tube can serve as a path for electricity to flow.  The most common 

 conductor is an electrical wire.<br>

<p>

<b> Conduit:</b>

<p>

 A CONDUIT is a tube, duct, or pipe used for protecting wires.<br>

<p>

<b> Convection:</b>

<p>

 CONVECTION is the transfer of heat by the motions of fluids or gases<br>





<p>

<b> CONVEX:</b>

<p>

 CONVEX is the Connecticut Valley Electric Exchange, located in Newington

 CT.  CONVEX plans and coordinates the dispatch of bulk electric power in       

 Connecticut and Western Massachusetts.  It is one of five satellite stations  

 of the New England Power Exchange (NEPEX) which dispatches virtually all      

 power across New England.<br>

<p>

<b> Current Transformer  (CT):</b>

<p>

 CURRENT TRANSFORMERS are used in conjunction with metering equipment.

 They are designed to permit measurement of currents beyond the range of a meter.<br>

<p>

<b> Customer Rights:</b>

<p>

 NU will work with the customer  to reach a reasonable arrangement for customer

 complaints and special requirements such as payment arrangements.   If we can't  

 come to an agreement on resolution or an arrangement,  NU will refer this to a 

 company review officer.<br>

<p>

 NU will not shut off your service for nonpayment while this review is under way.  

 You must, however, pay your current bills during this procedure.<br>

<p>

<b> Customer Service Charge:</b>

<p>

 The CUSTOMER SERVICE CHARGE is a portion of the customer's bill    

 which remains the same from month to month.  The charge is determined      

 separately from the amount of energy used.  It is based on the costs associated

 with connecting a customer to the company's distribution system, including the

 service connection and metering equipment.<br>

<p>

 The Customer Service Charge also recovers expenses such as meter reading

 billing costs, customer accounting expenses  records and collections, and a

 portion of general plant items such as office space for customer service personnel.<br>

<p>

<b> Cutout:</b>

<p>

 A CUTOUT is a piece of easily melted metal, which when inserted in an electric

 circuit, melts when the current becomes too great and blows when overloaded   

 by too much demand.<br>

<p>

<b> Degree Day:</b>

<p>      

 A DEGREE DAY is a measure of temperature variation from standard, used       

 primarily in connection with heating and cooling loads.  This is determined  

 by subtracting the average outdoor temperature of the day from 65&#176 F  

 (65&#176 F is the point below which artificial heat is normally required to 

 maintain comfort in the home or building.)  For any one day when the mean    

 temperature is less than 65&#176 F, many degree days exist as   

 there are Fahrenheit degrees difference in temperature.<br>

<p>

<b> Demand (kW):</b>

<p> 

 DEMAND (kW) is the total amount of electricity required at any given time by  

 a utility's customers.  It is expressed in kW.  (See Electric Demand.)<br>

<p>

<b> Demand Billing:</b>

<p>  

 DEMAND BILLING is the demand upon which billing to a customer is based, as    

 specified in the rate schedule or contract.  The billing demand need not      

 coincide with the actual measured demand for a billing period.<br>                   

<p>

<b> Demand Charge:</b>

<p>  

 DEMAND CHARGE is the specified charge to be billed on the basis of the 

 billing demand, under the applicable rate schedule or contract.<br>

<p>

<b> Demand Ratchet:</b>

<p>  

 DEMAND RATCHET is the minimum billing demand based upon a given percentage   

 of the actual demand use, recorded during the last eleven months of demand   

 history.<br>

<p>

<b> Distribution Line:</b>

<p> 

 A DISTRIBUTION LINE is a line or system for distributing power from a       

 transmission system to a customer.  It is any line operating at less than   

 69,000 volts.<br>

<A NAME="e"><FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR="#000066">- E -</FONT></A>

<p>

<b> Electric Demand:</b>

<p>   

 ELECTRIC DEMAND refers to the maximum load at which a customer uses           

 electricity for a given period of time.  Demand is measured in 15 minute and  

 30 minute intervals.  A customer's demand is recorded on the demand register  

 scale on the meter.<br>                                                           

<p>

<b> Electric System:</b>

<p>   

 ELECTRIC SYSTEM refers to all of the elements needed to distribute electrical power.   

 This includes overhead and underground lines, poles, transformers, and other     

 equipment.<br>	

<p>

<b> Electricity:</b>

<p>        

 ELECTRICITY is a form of energy produced by power plants.<br>

<p>

<b> Energy:</b>

<p>

 ENERGY is the ability to do work.  Some different kinds of energy include:

 electrical energy, solar energy, wind energy, and nuclear energy.<br>

<p>

<b> Energy Efficiency Ratio:</b>

<p>

 An ENERGY EFFICIENCY RATIO is the energy output of an appliance related to   

 its energy consumption.  The higher the number, the more efficient the       

 appliance.<br>

<p>                       

<b> Entrance Cable/Service Entrance Conductors:</b>

<p> 

 The ENTRANCE CABLE/SERVICE ENTRANCE CONDUCTOR is the cable running down the   

 side of a customer's house into the meter.  This cable is owned by the        

 customer and its maintenance is the customer's responsibility.  Work on this  

 cable should only be performed by a licensed electrician.<br>                     

<p>   

<b> Equivalent Customer:</b>

<p>    

 The concept of EQUIVALENT CUSTOMER is utilized with multiple

 occupancy residences.  It is often determined by the number of kitchens the

 residence contains. The number of equivalent customers impacts customer 

 charges when the billing rate contains multiple energy block charges.<br>

<A NAME="f"><FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR="#000066">- F -</FONT></A>

<p>

<b> Fault:</b>

<p>   

 A FAULT is a failure or interruption in an electrical circuit.<br>  

<p>                                    

<b> Feeder:</b>

<p>  

 A FEEDER is an electrical supply line, either overhead or underground, which  

 runs from the substation, through various paths, ending with the transformers.     

 It is a distribution circuit, usually less than 69,000 volts, which carries power

 from the substation.<br>

<p>                                      

<b> Feeder Lockout:</b>

<p>

 FEEDER LOCKOUT happens when a main circuit is interrupted at the substation 

 by automatic protective devices and cannot be restored until crews investigate.

 This indicates a serious problem on the circuit, usually equipment failure

 or a broken conductor.<br>

<p>                                

<b> Fixture:</b>

<p>       

 A FIXTURE is a complete lighting unit including one or more lamps with a

 connection to a power source.  Fixtures may also include one or more       

 ballast.<br>

<p>                                

<b> Fluorescent Lamp:</b>

<p>  

 A FLUORESCENT LAMP is a lamp in which a current passes through mercury vapor, 

 generating ultraviolet energy.  There is a phosphorous coating inside the bulb that

 transforms that ultraviolet energy to visible light.  A fluorescent lamp is more energy

 efficient than standard incandescent lighting.<br>

<p>                            

<b> Fossil Fuel:</b>

<p>            

 FOSSIL FUEL is fuel found in the ground, made up of decayed plant and animal  

 life.  Fossil fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas.<br>

<p>                       

<b> Franchise Area:</b>

<p>

 FRANCHISE AREA is the territory in which a utility system supplies service    

 to customers.<br>

<p>

<b> Fuel or Fossil Fuel:</b>

<p>   

 FUEL OR FOSSIL FUELS are for electric generation.  These would include all

 types of fuel - solid, liquid, gaseous, and nuclear - used exclusively for the

 production of electricity.<br>

<p>      

<b> Fuel Adjustment:</b>

<p>        

 A clause in the rate schedule that provides for adjustment of the amount of a 

 bill as the cost of fuel varies from a specified base amount per unit.  The     

 specified base amount is determined when rates are approved.<br>                  

<p>                                                                               

 This item is shown on all customer bills and indicates the current rate for   

 any necessary adjustment in the cost of fuel used by the company.  It can be a

 credit or a debit.  The fuel adjustment lags two (2) months behind the actual 

 price of the fuel.  For example, the cost of oil in January will be reflected in 

 March's fuel adjustment.<br>

<p>     

<b> Fuse:</b>

<p> 

 A FUSE is a piece of metal, which when inserted into an electric circuit, melts

 when the current becomes too great.  High demand

 or an overloaded circuit will cause the fuse to blow.  A fuse is used along

 distribution lines in order to isolate interruptions to a specific area.<br>

<p>                       

<b> Fuse/Fused Cutout:</b>

<p>

 A FUSE/FUSED CUTOUT protects the distribution line from overloading.  It acts 

 by melting during circuit overload or faulty conditions, breaking the circuit.   

 A fuse/fused cutout is similar to fuses found in fuse boxes in homes.<br>

<b> Generate:</b>

<p>                    

 To GENERATE is to make electricity.<br>

<p>

<b> Generating Station:</b>

<p>          

 A GENERATING STATION is a building where electricity is made.  This term is   

 used interchangeable with "power plant".<br>                                      

<p>                                                                                

 A Generating Station is a station at which are located prime movers, electric 

 generators, and auxiliary equipment for converting mechanical (water, wind,)  

 chemical (fossil fuels) and/or nuclear energy into electric energy.<br>           

<p>

<b> Generation:</b>

<p> 

 GENERATION is the act or process of transforming other forms    

 of energy into electric energy.<br>

<p>  

<b> Generator - Electric:</b>

<p>

 GENERATOR is a machine which transforms mechanical energy into     

 electrical energy.<br>                                                            

<p>

<b> Gigawatt:</b>

<p> 

 A GIGAWATT is one billion watts; useful for describing the capacity of large

 electrical systems.<br>

<p>

<b> Ground:</b>

<p>

 A GROUND happens when one or more conductors touch the earth causing the    

 electricity to flow out of the circuit and into the earth.<br>                  

<p>

<b> Guy Wire:</b>

<p>                               

 A GUY WIRE is a device used to support a pole.<br> 

<p>

<b> GET (Gross Earnings Tax Adjustment):</b>

<p>    

 The GET is charged by the state of Connecticut to every commercial and

 industrial customer.  The amount is built into each  rate  structure.   It is

 separate from Connecticut sales tax exemption for the sale or service of

 electricity to manufacturers.<br>

<p>

 This GROSS EARNINGS TAX reduction will only apply to companies engaged    

 in a manufacturing production process whose standard industrial

 classification (SIC) is between 2000 and 3999, in accordance with the SIC

 Manual United States Office Of Management And Budget, 1987 EDITION.<br>  

<p>

<b> GU Adjustment:</b>

<p>                          

 By displacing expensive oil, nuclear plants provide large savings to          

 customers.  Our base electric rates reflect savings from the operation of         

 Northeast Utilities' nuclear plants at an average level of 72 percent of      

 full capacity.  The GU ADJUSTMENT adjusts those savings to reflect actual     

 performance above or below 72 percent.  When actual performance is above      

 72 percent and savings are greater than assumed, the GU Adjustment rate is    

 a credit to customers.  When nuclear performance is lower than 72 percent     

 and savings are less than reflected in base rates, the GU Adjustment rate is

 a charge.  However, our customers will continue to save even if our nuclear   

 plants operate as low as 25 percent of capacity.<br>                              

<p>                                                                               

 The amount of the GU Adjustment charge on a customer's bill is determined by  

 multiplying the GU Adjustment rate shown on the bill times the kilowatt      

 hours (kWh) used in the current billing period.<br>

<b> Heat Pump:</b>

<p>   

 HEAT PUMP is a device that removes heat from one source and dissipates it   

 elsewhere.  In a building, it would heat the air in winter and cool the air   

 in the summer.  Several different types of heat pumps exist, but the most     

 common are air to air heat exchangers.<br>

<p>

<b> High-Intensity Discharge (HID) Lamps:</b>

<p>   

 HIGH-INTENSITY DISCHARGE (HID) LAMP is the general term for mercury, metal  

 halide, and high pressure sodium lamps.<br>

<p>

<b> Horsepower:</b>

<p>                             

 HORSEPOWER is a unit for measuring the power of motors or engines.  One (1)   

 horsepower equals 746 watts.  However, for all practical purposes, one        

 horsepower is considered 1000 watts or 1 kilowatt (figure considers starting  

 load and motor inefficiency).<br>                                                 

<p>                                                                                

 For example, a 3 horsepower motor would be rated at approximately 3,000 watts   

 or 3 kW, so a 1/3 horsepower furnace motor would be rated at approximately    

 333 watts.<br>

<p>

<b> Hydroelectric:</b>

<p>                          

 HYDROELECTRIC identifies a type of generating station where mechanical energy 

 produced by falling water is transformed into electrical energy.<br>

<b> Incandescent Lamp:</b>

<p>   

 An INCANDESCENT LAMP is one that creates light when an electric current flows 

 through a tungsten filament, heating the filament to the point where it glows 

 (incandescence).<br>                                                              

<p>

<b> Insulation (Thermal):</b>

<p>                   

 INSULATION (THERMAL) is a non-conducting material having a relatively high    

 resistance to heat flow and used primarily to retard heat flow.  It also can  

 be the protective material covering the electric wire.  Rubber or             

 polyethylene are commonly used.<br>                                               

<p>

<b> Insulator:</b>

<p>

 An INSULATOR is a device through which electricity cannot easily pass.

 An example would be porcelain support used to insulate conductors from a

 pole or tower.  An insulator can be constructed of material such as porcelain,

 glass, rubber, and wood.<br>      

<p>

<b> Interconnections System:</b>

<p>     

 An INTERCONNECTIONS SYSTEM is a connection between two electrical systems    

 permitting the transfer of electric energy in either direction.<br>              

<p>

<b> Interruptible Power:</b>

<p>         

 INTERRUPTIBLE POWER is power whose delivery can be curtailed by the supplier,

 usually under some sort of agreement by the parties involved.<br>

<p>

<b> Interruptible rate:</b>

<p> 

 INTERRUPTIBLE RATES provide power at a lower rate to large industrial and

 commercial customers who agree to reduce their electricity use in times of

 peak demand.<br>

<p>

<b>Investor-Owned Utility:</b>

<p>      

 An INVESTOR-OWNED UTILITY, such as Northeast Utilities, is a tax-paying utility

 company owned by private investors (stockholders).<br>

 1 kilowatt (kW) = 1,000 watts.<br>

<p>

<b> kilowatt-hour (kWh):</b>

<p>         

 KILOWATT-HOUR (kWh) is the basic unit of electric energy equal to 1 kilowatt  

 or 1,000 watts of power used for one hour.  The amount of power the customer  

 uses is measured in kilowatt hours (kWh).<br>                                    

<p>                                                                               

 For example, a 100 watt light bulb that burns for 10 hours = 1 kWh (100 watts x 10 hrs.)

 or 1,000 watts used in 10 hours.<br>

 A SHORT CIRCUIT is an accidentally established connection between two points  

 in an electric circuit such as when a tree limb or an animal bridge the gap 

 between two conductors.  This will cause an overload of current on the line causing

 melting of lines, blown fuses, and the faulty operation of protective devices such as

 reclosures and circuit breakers.<br>

<p>

<b> Single Phase Line:</b>

<p>

 as compared to heavy duty three phase constructs.<br>

<p>

<b> Solar Heating:</b>

<p>                       

 SOLAR HEATING is heat created by the energy of the sun.  Solar heat can be

 either active or passive.  Passive solar heating, as the name suggests, takes

 advantage of the heat created through natural means (heat created when sunlight

 passes through a window and becomes trapped inside a building).  Active solar

 heating systems are made up of three components:  the solar collector, energy storage,

 and distribution pipes or ducts.  Sunlight is collected by absorber panels,       

 conditioned if required, and distributed through the building by a heat transfer

 fluid or by air.<br>

<p>

<b> Solar Hot Water:</b>

<p>                     

 SOLAR HOT WATER is a similar setup to an active solar heating system except

 it is used to preheat water used principally for normal domestic hot water use.          

 Collectors trap sunlight creating heat.  Transfer fluid moves heat from       

 collectors to water holding tanks.  This system requires a supplemental heating

 source for days when there is inadequate sunlight to heat water to required

 temperatures.<br>

<p>

<b> Substation:</b>

<p>                          

 A SUBSTATION is a small building or fenced in yard containing switches,       

 transformers, and other equipment and structures for the purpose of adjusting 

 voltage, monitoring circuits and other service functions.  As electricity     

 gets closer to where it is to be used, it goes through a substation where the 

 voltage is lowered so it can be used by homes, schools, and factories.<br>        

<p>

<b> Super-Insulation:</b>

<p>                    

 SUPER-INSULATION is a means of constructing buildings to ensure minimal

 heat load.  R-40 walls and R-60 ceilings, air-tight construction, and shuttered windows

 that face south are all examples of this.<br>

<p>

<b> Switching Station:</b>

 A VOLT is a unit of electrical pressure.  It measures the force or push of

 electricity.  Volts represent pressure, correspondent to the pressure of water in    

 a pipe.<br>                                                                       

<p>

 A volt is the unit of electromotive force or electric pressure analogous to    

 water pressure in pounds per square inch.  It is the electromotive force      

 which, if steadily applied to a circuit having a resistance of one ohm, will  

 produce a current of one ampere.<br>

<b> Watt (Energy):</b>

<p> 

 A WATT is a measure of how much electricity an appliance needs.<br>

<p>

 A watt is an electrical unit of power.  This term is commonly used to rate    

 appliances using relatively small amounts of electricity.  Wattage is stamped 

 on light bulbs and all appliances.<br>

<p>

 There is a mathematical relationship between watts, volts, and amps which  

 is expressed as:  Wattage = Amps x Voltage<br>                                    

<p>                                                                               

 For example, a 120 volt, 15 amp circuit will carry 1800 watts.<br>

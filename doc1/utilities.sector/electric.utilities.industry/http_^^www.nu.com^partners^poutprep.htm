<H2>Basement Flooding</H2></a>

If you anticipate basement flooding during a storm, turn off your water       

heater, furnace and non-submersible sump pump, and your electric system       

before water can reach them.  ELECTRICITY AND WATER CREATE A DANGEROUS MIX, so

don't go into your basement or attempt to turn off the electricity in your    

basement if it's already flooded.                                         

<P>

Some volunteer fire departments may pump out flooded basements.              

<P>

Be sure to have all electrical equipment including washing machines, dryers   

and spare refrigerators checked by an electrician before restarting.

<H2>Garage Doors (Electric)</H2>

</a>

<P>

Doors of this type may be opened by disengaging

the drive mechanism.  Methods used to do this vary from manufacturer to manufacturer.

Please consult your operating instructions supplied by the manufacturer.

They will tell you how to disengage the drive mechanism so that you can

open the door manually.  If you do not have a manufacturer's instruction book, 

call the company that installed the doors.

<H2>Generator Installation</H2>

</a>

<P>

Have a qualified, licensed electrician install your

generator.  The generator 

must be connected to your home's wiring through a

special transfer switch to  

ensure that the house wires are isolated from the

utility wires so that our 

lines cannot be energized by your generator.                        

<P>

If a portable generator is improperly connected to

your house's electrical    

system, the electricity it generates not only enters

the home's wiring but    

could be back feeding into the NU electrical system,

creating a life-threatening   

hazard for repair crews or others nearby.

<a name="pipes">

<H2>Keeping Your Pipes from Freezing</H2>

</a>

<P>

Shut off the valve that allows water to come into

your home.  Then, open any  

drain valves and all faucets and let them run until

the pipes are empty (it's 

helpful to identify these valves in advance).  Next,

flush all toilets and    

pour denatured alcohol into toilets and sinks to

prevent water in the traps   

from freezing.  Do NOT use automotive antifreeze

in case there's trouble with 

your water system; you don't want the antifreeze

to contaminate your drinking water.  You may, however, use nontoxic

antifreeze that's made for winterizing motor homes.                                               

<P>

Turn off the furnace emergency switch.  Then drain

your furnace boiler by

opening the valve at the bottom (this looks like

a garden faucet).  Also, open

all radiator vents.  Be sure the boiler is filled

with water again before it  

is restarted.                                                           

<P>

The tank of your electric water heater will keep

water warm for the first few 

days after an outage.  However, it can freeze after

prolonged cold and should 

be drained after three days of below freezing temperatures.

<H2>Medical Problems</H2>

</a><P>

If you have a special medical problem, call your

local INFOLINE, the American 

Red Cross, or your local town or civil defense officials

for information about

shelters.  If you're ill or frail, consider staying

with relatives at a town 

shelter if the outage will be lengthy.                                  

<P>

If a member of your household relies on electric

equipment for a life-threatening medical condition, we suggest a back-up

plan to provide the patient

with alternative facility   

care in case of a        

prolonged outage.   

<P>

If you have medication that requires refrigeration,

check with your pharmacist for guidance on proper storage during an extended

outage.  You may want to keep a small cooler handy.

<P>Smaller pets such as fish, birds and reptiles

may be endangered. Since many of these animals are fragile, we recommend that you

do not wait until an outage strikes to devise alternate arrangements.                             

<P>

Check with a reputable pet store to determine what

steps you can take before and during an outage to ensure your pet's survival.

<H2>Portable Generators</H2>

</a>

<P>

If you feel that you cannot tolerate an extended power outage, we recommend   that you purchase a portable generator.  Select a

generator correctly sized   to meet your needs.  Ask your dealer for guidelines. There are important,    

life saving issues involved in selecting, purchasing, installing and maintaining a portable generator.  Also, you may

need a town permit or an official inspection.                                                    

<P>

Please be aware that improper portable generator installation and use 

<STRONG>COULD KILL AN UNSUSPECTING LINE WORKER.</STRONG>  It could also cause a house fire.  Do not  

use a generator until you can use it safely.                                 

<P>

<STRONG>GENERATOR EXHAUST IS DEADLY.</STRONG>  We recommend that the

unit not be located  indoors.  Never refuel the generator while it's

operating.

<H2>Protecting Sensitive Electronic Equipment</H2>

</a>

<P>You may want to use surge suppressers to protect your sensitive electrical    

equipment from voltage irregularities, disturbances that can      

jumble your computer data.  VOLTAGE IRREGULARITIES can occur when the power   

line between your house and the pole is damaged, or there's damage to your    

SERVICE ENTRANCE CABLE (the wire running down the side of your house to the   

electric meter).                                                

<P>

Whole house SURGE SUPPRESSOR KITS can help protect your home from power surges.

Small surge suppressers can be installed in outlets into which electronic     

equipment is plugged.  Power surge suppressers are available in most

department stores.  Before you buy one, be sure it bears the Underwriters' Laboratories (UL) 1449 label for safety.

<P>

<B>Before a storm</B> -- Set your refrigerator and freezer to their coldest settings  

(remember to reset them after).  Throw a blanket over both for extra insulation to keep the cold in.  It's a good

idea to place plastic containers filled with water in your freezer - ice helps maintain the cold during        

outages.                                                                   

<P>

<B>During a storm</B> -- <B>DON'T OPEN THE REFRIGERATOR OR FREEZER DOOR</B>. If the unit's door

is unopened, food stays in a full refrigerator for up to 24 hours

and in a freezer up to 48 hours if it's well packed; 24 hours

if it's half packed.   You might load up a cooler with ice and

store food you'll need during the first day or so after an outage.

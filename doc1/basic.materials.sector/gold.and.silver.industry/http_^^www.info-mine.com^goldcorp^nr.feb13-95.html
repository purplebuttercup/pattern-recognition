Toronto, Canada<br>
February 13, 1995<p>
    
    
Goldcorp Inc. today announced a reduction in the production rate at its Red
Lake Mine in northwestern Ontario, in order to facilitate a significant 
increase in exploration and development at the mine.  As a consequence, 
the workforce has been reduced from 283 to 234 employees.<p>
    
The production rate at the Red Lake Mine is being reduced from 1,000 tons 
to 650 tons per day, which will result in budgeted annual gold output of 
50,000 ounces per year, compared to 66,000 ounces produced in 1994.  A 
two-year exploration and development program has commenced and will include 
200,000 feet of exploration drilling and 130,000 feet of development 
drilling, for a total cost of $10 million.<p>
    
Development drilling will be carried out between the surface and 30 
Level, and exploration drilling will be between 30 and 38 Levels.  Initial 
exploration results show strong continuity of gold bearing structures 
between 30 and 34 Levels.<p>
    
Upon completion of this program, workforce requirements at the Red Lake 
Mine will be reassessed.<p>

<center><h4>DAYTON MINING CORPORATION ANNOUNCES ANDACOLLO GOLD RESOURCE INCREASES BY 15%, HIGH GRADE 
ZONE DISCOVERED AT ANDACOLLO AND THREE NEW PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED</h4></center>

<b>VANCOUVER</B> - As a result of an aggressive exploration
program during the first half of 1996, Dayton Mining Corporation is pleased
to report that gold resources at the Andacollo Gold Mine have increased
by 350,000 ounces to approximately 2,600,000 ounces of gold. During the
same period, Dayton has recently acquired three new properties in Chile
which will be included in the continuing 1996 drill program. </P>

<P>A highlight of the current drill program is the discovery of a high
grade contact breccia zone which intersected 468 feet grading 0.135 ounces
of gold per ton down the dip of a contact between a diorite intrusive and
dacite volcanics. Drilling to establish the width and length of the high
grade zone indicates that the zone is approximately 100 feet wide, and
is presently open along strike.</P>

<P>Dayton has allocated $5.2 million to its exploration effort in 1996.
Approximately 40,000 feet of rotary and core drilling was completed at
Andacollo during the first half of 1996 with ore grade mineralization encountered
in virtually every hole. A further 30,000 feet of rotary and core drilling
are planned at Andacollo prior to the end of the year at which time an
updated mineable reserve will be completed.</P>

<P>Two of the three new property acquisitions are located near the Andacollo
mine, and are believed to have excellent potential to add additional reserves
in the near term. The third, the Lolita property, is located 100 miles
north of Copiapo and was previously mined as an underground gold mine.
After evaluating several hundred rock samples and nearly 22,000 feet of
core drilling completed by the previous operator, Dayton believes the property
has the potential for a bulk tonnage mining operation. Drilling will commence
immediately on these three properties. </P>

<P>Wayne McClay, Dayton's President and CFO, stated that ``the first half
of 1996 has yielded exciting exploration results and continues to support
our confidence in the outstanding exploration potential of the Andacollo
Gold Mine. As we continue to develop our geological understanding of the
property, we are optimistic that reserves will more than double. With a
cash position in excess of $30 million and strong cash flow from Andacollo,
Dayton is also well positioned to acquire other promising projects to assist
in Dayton's corporate growth.'' Dayton Mining Corporation holds a 100%
interest in the Andacollo Gold Mine located in central Chile. The company
trades on both the American Stock exchange (AMEX) and Toronto Stock Exchange
(TSE) under the trading symbol DAY.</P>

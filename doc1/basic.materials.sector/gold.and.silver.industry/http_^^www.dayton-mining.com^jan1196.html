<hr width="100%" ></p>
<ul>
<p>January 11, 1996 Dayton Mining Corporation is pleased to announce that
an underwriting group led by Nesbitt Burns Inc., and including Scotia McLeod
Inc. and Canaccord Capital Corporation, have entered into an underwriting
agreement to purchase 2,500,000 Special Warrants of Dayton Mining Corporation
at a price of $6.50 per Special Warrant for total proceeds of $16,250,000.
The transaction is subject to regulatory approval. </p>

<p>Each Special Warrant is exercisable into a unit consisting of one common
share plus one- half of a warrant. Each warrant is exercisable at $7.00
per share for 18 months. The proceeds of the offering will be used for
exploration and development, corporate development acquisition and general
corporate purposes. </p>

<p>Wayne McClay, Dayton's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated
that &quot;this financing will enable Dayton to use existing cash flow
from operations to expand the production facilities at the Company's 100%
Andacoflo Gold Mine. In addition the proceeds from the offering will be
used to increase reserves, and to evaluate acquisition opportunities which
will assure the corporate growth of the Company.&quot; </p>

<p>In 1996 Andacollo is expected to produce more them 130,000 ounces of
gold at an operating cost of approximately US$150 per ounce. Total Reserves
are presently 2.2 million ounces of gold, and are expected to increase
as a result of an exploration/drill program currently in progress at the
property. </p>

<p>Dayton Mining Corporation is listed on the American (AMEX) and Toronto
(TSE) Stock Exchanges under the trading symbol; DAY.</p>

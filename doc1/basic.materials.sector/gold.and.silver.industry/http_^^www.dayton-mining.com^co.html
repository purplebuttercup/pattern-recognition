<b>Company Activities:</b>
<p>
Dayton Mining Corporation is a Canadian based international mining company engaged in the worldwide exploration, development and operation of precious metals properties. The Company's principal asset is its 100% owned and operated Andacollo Gold Mine located in central Chile. Andacollo is a 16,000-ton per day open-pit, heap leach operation. Current mine production is from three deposits, Tres Perlas, Tres Perlas West and Socorro Deposits. In the fourth quarter of 1997, crusher through put capacity will be increased to 20,000 tons per day through the installation of a third tertiary crusher. The Andacollo Gold Mine began commercial production on January 1, 1996 and produced 87,650 ounces of gold during that year. Production is expected to increase to 160,000 ounces in 1999. Life of mine cash costs are estimated at US$200 per ounce, making Andacollo a low cost producing mine.
<p>
Andacollo exploration drilling in 1997 has added 280,000 resource ounces grading 1.57 grams of gold per tonne from the Churrumata and Chisperos areas of the property. The interim resource at Andacollo now stands at 3.2 million ounces of gold. Mineable reserves at Andacollo are 1.5 million ounces of gold. A total 21,300 metres drilling has been completed in 120 holes with a finding cost of US$5.30 per resource ounce. Exploration at Andacollo for the remainder of 1997 will focus on the conversion of resources to reserves, extensional exploration away from currently identified resource areas and the identification of new exploration targets. Dayton continues to actively pursue opportunities worldwide using both Dayton personnel and outside consultants.
<p>
Dayton's gold production is hedged at lJS$380 gold until August 1, 1998.
<p>
With a highly skilled management team focussed on growth, a strong treasury of US$80 million and assured cash flow, Dayton Mining is well positioned for future growth through exploration, merger and acquisitions.

<center><h2>SIGNIFICANT RESERVE EXPANSION SUGGESTED BY
EXPLORATION DRILLING AT THE RED LAKE MINE</h2></center>
    
Preliminary exploration drilling results from the lower levels of the Red 
Lake Mine has produced two promising discoveries:  One, a 600 foot vertical
extension of two known main ore zones; and two, a new high grade structure. 
These discoveries will have a positive impact on reserves.<p>
    
<b><i>Background</i></b><p>
    
Prior to 1990, exploration expenditures at the mine were minimal.  An 
aggregate of $6 million is committed for the 1995-96 exploration program.<p>
    
The amalgamation of Goldcorp Inc. and Dickenson Mines Limited in March, 1994
resulted in a larger, well financed company that is capable of comfortably
funding this substantial exploration effort.<p>
    
The principal focus of our 1995-96 exploration program will be in the lower,
unexplored levels (1,500 vertical feet) of the mine.<p>
    
<b><i>Discovery - Main Zones Continue to Depth</i></b><p>
    
In 1994, exploration drilling from the 34 Level revealed the expected 
continuity of two main zones extending from 30 Level (the lowest working 
level) to 34 Level, a vertical distance of 600 feet.  These zones reveal 
widths up to 30 feet with fairly uniform mineralization and gold values 
in the range of 0.25 ounces of gold per ton.  Further confirmation of the 
continuity of these zones was indicated by downholes drilled from 30 
Level.<p>
    
<b><i>Discovery - New High Grade Structure</i></b><p>
    
For the year to date, continuing exploration drilling from the 34 Level has
led to the discovery of new structures, one of which is a well 
mineralized quartz carbonate structure which has returned very 
significant gold assays over a 400 foot dip length.  All assays are supported
by visible coarse and fine gold.<p>

The following table provides assay results for all drill holes to date, 
intersecting this new quartz carbonate structure:<p>

The weighted average grade for the nine reported drill sections is 9.08 
ounces per ton (uncut) over 7.6 feet.<p>
    
<b><i>Major Capital Commitment</i></b><p>
    
In February 1995, a $10 million exploration and development program was 
announced.  This will include 200,000 feet of diamond drilling.  The main 
exploration target is the 1,500 vertical feet between 30 and 40 Levels.  A
total of five drills are currently deployed on Levels 30, 34 and 38.<p>
    
These encouraging preliminary results have reinforced management's belief 
that significant potential for increasing reserves exists both in our Red 
Lake Mine and in our surrounding 21,515 acres.<p>

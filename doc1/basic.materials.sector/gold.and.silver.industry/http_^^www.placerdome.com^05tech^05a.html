	In order to understand the Placer Dome story, basic knowledge of the principles
	behind the recovery of mineral resources is necessary. The following "mining primer" will be
	supplemented periodically with articles addressing technology issues of concern to
	the mining industry.

	Mining is the process of removing ore from its original site beneath
	the earth's surface ("ore" being material that can be mined at a
	profit). However, since there are no "standard" orebodies, there are
	no "standard" mine workings.
	<p>
	
	The nature of the deposit will indicate whether open pit
	or underground extraction will be used. Where an orebody is covered
	by a relatively shallow layer of overburden, open pit mining may be practical
	in the initial stages. This type of mining uses highly mechanized methods
	of earth moving. Its economics are based on moving large tonnages possible
	only in surface operations with giant trucks and shovels. Ore trucks of 
	90- to 180-tonne capacities can be loaded in a few minutes by shovels lifting
	11.5 cubic metres or more at a time. This kind of equipment has significantly
	changed the economic feasibility of previously uneconomic mineral 
	occurrences.
	<p>
	
	Where a thick layer of overburden renders open pit mining impractical, the
	more traditional underground method must be used. Even here, the rapid 
	implementation of modern technology has changed the economics, making
	concentrations of lower grade ore practical to mine. However, the costs of
	sinking shafts or driving adits (a nearly horizontal entrance from the surface)
	to access ore remain high and require that underground mines work 
	with generally higher grade ore than that of open pit mines.
	<p>
	
	Milling is the primary step in the treatment of ore and is usually done at
	the mine. In certain cases, as with some gold ores, this treatment results
	in the extraction of gold dor&#233; bars (which must still be refined) on site. Most base
	metals, however, are found in a complex chemical form which cannot be economically
	converted into metal at the mine. In such cases milling simply extracts or
	concentrates the mineral so that it can be economically shipped to smelting
	and refining facilities.
	<p>
	
	All milling processes begin with the crushing and grinding of ore to a size 
	suitable for subsequent operations. These processes produce a particle 
	that is just small enough to ensure liberation or unlocking of the mineral
	from associated host rock.
	<p>
	
	Crushing, the first stage of this process, reduces the coarse material from the 
	mine to pebble-size in preparation for grinding, the term used to describe 
	the final steps of particle size reduction.
	<p>
	
	Grinding occurs in large, rotating cylinders in which tumbling steel shapes,
	and often ore chunks, crush the pebbles to a fineness which assures mineral
	liberation.
	<p>
	
	Separation processes are designed to remove the fine mineral
	particles from their host rock. Different processes have been
	designed for different minerals, but all are efficient at separating
	small amounts of minerals from masses of waste. For instance,
	typical gold ore in today's mines would average one twentieth of a
	troy ounce (14.583 troy ounces per pound) of the precious metal in
	2,000 pounds of ore. This is a very small ratio indeed, being
	approximately equal to two parts of gold per million parts of rock.
	Yet the modern recovery process is so efficient that many mines can
	drill, blast, load, haul, grind, and treat 20 tonnes of ore to
	recover one ounce of gold, sell it at a market price of, say, US$365
	per ounce, and still record a profit.
	<p>


	Flotation is the most common method of separating base metal minerals, many of which
	were deposited in sulphide compounds. The finely ground ore is mixed with water to
	form a slurry. Certain chemicals or reagents that coat only the desired mineral
	components are added in small amounts. Rising air bubbles capture the coated mineral
	particles and float them to the surface where they are skimmed off to a separate
	circuit. The waste rock, now called tailing, remains in the slurry. This process 
	is capable of increasing the concentration of minerals many times and of separating
	several different minerals from a complex orebody.
	<p>
	
	The shipment of concentrates to smelting and refining plants is the final step in
	the series of events that began with a prospector's interest in a rock sample
	or the flicker of a needle on an electronic instrument.
	<p>
	
	But the story does not end here. Eventually every mine exhausts its ore. The wind-up
	phase then begins: its objective is to prepare the site so that it will remain
	in a safe and stable condition, not very different from the surrounding area.

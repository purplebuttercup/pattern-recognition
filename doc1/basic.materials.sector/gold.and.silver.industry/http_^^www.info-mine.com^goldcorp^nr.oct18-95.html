<center><h2>GOLDCORP EXPLORATION REVEALS RED LAKE
            HIGH GRADE ZONE LONGER THAN FIRST THOUGHT</h2></center>

Goldcorp Inc. (TSE/ME G.A, G.B; NYSE:
GG.A, GG.B) today announced that encouraging new drilling results
from the company's Cdn. $10 million exploration and development
program at its Red Lake Mine indicate the size of the mine's high
grade zone is larger than earlier forecast.<p>
            New drilling at three holes on the 30 and 34 levels of the mine
indicate the main quartz carbonate zone has a minimum strike length
of 800 feet between the 31 and 32 levels. The new drilling has also
revealed improved widths in the zone, with a number of footwall and
hanging wall ore shoots that will be defined by in-fill drilling in
early 1996.<p>
            ``We're pleased with these results which indicate a strike at
least 60 per cent longer than the earlier forecast of 500 feet,''
said Robert McEwen, President and CEO of Goldcorp. ``These numbers
also show the long term strategic soundness of reducing production
levels, beginning in early 1995, to permit increased exploration and
development of the Red Lake Mine.''<p>
            The high grade zone's promising drill results are the latest in
a series of positive results from Red Lake. ``Also of major
importance is our discovery, earlier this year, of the 1,200-foot
vertical continuity of the sulphide zone,'' explained Mr. McEwen.
``Taken together, eventual production from the high grade and
sulphide zones could significantly expand reserves and annual
production.''<p>
            On the deepest level of the mine, the 38 level, assay results
have been received for the sulphide zone and visual examination has
revealed the downward continuity of the quartz carbonate zone with
minor visible gold.<p>
        
           <b> Ongoing Exploration</b><p>
            Expenditures to date  under the  $10 million program total
approximately $5 million.<p>
            The 34 level hanging wall drift has been advanced some 400 feet
(40 per cent of its planned length) to allow drilling for the
downward extension of the high grade quartz carbonate, footwall and
quartz vein zones. A drilling program is just commencing on the 30
level in a newly rehabilitated drift, approximately 1,300 feet west
of the three high grade zones discovered thus far.<p>
            Inconclusive results have come from the 18, 22 and 24 level
exploration activities. Further assay results are pending on some of
the 22 holes drilled to date.<p>
        
           <b>Pre-Feasibility Study</b><p>
            Goldcorp has engaged Kilborn Engineering, a consulting
engineering firm, to conduct a pre-feasibility study which will
examine methods to optimize production from the Red Lake Mine. The
emphasis of the study will be on the newly discovered ore zones and
their integration with existing production. Among the issues to be
examined are mining methods, mining rates, ore handling systems and
plant lay-out. The study is to be completed by the end of 1995.<p>
            Goldcorp Inc. is a well-capitalized intermediate size North
American gold producer with controlling interests in three producing
gold mines in Ontario and South Dakota. In addition to its gold
producing operations, Goldcorp owns two industrial mineral
operations, Havelock Mine in New Brunswick and Saskatchewan Minerals
in Saskatchewan. Goldcorp is headquartered in Toronto and had record
1994 revenues of approximately Cdn. $141 million.<p>

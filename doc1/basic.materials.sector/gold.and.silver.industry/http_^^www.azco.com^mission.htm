		<p>As Chairman of AZCO Mining Inc., I am pleased to share our accomplishments and goals.
		AZCO Mining Inc. has successfully demonstrated our expertise in acquiring and developing significant mining projects as demonstrated by our business transactions such as the sale of our Sanchez mine, and also by the resulting strategic alliance established with Phelps Dodge in 1996.<p>

		<p>AZCO's mission is to create value for its shareholders by generating revenue in excess of US $50 million per year, within four years, by low cost production of copper and gold.</p>

		<p>The potential to realize these goals is significant with regard to two primary points;
		Phelps Dodge is now managing AZCO's copper interests, having signed the life-of-mine exploitation agreement on the Piedras Verdes, and secondly, the recent joint venture on Suaqui Verde.
		AZCO has also commenced a new acquisition and exploration program in two historically rich gold bearing locations.
		These locations are in both the Kenieba gold belt in Mali, West Africa and also in the West Pongkor area, a property strategically located along side of the famous gold producing Pongkor mine in Java, Indonesia.</p>

		<p>AZCO's management team has a proven track record of acquisition, financing, exploring and developing mines of significant value.
		With our current strategic partnership with Phelps Dodge and a strong balance sheet, AZCO is well positioned for the future.</p>

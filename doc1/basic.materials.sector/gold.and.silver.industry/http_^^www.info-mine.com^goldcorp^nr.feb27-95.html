<center><h2>Goldcorp 1994 Consolidated Results</h2></center>
    
<i>(All amounts in this news release are expressed in Canadian dollars 
except as noted otherwise.)</i><p>

Goldcorp Inc. today reported record results for the year 1994:<p>
<ul>    
<li>revenues increased by 18% to $141 million<p>
    
<li>earnings increased by 120% to $30.6 million<p>
    
<li>earnings from operations increased by 55% to $20.4 million<p>
    
<li>cash flow from operations increased by 39% to $35.6 million<p>
    
<li>share of gold production increased by 27% to 127,000 ounces<p>
</ul>

<b>Financial Results</b><p>
    
Earnings for 1994 were $30.6 million, or $1.11 per share ($1.07 per share 
fully diluted) on revenues of $140.9 million.  In 1993, earnings were 
$13.9 million, or 80 cents per share, on revenues of $119.2 million.<p>
    
Earnings for the fourth quarter of 1994 were $1.9 million, or six cents 
per share, on revenues of $34.3 million.  For the same period in 1993, 
earnings were $3.3 million, or 19 cents per share, on revenues of $32.5 
million.<p>
    
Cash flow from operations in 1994 was $35.6 million, or $1.29 per share 
($1.24 per share fully diluted).  In 1993, cash flow from operations was 
$25.7 million, or $1.47 per share.  For the fourth quarter of 1994, cash 
flow from operations was $5.7 million, or 18 cents per share, compared to 
$8.6 million, or 49 cents per share, for the same period in 1993.<p>

The 1994 results reflect the Reorganization, effective March 31, 1994, 
between Goldcorp and its affiliated companies, which resulted in the 
elimination of the minority interest in Dickenson Mines Limited and the 
extinguishment of the investment management agreement between Goldcorp 
and CSA Management Limited.  The Reorganization principally involved 
combining the financial assets of Goldcorp with the operating assets of 
Dickenson and CSA's Goldcorp-related assets.<p>
    
Other factors contributing to the improved results in 1994 were a 5%
    increase in the quantity of gold sold, a 16%
    increase in the realized gold price per
    ounce sold and a non-recurring after-tax
    gain of $20.2 million (70 cents per share
    fully diluted) realized on the sale of
    substantially all of the Company's
    investment in shares of Orvana Minerals
    Corporation.<p>
    
    Goldcorp's hedging program, conducted
    mainly through forward sales, enhanced
    revenues in 1994 and 1993.  Gold sales in
    1994 were 204,294 ounces at an average
    realized price of $545 (US$399) per
    ounce, compared to 194,169 ounces at an
    average realized price of $469 (US$364)
    per ounce in 1993.  During 1994, the
    average market price for gold was $524
    (US$384) per ounce, compared to $464
    (US$360) per ounce in 1993.  The
    Company intends to resume its gold
    hedging program at a price level it deems
    appropriate.<p>
    
   <b>Gold Mining Operations</b><p>
    
    Operating profit in 1994 from gold
    mining operations increased by 45% to
    $19.2 million on revenues of $111.4
    million, compared to $13.3 million on
    revenues of $91.4 million in 1993. 
    Operating cash flow from gold mining
    operations (before changes in non-cash
    working capital) increased by 40% to
    $36.4 million, from $25.9 million in
    1993.<p>
    
    Total gold production from the Red Lake
    Mine, the Wharf Mine and the Golden
    Reward Mine increased by 6% to 223,338
    ounces from 211,539 ounces in 1993. 
    Goldcorp's share of gold production in
    1994 increased by 27% to 127,136 ounces
    from 99,981 ounces in 1993, largely due
    to a reduction in minority interest
    resulting from the Reorganization.<p>
    
    The average cash production cost per
    ounce in 1994 was $334 (US$244),
    compared to $312 (US$242) per ounce in
    1993.  Including cash production cost,
    royalties, severance taxes and non-cash
    costs, the total average cost was $436
    (US$319) in 1994, compared to $404
    (US$313) in 1993.  Overall, the higher
    cash production cost at the Red Lake Mine
    more than offset cost reductions at the
    Golden Reward Mine.<p>

    The estimated total gold production from
    the Company's three gold mines is
    202,000 ounces in 1995, of which
    Goldcorp's share is 117,000 ounces.  The
    estimated average cash production cost is
    $312 (US$231) per ounce and average
    total cost is $435 (US$322) per ounce.<p>
    
    <b><i>Red Lake Mine</b></i><p>
    
    In 1994, the Red Lake Mine recorded an
    operating profit of $4 million, compared
    to $4.7 million in 1993.  Operating cash
    flow in 1994 was $5.2 million, compared
    to $5.4 million in 1993.<p>
    
    The mill throughput during 1994 was
    318,000 tons of ore with an average head
    grade of 0.25 ounces of gold per ton and
    an average recovery rate of 81.4%.  By
    comparison, in 1993, mill throughput was
    335,000 tons of ore with an average head
    grade of 0.27 ounces of gold per ton and an
    average recovery rate of 80.3%. 
    Consequently, gold production declined to
    65,500 ounces in 1994 from 73,609
    ounces in 1993.  The cash production cost
    in 1994 was $444 (US$325) per ounce,
    compared to $386 (US$299) per ounce in
    1993.  The total cost in 1994, including
    cash production cost and non-cash costs,
    was $478 (US$350), compared to $413
    (US$320) per ounce in 1993.<p>
    
    The lower throughput in 1994 resulted
    from the decision, early in the year, to
    reduce the number of stopes available for
    mining, in order to increase the rate of
    mine development.  The higher level of
    mine development also partly contributed
    to the increase in unit cost in 1994. 
    During 1994, underground development
    increased by 66% to 13,860 feet, from
    8,360 feet in 1993, while underground
    diamond drilling increased by 35% to
    110,000 feet, from 81,200 feet in 1993.<p>
    
    Stoping will continue throughout the
    mine, as numerous small, higher grade
    zones in the upper levels remain to be
    mined.  In order to meet the longer term
    objectives of the mine, it is necessary to
    better define the ore reserve base prior to
    stoping.  Approximately 130,000 feet of
    development drilling is planned over the
    next two years at a cost of $4 million.  In
    addition, 15,000 feet of underground
    development is planned for 1995 above
    the 30 Level.<p>
    
    The Company has commenced a $6
    million exploration program at the mine,
    which will include 200,000 feet of
    diamond drilling over the next two years. 
    This program will be conducted between
    the 30 and 38 Levels and is the
    continuation of exploration drilling
    initiated in 1993 between the 30 and 34
    Levels.  Initial exploration results show
    strong continuity of gold bearing
    structures from the 30 and 34 Levels. 
    Several good intersections have been
    encountered, which indicate that the
    mineralized structure around the 30
    Level in the current mining area extends
    down to the 34 Level, and potentially
    deeper.  Cross-cuts and drill stations are
    being developed in order to continue the
    drilling of mineralized zones.  The
    Number Two Shaft, with 150 feet of
    vertical footage per level, provides access
    to these areas.<p>
    
    In order to facilitate this significant
    increase in development and exploration,
    the production rate is being reduced from
    1,000 tons to 650 tons per day, which will
    result in budgeted gold output of 50,000
    ounces in 1995, compared to 65,500
    ounces produced in 1994.  The workforce
    at the mine has consequently been
    reduced from 283 employees to 234 in
    February 1995.  The 1995 budgeted cash
    production cost is $410 (US$305) per
    ounce and the total cost is $460
    (US$340) per ounce.<p>
    
    The planned capital expenditures for the
    mine during 1995 are $8 million,
    comprising $2 million for equipment and
    $6 million for exploration and
    development expenditures.<p>
    
    <b><i>Wharf Mine</b></i><p>
    
    In 1994, the Company recorded an
    operating profit of $16.3 million from the
    Wharf Mine, a 47% increase from $11.1
    million a year earlier.  The operating cash
    flow of $26.1 million in 1994 was 31%
    higher than the $19.9 million recorded in
    1993.<p>
    
    The cash production cost of $266
    (US$195) per ounce in 1994 was higher
    than $232 (US$180) per ounce in 1993,
    due to a lower grade of ore processed and
    a higher stripping ratio.  The total cost per
    ounce was $395 (US$289) in 1994,
    compared to $357 (US$277) in 1993. 
    During 1994, the quantity of ore
    processed increased to 4.4 million tons
    with an average grade of 0.030 ounces of
    gold per ton, compared to 4 million tons
    with an average grade of 0.033 ounces of
    gold per ton in 1993.<p>
    
    In 1995, the mine plans to process 4.3
    million tons of ore, with an average grade
    of 0.029 ounces of gold per ton.  The
    estimated gold production is 103,000
    ounces at a cash production cost of $263
    (US$195) per ounce and at a total cost of
    $397 (US$294) per ounce.<p>
    
    The 1995 planned capital expenditures
    include $1 million for equipment
    replacement, with a further $3.5 million
    for exploration and development.<p>
    
    <b><i>Golden Reward Mine</b></i><p>
    
    In 1994, Goldcorp recorded an
    unexpected operating loss of $1 million
    from the Golden Reward Mine, compared
    to an operating loss of $2.5 million in
    1993.  The mine continued, however, to
    generate a positive operating cash flow in
    1994, of which Goldcorp's recorded share
    increased significantly to $5.1 million
    from $0.6 million in 1993.<p>
    
    During the second half of 1994, shallow
    surface cracks appeared on the walls of
    East Liberty Pit.  These cracks were not
    adverse to continued mining.  However, a
    100-year record rain storm in October
    caused additional surface cracks and
    exacerbated those that already existed. 
    The occurrence of these cracks
    jeopardized the stability of the East
    Liberty Pit walls.<p>
    
    Mining at East Liberty Pit was
    discontinued and backfilling of the pit has
    stabilized the walls.  As a consequence,
    permitted contained gold reserves have
    been reduced by approximately 170,000
    ounces (Goldcorp's share was 102,000
    ounces).  Accordingly, Goldcorp recorded
    a charge of $1.8 million against its share
    of earnings from the Golden Reward
    Mine, which is attributable to its share of
    affected reserves.<p>
    
    In 1994, gold production at the Golden
    Reward Mine increased by 48% to 52,556
    ounces, from 35,549 ounces in 1993
    (Goldcorp's share of production was
    31,534 ounces and 21,329 ounces,
    respectively).  The 1994 cash production
    cost of $332 (US$243) per ounce was
    23% lower than the $430 (US$333) per
    ounce in 1993.  The total cost per ounce in
    1994 was $491 (US$359), compared to
    $591 (US$458) in 1993.  Cost savings
    from the purchase of the life-of-mine
    mining contract from the mining
    contractor in 1993 and a higher grade of
    ore processed resulted in higher
    production and a lower cost per ounce in
    1994.  During 1994, the quantity of ore
    processed increased to 1.8 million tons
    with an average grade of 0.040 ounces of
    gold per ton, compared to 1.5 million tons
    with an average grade of 0.033 ounces of
    gold per ton in 1993.<p>
    
    For 1995, the Golden Reward Mine is
    expected to break even and generate an
    operating cash flow at the same level as
    1994, based on the gold price of US$375
    per ounce.  The 1995 budgeted gold
    production is 48,000 ounces (Goldcorp's
    share is 29,000 ounces) at a cash
    production cost of $304 (US$225) per
    ounce and a total cost of $521 (US$386)
    per ounce.  The throughput planned in
    1995 is 1.7 million tons of ore with an
    average grade of 0.038 ounces of gold per
    ton.<p>
    
    Expenditures of $4.3 million (Goldcorp's
    share is $2.6 million) are planned for
    1995, mainly for mine development and
    definition drilling.<p>
    
    <b><i>Clinton Project</b></i><p>
    
    The Clinton Project, adjoining the east
    side of the currently permitted Wharf
    Mine, has estimated contained gold
    reserves of one million ounces, all of
    which are amenable to open pit mining. 
    Work on the permit applications for
    development of the project is expected to
    be completed in late 1996.  The proximity
    of the Clinton Project to existing
    treatment and mining facilities will be
    beneficial to the future development of
    this deposit.<p>
    
    <b><i>Industrial Mineral Operations</b></i><p>
    
    In 1994, combined revenues from
    Havelock Lime and Saskatchewan
    Minerals increased by 6% to $29.5 million
    from $27.8 million in 1993.  Operating
    profit was $6.5 million in 1994,
    compared to $7.1 million in 1993. 
    Operating cash flow was $8.6 million in
    1994, compared to $9.1 million in 1993.<p>
    
    The industrial mineral operations
    benefitted from the weak Canadian dollar
    as 64% of 1994 revenues was from export
    sales of industrial mineral products.  This
    favourable factor, however, was more
    than offset by higher operating costs,
    which resulted in lower operating profit
    and cash flow in 1994.<p>
    
    Sales forecasts for processed sodium
    sulphate and lime products for 1995 are
    consistent with 1994 levels.<p>
    
    <b>Investment Portfolio</b><p>
    
    The strong market for gold bullion and
    gold related securities that began in early
    1993 and ended in the first half of 1994
    allowed Goldcorp the opportunity to
    realize substantial gains on its
    investments in certain gold securities,
    particularly during 1994.<p>
    
    During 1994, the Company realized pre-
    tax gains of $39 million ($21.7 million
    after tax), consisting of a gain of $36.3
    million on the sale of 6,090,000 shares of
    Orvana Minerals Corporation and $2.7
    million on the sale of other investments. 
    In 1993, pre-tax net gains were $11.5
    million.<p>
    
    At December 31, 1994, the Company's
    remaining investment portfolio in gold
    securities had an aggregate market value
    of $25.4 million, which exceeded the
    carrying book value by 51%, or $8.6
    million.  These holdings remain as
    available sources of additional capital for
    future mine expansion and joint venture
    opportunities.<p>
    
    <b>Reserves</b><p>
    
    At December 31, 1994, the aggregate
    contained gold reserves at the Red Lake
    Mine, the Wharf Mine and the Golden
    Reward Mine was 3,487,000 ounces,
    compared to a total of 4,058,000 ounces
    in 1993.<p>
    
    At December 31, 1994, Goldcorp's share
    of the estimated contained gold reserves
    from the Red Lake Mine, the Wharf Mine
    and the Golden Reward Mine was
    2,222,000 ounces.  These reserves
    include permitted reserves of 1,612,000
    ounces and 610,000 ounces of
    unpermitted reserves.  A gold price of
    US$375 per ounce was used to calculate
    these reserves.<p>
    
    Goldcorp's share of total gold reserves at
    December 31, 1994 increased by 22%
    from 1,823,000 at December 31, 1993,
    principally as a result of the merger of
    Goldcorp and Dickenson Mines in March
    1994 and the accompanying reduction in
    minority interests in the reserves.<p>

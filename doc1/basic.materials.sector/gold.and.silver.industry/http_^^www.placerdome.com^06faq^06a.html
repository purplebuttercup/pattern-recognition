	<strong>
	Why does Placer Dome mine gold?</strong></a>
	<p>
	
	Gold is a metal which is traded on world markets, with individual buyers and
	sellers generally unable to exert significant influence over pricing or quantities
	sold.  Gold is used primarily in the fabrication of jewelry.  Other uses include
	electronics and coin fabrication, dentistry and decorative applications.  There is
	also significant demand for gold as an investment.

	<strong>
	What else does Placer Dome mine?</strong></a>
	<p>
	

	<strong>
	Silver
	</strong>
	<br>

	Silver is a metal which is traded on world markets, with individual buyers and
	sellers generally unable to exert significant influence over pricing or quantities
	sold. Silver is used in photography, jewelry, electrical equipment, mirrors,
	tableware, brazing alloys, coins and commemorative medals.  Most silver production
	is undertaken in tandem with, or as a byproduct of, lead/zinc, copper and gold
	mining operations. Placer Dome markets its silver to international buyers
	on a spot market basis and through forward sales contracts and other hedging
	instruments.
	<p>

	<strong>
	Copper
	</strong>
	<br>

	Copper is used in telecommunications, automobiles, construction and
	consumer durables.  Activity in these areas influences the price of
	copper.  Copper concentrates produced by the Osborne Mine are
	marketed to smelters in Japan and the Philippines. Electrowon copper
	cathode, produced at the Zald&#237;var Mine, is marketed to Japan and
	Europe.

	<strong>
	How do you know where to look for gold?</strong></a>
	<p>


	Exploration is the heart of gold mining. Placer Dome's exploration strategy
combines the acquisition of promising "middle to advanced stage" properties
with generative and grassroots exploration. This ensures a steady supply of
projects with potential to maintain long-term growth in gold production.

	<p>

	Placer Dome North America -- based in Vancouver, BC -- leads Placer
Dome's exploration programme by evaluating opportunities and directing
activities around the world. The newest exploration office opened in C&#244;te
d'Ivoire, in West Africa. In South America, exploration offices are located
in Brazil, Chile, Peru and Venezuela. In Australia, there are exploration
offices in Brisbane, and in Belmont, near Perth. In the Pacific and Asia
region, exploration offices are in Fiji, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and
the Philippines. In North America, U.S. exploration offices are in Elko and
Reno, Nevada, and in Anchorage, Alaska. In Canada, <A HREF="http://web20.mindlink.net/pdxgeophysics"> exploration offices</A> are
located in Kamloops, British Columbia, Red Lake, Timmins and Toronto,
Ontario, and Val d'Or, Quebec. Operating mines also explore on their own
mine properties or venture areas for new discoveries.

	<strong>

	Australia and Papua New Guinea (30%),  United States (17%) and Latin America (6%). 
	Production outside North America and Australia was 27% in 1996, 31% in 1995, 35% in 1994, 35%

	<strong>
	What is Placer Dome doing about protecting the environment?</strong></a>
	<p>

	The mining industry is subject to stringent environmental regulations.  All of
	Placer Dome's activities, from exploration through reclamation, are subject to
	legislation.  Government regulation of the industry requires extensive monitoring
	activities and contingency planning for accidental discharges into the
	environment.
	<p>

	Placer Dome's environmental policy is reviewed annually and revised as required to
	provide the basis for maintaining the Corporation's position as an environmental
	leader.  The latest revision was approved by the Board of Directors on February
	18, 1994.  In support of this policy Placer Dome has established a comprehensive
	environmental management system, standards and guidelines which apply to all
	regions and activities including operations, development and exploration. 
	Improvements are made to all systems on a regular basis in keeping with the major
	principles underlying the environmental policy.

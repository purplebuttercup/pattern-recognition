December 21, 1995<br>
Toronto, Canada<p>

Goldcorp Inc. (TSE/ME: G.A, G.B; NYSE: GG.A, GG.B) today announced new drilling 
results from the company's Red Lake Mine which have improved the quality of and 
increased the size of the main high grade quartz carbonate zone and indicated
potential new high grade zones at depth.<p>
            Since Goldcorp's last update, 24 holes were drilled in the
deepest levels of the mine. Between the 30 and 34 levels, five holes
were drilled that returned gold values. One of these holes assayed
greater than 29 ounces per ton (uncut).<p>
            Below the 34 level, 10 holes were drilled to explore for the
downward extension of the high grade quartz carbonate zone. Visual
examination of the cores from the seven steeper holes, reveals an
apparent shift in the position of the quartz carbonate zone. These
holes were originally drilled to test for the extension of the zone
450 feet below the 34 level but as a result of the shift, intercepts
of ore grade mineralization were made at approximately 200 feet.
Assays are pending on three holes. Further drilling is planned to
test for the eastern extension of the deeper structure.<p>
            Assay results from three of the 10 holes indicate continuity to
approximately 100 feet below the 34 level. The intercept widths
ranged from 10 to 33 feet while the grade ranged between 2.5 and 4.8
ounces per ton.<p>
            Two of these three holes also encountered narrow footwall zones.
In one of the footwall zones the assay grade was 31.3 ounces per ton.<p>
            Assays are pending for seven of the 10 holes drilled on the 30
level. Three holes drilled in a northerly direction from the west end
of the drift encountered mineralization with grades ranging between
0.25 to 8.94 ounces per ton over narrow widths. Further drilling will
test for continuations of structure. Additional drilling has just
commenced into the hanging wall at the west end of the 30 level
drift, looking for continuations in a southerly direction.<p>
            ``Our confidence in the high grade zone and its possible
extension to depth has been strengthened by these results,'' said
Robert McEwen, President and Chief Executive Officer of Goldcorp Inc.
``It is increasingly apparent that our ongoing exploration success
will have a major positive impact on Red Lake's production.''<p>
            Goldcorp will continue its exploration and development program
throughout 1996. At the same time, the company awaits a
pre-feasibility study by Kilborn Engineering which will examine a
number of issues including mining methods in the high grade zone.<p>

Goldcorp Inc. is an intermediate size, North American gold producer. The Company controls two producing gold mines: its wholly owned, underground Red Lake Mine, situated in northwestern Ontario; and one open pit mine located in the Black Hills of South Dakota - the Wharf Mine. Goldcorp controls the Wharf Mine through its wholly owned subsidiary, Wharf Resources Ltd., which owns 100% of the Wharf Mine and 60% of the non-producing Golden Reward Mine.<P>

At December 31, 1996, the aggregate contained gold reserves at the Red Lake Mine and the Wharf Mine were 3,684,000 ounces. This share of reserves includes permitted reserves of 2,951,000 ounces and 1,093,000 ounces of unpermitted reserves.<P>

In 1997, the estimated total gold production from the two producing gold mines is 104,000 ounces. The estimated cash production cost is US$230 per ounce and the total cost is US$347 per ounce.<P>

Goldcorp also owns two industrial mineral operations: Havelock Lime, which produces limestone and lime products in New Brunswick; and Saskatchewan Minerals, which produces sodium sulphate from two operations in southern Saskatchewan. These two operations each have more than 30 years of reserves.<P>

In February 1995, Goldcorp announced the discovery of a new high grade zone at its Red Lake Mine.  Subsequent exploration drilling has outlined a resource of 1.9 million ounces. The zone continues to be extended to the east and to depth. By 1998, Goldcorp expects to triple the annual production rate at its Red Lake Mine from 50,000 to 150,000 ounces at a cash operating cost of US$150 per ounce.<P>

An investment portfolio is maintained by Goldcorp, and is available as a source of additional capital for future mine expansion and joint venture opportunities.<P>

Earnings in 1996 were $11.8 million, or $0.19 per share, on revenues of $125.6 million. Working capital at December 31, 1996 was $59.9 million.<P>

CSA Management Inc. holds approximately 17% of Goldcorp's shares.<P>

Goldcorp's shares are listed on the Toronto and Montreal stock exchanges under the symbols "G.A" and "G.B", and on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbols "GG.A" and "GG.B".<P>

Goldcorp is included in the Toronto Stock Exchange 200 and 300 indices.<P>

<p>The Company's 100% owned Andacollo Gold Mine commenced commercial operations
on January 1, 1996, and produced 22,159 ounces of gold during the first
quarter of 1996. Cash operating costs were slightly under budget at US$163
per ounce of gold. By March 31, 1996 2.7 million tons of ore had been placed
on the leach pad containing 62,700 recoverable ounces of gold. Gold production
is expected to increase each quarter into 1997 as the 120 day leach cycle
approaches a steady state, and current and planned increases in crusher
throughput take effect. </p>

<p>Dayton Mining Corporation is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange in
Canada and the American Stock Exchange in the United States under the trading
symbol DAY.</p>

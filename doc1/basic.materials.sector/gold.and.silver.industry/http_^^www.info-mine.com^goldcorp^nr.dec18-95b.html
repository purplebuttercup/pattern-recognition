December 18, 1995<br>
Toronto, Canada<p>

Goldcorp Inc today announced that its 50.3% owned subsidiary, Wharf Resources Ltd, 
has recorded an after tax writedown of its investment in the
Golden Reward Mine of US$9.5 million. The writedown was made because
of increased uncertainties arising from the proximity of Golden
Reward Mine's unpermitted reserves to a ski hill and to a cemetery.
Total reserves affected by the writedown are 314,000 ounces of gold,
of which Wharf's 60% interest is 188,000 ounces.<p>
            The permitted reserves at the Golden Reward Mine will be
depleted by the end of 1996. During 1996, exploration will continue
on the property for additional reserves that may be amenable to open
pit or underground mining. After the remaining reserves are depleted
and until new reserves are located and permitted and/or existing
reserves permitted, the Golden Reward Mine will be kept on a care and
maintenance basis.<p>
            The writedown will reduce Goldcorp's earnings for the year ended
December 31, 1995 by $7.9 million or $0.25 per share.<p>

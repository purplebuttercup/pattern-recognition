        and its 52% owned subsidiary Crested Crop. (OTC Bulletin
        Board &quot;CBAG&quot;) doing business as the joint
        venture &quot;USECC&quot;, reported today that they
        received an order from the three member arbitration panel
        initiated by Nukem, Inc. of Stamford, CT
        (&quot;Nukem&quot;) and its 100% owend subsidiary Cycle
        Resouce Investment Company (&quot;CRIC) concerning the
        Sheep Mountain Partners (&quot;SMP&quot;) uranium
        operation in sWyoming. The SMP Partnership was formed in
        December 1988 between USECC and Nukem?CRIC to develop and
        mine uranium ore from the SMP mines in Wyoming to be
        milled into uranium concentrates (U3O8) and market (U308)
        worldwide. Disputes arose between the partners and
        arbitration proceedings were commenced by Nukem/CRIC in
        June 1991. Hearing on a consensual arbitration involving
        the parties were commenced on June 27, 1994 and comsumed
        some 73 hearing days which ended May 31, 1995.<p>On April
        18, 1996, the Panel awarded USECC a net of approximately
        $7,400,000 in damagesagainst Nuhem. An amount of
        $4,800,000 was also awarded to USECC from funds held in
        SMP bank accounts for a total of $12,200,000. USECC
        reported on April 22, 1996, that additional amounts of
        cash and significant sources of low price uranium may
        also be available to SMP as a result of the Award.<br>
        <a href="#top"><font size="1">BACK TO THE TOP</font></a><i><br>
        </i></p>
        <p>USECC petitioned the U.S. District Court in Colorado
        for confirmation of the award andNukem filed two motions
        to set aside portions of the Award, alleging that
        significant portions of the Award were erroneous. Nukem
        was seeking to set aside potentially $16 million which
        the Panel had awarded USECC. On May 31, 1996, the Court
        remanded the Award to the Panel for consideration of
        these motions. On July 3, 1996, the Panel entered a new
        order affirming its earlier Award stating that,
        &quot;There was wrongdoing on the part of Nukem when it
        used what were clearly partnership contracts to obtain
        financial benefits for itself alone ...Our Award .,. is
        premised upon wrongdoing by Nukem and a judgment by us
        that Nukem ought not to be permitted to profit from that
        wrongful conduct.&quot; The Panel affirmed the Order
        awarding SMP the rights to purchase CIS uranium, the
        uranium acquired pursuant to those rights and the profits
        therefrom which are impressed with a constructive trust
        in favor of SMP. The Panel further stated, &quot;We thus
        conclude that there is no inconsistency and no double
        recovery and no subtraction that ought to be made from
        profits already realized .. .&quot;</p>
        <p>The Panel did correct a portion of the award to
        reimburse J137,700 to CRIC for U,O, itpurchased, out of a
        bank account in Riverton, WY. The Panel also confirmed a
        correction to have the $136,500 previously awarded to
        USECC paid out of the First Interstate Bank of Riverton
        account rather than the Norwest account in Denver, CO.
        USECC calleda mathematical error to the Panel's attention
        which was made by Nukem after the close of evidence in
        the amount of $265,313.83. The Panel did not consider the
        issue and it remains for the U.S. District Court to
        resolve that issue.</p>
        <p>In addition to the Petition for Confirmation of the
        Award, USECC also Ned a petition forappointment of a
        receiver for the SMP partnership and motions to dissolve
        the partnership and for an order directing distribution
        of the escrowed proceeds in the SMP account. These
        matters are expected be considered by the Court in the
        near future.<br>

        <p>John L. Larsen, President of <font color="#000080"><strong>U.S.
        Energy Corp.</strong></font> said, &quot;After 5 years
        since Nukem/CRIC firstfiled its action for arbitration,
        we now have the final order and award of the Arbitration
        Panel. With the price of uranium concentrates (U,O,)
        improving over the last six months from $12.00/lb. to
        $16.60/lb U,O, last week, U.S. Energy Corp. and its
        affiliates are looking forward to being in the production
        of U,O,. The money we expect to receive within the near
        future will be used to put the Shootaring Canyon Uranium
        Mill in Utah on line by late 1996 or early 1997&quot;.
        Mr.Larsen went on to add, &quot;that, in his opinion,
        because the shares of U.S. Energy are undervalued in the
        market place in comparison with its asset base he would
        discuss with the Board of Directors the possibility of
        some portion of the Award being used to repurchase U.S.
        Energy shares ~om the open market&quot;.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY
ALLOCATES $5.46 MILLION GRANT TO METAL RECOVERY TECHNOLOGIES
AFTER POSITIVE REVIEW OF ZINC RECOVERY PROCESS</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>--Monies To Be Used To Build
New Facility--</b></font></p>

<p>Metal Recovery Technologies<font size="4">, </font><font
size="3">Inc</font><font size="4"> </font>the world&#146;s first
commercial zinc recycler, announced today that after a
performance review of its East Chicago steel-scrap dezincing
facility, the Department of Energy (DOE) and Argonne National
Laboratory have confirmed the availability of $5.46 million to be
used towards developing a &quot;commercial demonstration
plant&quot; and to further develop its zinc recovery process.</p>

<p>To date, the Department of Energy has granted $1.4 million to
Metal Recovery for research and development efforts regarding its
proprietary dezincing process.</p>

<p>In anticipation of the award, Metal Recovery Technologies has
completed a detailed architectural and engineering schematic for
the new facility and will entertain proposals from potential
customers through the remainder of July to determine where the
plant is to be built.</p>

<p>Among possible customers for the new facility is General
Motors Corporation who requested a proposal for a
100,000-to250,000-ton per annum plant in February of this year.</p>

<p>&quot;Our objective now is to sign a Letter of Intent with a
customer before the end of August,&quot; stated Michael Lucas,
chairman of Metal Recovery Technologies, Inc. &quot;We anticipate
that the grant monies coupled with our completed architectural
drawings will speed our negotiations and expect to sign a
contract with a customer before the end of October, 1997.&quot;</p>

<p>Metal Recovery Technologies utilizes a patent-pending process
that removes zinc from galvanized steel scrap yielding two end
products: 99.8 percent pure zinc, and the highest quality
reusable scrap steel. The dezincing technology has been developed
by Metal Recovery Technologies in partnership with the Argonne
National Laboratory and the United States Department of Energy.</p>

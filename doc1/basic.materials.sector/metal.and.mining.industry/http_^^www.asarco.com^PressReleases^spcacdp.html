Preble said that theexpansion will greatly reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from the smelter and willsubstantially improve on the ambient air quality in and around the city of Ilo.  Theexpanded acid plant will increase the sulfur capture at the Ilo smelter from 18% to 30%and will also increase sulfuric acid production at the smelter from an estimated 180,000tons in 1996 to 300,000 tons per year in 1998, the expected first full year of expandedplant operation.  <p>	Preble said SPCC's board of directors this morning approved immediatecommencement of the project with a planned start-up in December, 1997.  The currentacid plant was designed to be expanded and will readily accommodate the additionalequipment.  <p>	SPCC also utilizes an Intermittent Control Plan (ICP) to supplement the use ofthe sulfuric acid plant to reduce emissions during adverse weather conditions bycurtailing production at the smelter.<p>	Expansion of the acid plant is the most recent in a series of capital investmentprojects undertaken by Southern Peru Copper Corporation to improve the environment inits operating areas.  SPCC earlier constructed a waste water processing plant for its Ilocamp, installed the existing acid plant and is building a new on-shore tailingsimpoundment.  <p>	SPCC is the largest mining company in Peru and operates two mines, a smelterand a refinery in the southern region of Peru, employing approximately 5,000 people. SPCC is listed on both the New York and the Lima Stock Exchanges (PCU). Shareholders in SPCC are ASARCO Incorporated (NYSE:AR) (54.1%); a subsidiary ofthe Marmon Corporation (15.0%); Phelps Dodge Overseas Capital Corporation (13.9%)and common shareholders (17.0%).  </TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE WIDTH=550 BORDER=0><TR>	<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP COLSPAN=2>	<P><BR><BR>		<FONT COLOR="#633100"><FONT SIZE="-2">			FOR FURTHER INFORMATION:<BR>			Jerry W.

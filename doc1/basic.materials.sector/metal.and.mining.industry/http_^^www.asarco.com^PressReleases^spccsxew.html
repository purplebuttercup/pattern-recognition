He said thissymbolizes the confidence the business sector and employees have in the fiscal disciplineand cohesion with which the country's economy is being managed.<p>	Charles G. Preble, president of SPCC, said at the ceremony that the SX/EWinstallation would produce 40,000 tons per year of copper cathodes, an increase of 15%in SPCC's production and 9% in national production.<p>	The SX/EW plant was constructed at a cost of US$103 million and will recovercopper from low grade deposits from the mine at Toquepala and from oxide ores at theCuajone mine.<p>	The product produced by the SX/EW plant is copper cathode with 99.999% purityat an approximate weight of 50 kilograms and is highly esteemed for its quality on theworld market.<p>	Various regional and government authorities were present at the ceremonies,including the Minister for Labor Jorge Gonzalez lzquierdo, the Vice Minister of Mining,Juan Mendoza, members of Congress and mayors from<strong> </strong>the southern region of thecountry, as well as Mons. Hugo Garaycoa, the Bishop of Moquegua and Tacna, whoblessed the installations.<p>	Preble announced that SPCC has been studying an increase in its mining capacityby 70% to take advantage of new mineral reserves at its mines at Toquepala andCuajone.  Plans are being made for new investments and an expansion program whichwill enable Southern Peru to produce up to 500,000 short tons of copper annually in thefuture.<p>	Preble also said that work is currently underway to expand SPCC's Sulfuric Acidplant, inaugurated at the beginning of this year at the Ilo smelter.  The new installationwill increase production of sulfuric acid from 150,000 to 272,000 tons per year at aninvestment cost of US$35 million.  The expansion also will enable SPCC to increase thecollection of sulfur dioxide in the copper smelting process from 18% to 30%, improvingthe company s environmental protection programs.<p>	The SX/EW plant was financed with loans from the Corporacion Andina deFomento (CAF) and Southern Peru's own resources.  SPCC is the largest miningcompany in Peru and among the eight largest copper producers in the world.  Thecompany employs 5,000 people and operates the mines at Toquepala and Cuajone, aswell as a smelter and refinery at Ilo.<p>	Shareholders of Southern Peru Copper Corporation are ASARCO Incorporated(NYSE:AR) (54.1%); a subsidiary of the Marmon<strong> </strong>Corporation (15.0%); Phelps DodgeOverseas Capital Corporation (l3.9%) and common shareholders (17.0%).

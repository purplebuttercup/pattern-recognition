Also attending thededication were state ministers, congressmen, local authorities, Monsignor HugoGaraycoa, bishop for Tacna and Moquegua; Richard de J. Osborne, chairman, presidentand chief executive officer of ASARCO Incorporated and a director of SPCC, andCharles G. Preble, president of SPCC.<p>	In remarks prepared for the dedication, President Fujimori said that theconstruction of the Sulfuric Acid Plant reflects confidence in his government.  He saidthat the possible new investment of $500 million in a new smelter announced by SPCCpresident Charles G. Preble responds to this climate of confidence in the privateinvestment policies currently in place.  He also said that foreign investment is welcomeand mentioned the interest of Asarco in developing mining projects in Peru.<p>	Speaking on behalf of SPCC, Charles G. Preble said,  With an investment of $103million, Southern Peru has modernized its Ilo Smelter with a new Sulfuric Acid Plant andthe installation of a new furnace technology, called Modified El Teniente Converter. This installation permitted closing of a reverberatory furnace which operated withoutinterruption in the Smelter during 30 years and cessation of operation of two older-designconverter furnaces.  With this new modern equipment, emissions from old equipmenthave been reduced.   <p>	Preble also said that Southern Peru has initiated studies which could lead toexpansion of its mines and construction of a new smelter at Ilo which would provideworld standard environmental controls.  Construction of the Ilo smelter would takeseveral years and would cost more than $500 million.<p>	After two years of planning and construction, the Sulfuric Acid Plant began initialstart-up in September and currently is producing 530 tons of acid per day.  The new plantemploys the best international standard of technology and will capture approximately18% of the sulfur dioxide emissions from the Ilo smelter.  When fully operational, theplant will be capable of producing 175,000 tons of sulfuric acid per year.  SPCC plans touse a portion of the sulfuric acid in its SX/EW operation at its Toquepala and Cuajonemines and expects to sell the remainder on the open market.  <p>	The acid plant is one of several substantial environmental projects undertakenrecently by SPCC.  A new tailings storage facility will begin operation in late 1996 and aplant for treatment of waste waters from the Ilo Employee Camp has been completed.  Intotal SPCC will spend $135 million on environmental expenditures.  <p>	SPCC is the largest mining company in Peru and one of the 10 largest coppermining companies in the world.  It owns and operates two mines, a smelter and a refineryin the southern region of Peru, employing approximately 5,000 people.  In 1994, itproduced from its mines 267,800 short tons of copper, 3.0 million ounces of silver and6.1 million pounds of molybdenum.   Shareholders in SPCC, which is now publiclyowned and traded on the New York  and Lima Stock Exchanges, are ASARCOIncorporated (NYSE:AR) (54.1%); a subsidiary of the Marmon Corporation (17.7%); Phelps Dodge Overseas Capital Corporation (13.9%) and common shareholders (14.3%).</TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE WIDTH=550 BORDER=0><TR>	<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP COLSPAN=2>	<P><BR><BR>		<FONT COLOR="#633100"><FONT SIZE="-2">			FOR FURTHER INFORMATION:<BR>			Jerry W.

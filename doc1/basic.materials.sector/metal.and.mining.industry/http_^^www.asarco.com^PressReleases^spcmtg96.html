That was the message from SPCCPresident and Chief Executive Officer Charles G. Preble at SPCC s shareholder meetinghere yesterday.<p>	At the meeting, common stockholders of SPCC elected Ambassador Everett E.Briggs, president of the Americas Society and the Council of the Americas, and John F.McGillicuddy, former chairman of the board and chief executive officer of ChemicalBanking Corporation, to represent them for one-year terms.  Common shareholders havea 17.0% interest in SPCC.<p>	Elected directors by the Class A Common Stockholders were Richard de J.Osborne, Kevin R. Morano, Augustus B. Kinsolving, Francis R. McAllister, Robert J.Muth, Robert M. Novotny, Michael O. Varner, David B. Woodbury, Jay A. Pritzker,Robert A. Pritzker, Douglas C. Yearley, J. Steven Whisler and Charles G. Preble.  ClassA Common Stock is held by the founding shareholders of SPCC.  ASARCO Incorporatedholds 54.1% of SPCC, a subsidiary of the Marmon Corporation owns 15.0% and PhelpsDodge Overseas Trading Company owns 13.9%.<p>	Coopers &amp; Lybrand was elected to serve as independent auditors for theCompany.<p>	Preble told shareholders that in 1995 SPCC accomplished a major corporaterestructuring with the issuance of new common shares in exchange for existing laborshares; completed most of its $445-million expansion and modernization program anddoubled its proven and probable copper ore reserves.<p>	SPCC s 1995 net earnings before nonrecurring items were $217.8 million, or$3.31 per share, compared with $78.6 million in 1994, or $1.20 per share.  Nonrecurringitems of $12.6 million in 1994 related to sales of noncore assets.  Earnings in the firstquarter of 1996 were $49.1 million, or 61 cents per common share, compared withproforma earnings of $52.5 million for the first quarter of 1995, or 65 cents per share,adjusted to reflect the labor share exchange as if it had occurred on January 1, 1995.<p>	The Board of Directors declared a dividend of 30 cents per common sharepayable June 3, 1996 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 16, 1996.<p>	According to Preble, Southern Peru successfully completed its offer to exchangenew common shares for existing labor shares at the end of 1995.  Labor shares had beenissued to workers beginning in the 1970s under prior Peruvian law and were activelytraded on the Lima Stock Exchange.  More than 80% of the total labor shares wereexchanged and SPCC common shares now are traded both on the New York StockExchange and the Lima Stock Exchange.  <p>	Preble said that SPCC is nearing completion of its $445-million capital spendingprogram which is designed to integrate the Company s operations, expand production,modernize equipment and add additional environmental facilities.<p>	SPCC s purchase of the government s Ilo refinery made SPCC an integratedcopper producer and lowered the Company cash cost of producing copper by more than 5cents per pound.  <p>	Steps also have been taken to expand production.  Preble said,  New SX/EWfacilities are now in operation and we produced our first cathode in the fourth quarter of1995.  We expect to produce 40,000 tons of copper per year at a cost of under 30 centsper pound, which will reduce our total average costs by five cents a pound.  SPCC s cashcosts, which were $1.03 per pound in 1990, fell to 67 cents in 1994 and 53 cents in 1995. Our costs in 1995 were favorably affected by the very high molybdenum by-productcredits caused by high molybdenum prices.  In 1996, with the new low-cost SX/EWproduction and a molybdenum by-product credit based on a $4 molybdenum price, weexpect cash costs to be 56 cents per pound. <p>	SPCC increased its production 31% in 1995 over 1990 s production, to 279,000tons.  In 1996, production will increase another 16% due primarily to the new SX/EWproduction.  Silver and molybdenum production also has increased along with the highercopper production.<p>	Preble said that SPCC has made substantial expenditures to further protect theenvironment.  The Company spent $105 million for the construction of a sulfuric acidplant at the Ilo smelter, which was inaugurated January 19th of this year, and isconstructing a new tailings disposal system to be completed in late 1996.<p>	SPCC s board of directors approved plans to spend an additional $35 million toexpand the acid plant.  Expansion of the plant will further reduce sulfur dioxideemissions from the smelter and will improve the ambient air quality.  <p>	Preble told shareholders that SPCC s ore reserves also have increased.  <p>	 At the end of 1995 Southern Peru s proven and probable reserves totaled 1.3billion tons of sulfide reserves and 678 million tons of leachable reserves.  Additionally,989 million tons of mineralized material is now being evaluated.  With significant newreserves at both Cuajone and Toquepala, mine expansions are a real opportunity.<p>	 We are considering an increase in mine production of as much as 200,000 tonsper year, or about 70%,  Preble said.   Because the new reserves are contiguous to theexisting pits most of the infrastructure necessary for large mining operations already is inplace.  We have a detailed expansion study underway which should be completed laterthis year.<p>	 Major mine expansions,  Preble continued,  would require an expansion ofsmelting and refining capacity.  Our current smelter was built with 1950s technology andmodernized with the addition of a Teniente Converter and an acid plant.  We currentlyprocess 1.25 million tons of concentrate at the smelter. <p>	 Mine expansions would clearly dictate an increase in the size of our existingsmelting capacity,  Preble said.   A new smelter would use modern flash smeltingtechnology and would include a sulfur recapture rate at international standards.  We havenot decided whether such a plant would be built on a greenfield site or whether someportion of the existing plant would be retrofitted.  The cost of such a plant wouldcertainly exceed $500 million.  We will also consider an expansion of the Ilo refinery.<p>	Preble said that while the total cost of such an expansion would be significant,construction would be phased in over a period of years.  <p>	 We will need committed financing before we begin construction and we willlook to commercial banks, multilateral agencies and other lenders, including the publiccapital markets, to participate,  Preble said.<p>	Preble said that the investment climate in Peru is good.  Elections last year gavethe present administration a clear mandate to continue reforms the government hadbegun. The economy in Peru continued to improve in 1995.  GDP grew by 6.9% andinflation was 10.2%, the lowest in 23 years.<p>	SPCC is the largest mining company in Peru and operates two mines, a smelterand a refinery in the southern region of Peru, employing approximately 5,000 people.  </TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE WIDTH=550 BORDER=0><TR>	<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP COLSPAN=2>	<P><BR><BR>		<FONT COLOR="#633100"><FONT SIZE="-2">			FOR FURTHER INFORMATION:<BR>			Jerry W.

<A NAME= "mead">
<B>Mead --</B></A>The Mead plant, near Spokane, Washington, is an eight-potline facility capable of producing 200,000 tons of aluminum per year when operating at full capacity.  Much of Mead's production is trucked to the nearby Trentwood plant, primarily as molten metal.  Other Mead products include 1,000-pound ingots called sows, and shot used in the steel and magnesium industries.  A major modernization of Mead's carbon plant and anode-baking furnaces is due to be completed by year-end 1998. <P>

<A NAME= "tacoma">
<B>Tacoma --</B></A> With three potlines, the Tacoma, Washington, plant is capable of producing 73,000 tons of aluminum per year.  Tacoma produces two products -- 1,000-pound sows and high-grade coiled redraw rod used in high-tension electrical wire, insulated cable, and cable TV wiring.  Alumina comes from QAL.  While Kaiser's other primary aluminum plants employ pre-bake technology, Tacoma uses horizontal-stud Soderberg technology.  Tacoma's metal products operation is ISO 9002-certified.<P>

<A NAME= "ghana">
<B>Ghana --</B> </A> Located at Tema on the coast of Ghana in West Africa, Volta Aluminium Company Limited (Valco)  is owned by Kaiser Aluminum (holding a 90% interest) and Reynolds Metals Company (10%). The plant has a rated capacity of 200,000 tons per year, with Kaiser's share totaling 180,000 tons. Electric power is provided by the Volta River Authority's Akosombo hydroelectric dam, while alumina is supplied by Alpart and third parties.  Most of Valco's metal production is shipped to Europe; roughly 10% is supplied to Ghanaian customers.  About 99.3% of Valco's workforce is Ghanaian.  Valco attained ISO 9002 quality certification in 1994.<P>

<A NAME= "wales">
<B>Wales --</B></A>The owners of Anglesey Aluminium Limited in Wales -- Kaiser (49%) and RTZ Corporation (51%) -- supply alumina in proportion to their equity.  The resulting primary metal is sold back in the same proportions.  Alumina is supplied from Alpart or through swap arrangements, and Kaiser's share of metal production is sold to European customers.  The facility, which produces 130,000 tons per year, has attained ISO 9002 quality certification for its products and processes.

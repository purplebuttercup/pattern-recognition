<H2>Alumax Repurchases 1.46 Million Common Stock Shares</H2>
</CENTER>
<STRONG>Atlanta, Ga., November 20, 1997</STRONG> -- Alumax Inc. (NYSE:  AMX; Toronto:  AXI) today announced that it has recently repurchased a
total of 1.46 million shares of its outstanding common stock, or 2.6
percent of all Alumax shares outstanding on September 30, 1997, for
approximately $48 million, or an average of $32.87 per share.

<p>
Commenting on the stock repurchases, Allen Born, chairman and
chief executive officer, said:

<p>
``Alumax's share price, relative to the company's present
financial condition and results, makes the stock purchase program an
attractive investment opportunity and one that will help us achieve
our goal of improving both near-term and long-term stockholder
value.''

<p>
The recent share purchases were the first under a stock purchase
program authorizing the company to buy back up to 2.5 million shares
of its common stock.  The program authorizes Alumax to purchase the
shares from time to time, either on the open market or in negotiated
transactions, at price levels deemed desirable by the company.

<p>
Reflecting the recent stock repurchase activity, Alumax
currently has approximately 53.68 million common stock shares
outstanding.  As of September 30, 1997, the company had 55.12
million shares outstanding.

<p>
Alumax Inc. is a world leader in aluminum with assets of $3.4
billion and 1996 revenues of more than $3.1 billion.

<p>
The company produces and markets primary aluminum ingot, billet
and slab and is a major fabricator of value-added aluminum products
for the transportation, distributor, building and construction,
packaging and consumer durables markets.

<P>
<!-- <IMG SRC="./gifs/ovw01a.gif" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="140" BORDER="0"> -->
The company operates in all principal aspects of the aluminum business.  It mines bauxite, the major aluminum-bearing ore ... refines bauxite into alumina, the intermediate material ... and produces primary aluminum and fabricated aluminum products which it sells to customers directly or through distributors.

Kaiser manufactures aluminum products for the aircraft, aerospace, automotive, other transportation, beverage can, electronics, communications, consumer durables, marine, sporting goods, building and construction, and industrial markets -- to name a few.  In addition, the company licenses its technology and provides technical assistance to aluminum producers around the globe.
<P>
The company operates through business units and support organizations that act both independently and in concert.  Kaiser Aluminum International develops worldwide growth and investment opportunities, while Kaiser Aluminum Commodities oversees the alumina and primary aluminum businesses and -- through its Kaiser Commodities Marketing arm -- the marketing opportunities arising from their interrelationship.

In addition to alumina and primary aluminum, other businesses are flat-rolled products, the Kaiser Micromill<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> process, and engineered products, which includes extrusions, forgings, and castings.  Technological expertise is provided by several entities within Kaiser, the largest of which is the Center for Technology.

The company operates plants and major facilities at 32 locations in 12 states in the U.S. and eight other countries.  Altogether it employs about 9,500 people at domestic and majority-owned international operations.   It has assets of over $2 billion, and annual sales exceed $2 billion as well.

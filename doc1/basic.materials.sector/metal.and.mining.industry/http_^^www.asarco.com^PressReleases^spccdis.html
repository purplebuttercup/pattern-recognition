Preble, president of SouthernPeru Copper Corporation (SPCC), confirmed today that U.S. Federal District Judge JanisGraham Jack of Corpus Christi, Texas has entered an order dismissing a lawsuit by 698Peruvian plaintiffs filed against SPCC in August 1995.  The judge ruled that under U.S.and international law the subject matter of the lawsuit should be tried in Peruvian courts.  <p>	Preble said that in her order granting the defendants  motion to dismiss, JudgeJack noted that her exercise of jurisdiction would interfere with Peru s sovereign right tocontrol its own resources.  She also found baseless plaintiffs  arguments that the courts ofPeru are inadequate.  In addition, the judge cited various earlier U.S. court decisionsaffirming that Peru provides an adequate judicial forum.  </TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE WIDTH=550 BORDER=0><TR>	<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP COLSPAN=2>	<P><BR><BR>		<FONT COLOR="#633100"><FONT SIZE="-2">			FOR FURTHER INFORMATION:<BR>			Jerry W.

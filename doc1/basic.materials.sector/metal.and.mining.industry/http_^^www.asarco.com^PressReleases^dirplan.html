Effective October 25, 1995,the Board adopted a new Deferred Payment Plan through which outside directors willreceive a part of their compensation in Asarco common stock equivalents.<p>	At the Company's annual meeting in April, 1995, shareholders indicated that theywanted the Board to consider such a change in the compensation program in effect forAsarco Directors.  In making this change, the Asarco Board of Directors decided that thisnew form of stock-based compensation would more directly link Directors' compensationwith Company performance.<p>	Under the new Deferred Payment Plan, an amount equal to 75% of the annualretainer will be credited to a Deferred Payment account up to a maximum of ten years ofservice.  At least half of the amount under the Deferred Compensation Plan will beinvested in Asarco common stock equivalents.  Proceeds from this account will only beavailable following termination of Asarco Board service.<p>	ASARCO Incorporated, headquartered in New York City, is one of the world'sleading integrated producers of nonferrous metals, principally copper, lead, zinc, silver,molybdenum and gold.  Asarco also produces specialty chemicals and aggregates.<P><BR><BR><FONT COLOR="#1800FF"><FONT SIZE="2">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: Jerry W. Cooper (212) 510-1810 (212) 510-1835 (FAX) Donald M.

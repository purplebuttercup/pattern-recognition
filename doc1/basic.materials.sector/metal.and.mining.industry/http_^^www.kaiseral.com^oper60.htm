aiser Aluminum conducts research and development activities principally at four facilities
-- the Center for Technology (CFT) in Pleasanton, California; the Alumina Development Laboratory (ADL) at the Gramercy Louisiana, refinery; the Southfield Automotive Product Development Office located near Detroit, Michigan; and the Automated Systems Group in Spokane, Washington.

<P>Kaiser is actively engaged in efforts to license its technology and sell technical and managerial
assistance to other producers worldwide. Kaiser's technology has been installed in alumina
refineries, aluminum smelters and rolling mills located in the United States, Jamaica, Sweden,
Germany, Russia, India,  Australia, Korea, New Zealand, Ghana, United Arab Emirates, and the
United Kingdom. <P>

<B>Pleasanton --</B></A> Scientists and engineers at the Center for Technology (CFT) provide R&D support to  Kaiser using a full range of equipment -- including labs, testing facilities, computer modeling systems, and  large-scale pilot plant facilities.  CFT offers expertise in process technologies (casting, rolling, extruding,  forging, heat-treating, and finishing), product technologies directed at optimizing the material for its end  use (material evaluation testing, metallography, and analytical chemistry), and some customer  technologies (forming, welding, and can-making).  CFT has many successful developments to its credit  including new alloys for aircraft and automotive applications, process innovations, and the Kaiser  Micromill<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> process.  CFT also offers, on a selective basis, service to outside companies.

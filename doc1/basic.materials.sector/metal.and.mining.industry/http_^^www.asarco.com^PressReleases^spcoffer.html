Two seriesof the Labor Shares (S-1 and S-2) currently are listed and traded on the Bolsa de Valoresde Lima.  The exchange would be on the basis of one share of common stock for four S-1Labor Shares and one share of common stock for five S-2 Labor Shares.  The differencein exchange ratios reflects the interest of the S-1 Labor Shares in undistributed earningsof the Branch generated prior to the issuance of the S-2 Labor Shares.  The Labor Sharescurrently represent a 17.3% nonvoting interest in the Branch of SPCC which comprisessubstantially all of the operations of SPCC in Peru.  SPCC currently has an 82.7%interest in the Branch.<p>	Terms of the exchange require that a minimum of 50% of the outstanding LaborShares be tendered for the exchange to be effective.

Theexchange offer will expire at 5:00 PM EST on December 29, 1995, unless extended bySPCC.<p>	SPCC is currently owned by ASARCO Incorporated (NYSE:AR) (63%); asubsidiary of the Marmon Corporation (20.7%), and Phelps Dodge Overseas CapitalCorporation (16.3%).  The current shareholders will exchange their shares for new ClassA Common Stock of SPCC.<p>	Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. are acting as dealer managers to SPCC in the transaction.<p>	SPCC owns and operates two mines, a smelter and a refinery in the southernregion of Peru, employing approximately 5,100 people.  In 1994, SPCC produced fromits mines 267,800 short tons of copper, 3.0 million ounces of silver and 6.1 millionpounds of molybdenum.<p>	A registration statement relating to these securities has been declared effective bythe Securities and Exchange Commission.

This press release shall not constitute an offerto sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy such securities nor shall there be any sale ofthese securities in any State or country in which such offer, solicitation or sale would beunlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such Stateor country.</TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE WIDTH=550 BORDER=0><TR>	<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP COLSPAN=2>	<P><BR><BR>		<FONT COLOR="#633100"><FONT SIZE="-2">			FOR FURTHER INFORMATION:<BR>			Jerry W.

<H2>ALUMAX SELLS 23 PERCENT INTEREST 
IN MT. HOLLY ALUMINUM SMELTER FOR $89.3 MILLION</H2>
<P>
<STRONG>Norcross, Ga., January 30, 1996</STRONG> -- Alumax Inc. (NYSE: AMX;
Toronto: AXI)
announced today that its subsidiary, Alumax of South Carolina, Inc., has completed the sale to
Glencore Primary Aluminum Company, LLC, a subsidiary of Glencore International AG, of a 23
percent undivided interest in the 182,000-tonnes-per-year Mt. Holly primary aluminum smelter
in Goose Creek, South Carolina.
<P>
Alumax said Glencore also owns a 26.67 percent interest in the Mt. Holly smelter through its
subsidiary, Century Aluminum Company. Following the sale, Alumax of South Carolina will
retain a 50.33 percent interest in the plant and will remain the operator of the plant.
<P>
Alumax confirmed that it sold the additional interest in the Mt. Holly plant to Glencore for $89.3
million on January 26, 1996. Proceeds from the sale will be applied against the early retirement
of a $90.7 million promissory note payable to a Glencore subsidiary in May 1996. The company
said the additional interest it sold to Glencore represents approximately 41,700 tonnes of primary
aluminum capacity and related working capital.
<P>
Alumax also indicated that the sale represents about six percent of the 710,500 tonnes of annual
nameplate capacity that it controlled at year-end 1995. It noted that the transaction will generate
a pre-tax gain in excess of $75 million in the first quarter of 1996.
<P>
As a condition to the sale, the quantity of production from the Mt. Holly plant to which Glencore
is entitled under a tolling agreement that terminates in July 1996 has been reduced from 90,719
tonnes per year to 48,980 tonnes on an annualized basis.
<P>
Alumax is a world leader in aluminum with assets of more than $3.1 billion and annualized
revenues of approximately $2.9 billion.
<P>
The company produces and markets primary aluminum ingot, billet and slab and is a major
fabricator of value-added aluminum products for the building and construction, transportation,
containers and packaging and consumer durables industries.
<P>
Alumax employs 14,000 people in more than 100 plants and facilities in the United States,
Canada and Western Europe.

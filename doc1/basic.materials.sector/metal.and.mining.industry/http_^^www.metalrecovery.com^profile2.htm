<p align="left"><font size="2">In 1979, Honda imported the first
automobile into the U.S. with a galvanized body. By 1987 nearly
all of the cars produced in the world used galvanized metal to
extend the life of the vehicle. At the same time the use of
galvanized metal increased in other areas; appliances and
structural as an example. As the amount of galvanized scrap
increased the amount of black (non zinc containing) scrap
decreased.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">Through obsolescence, recycling,
and the creation of prompt scrap from automobile stamping and
other manufacturing operations, there is now a rapidly increasing
amount of galvanized scrap. The zinc coating on this galvanized
scrap causes pollution problems as well as decreased efficiency
when melted to produce new iron or steel. Two solutions exist to
this problem; either, use only black scrap, or, use mixed scraps
containing some quantity of galvanized which requires the
installation of costly equipment to minimize zinc pollution. As
the cost of waste treatment and disposal continues to rise a cost
effective method for changing galvanized to black scrap will
become increasingly more important to the iron and steel
industries.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">This problem was foreseen by the </font><a
href="aisi.htm"><font size="2">American Iron and Steel Institute</font></a><font
size="3"> </font><font size="2">during the late 1980&#146;s. The
AISI in conjunction with the </font><a href="doe.htm"><font
size="2">U.S. Department of Energy</font></a><font size="2">
(DOE) established funding for a research project to investigate
methods for the removal of zinc from galvanized scrap. The
recipient of this funding was </font><a href="argonne.htm"><font
size="2">Argonne National Laboratories</font></a><font size="2">
(ANL) and Metal Recovery Industries, Inc. Following some initial
research at ANL; MRI, starting in 1991, undertook the dezincing
of some 3,000 tonnes of scrap in the form of bales, clips, and
shred. The process developed produces a high quality black scrap
and high quality metallic zinc powder while generating no
hazardous wastes.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">From 1991 through 1995 work was
done to further refine the process and its economic viability. A
patent was applied for and is pending.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">In 1995, MRI was purchased by
Metal Recovery Technologies, Inc. (MRTI) which invested in a
pilot plant to verify laboratory and early trial results. In 1996
construction was begun on the pilot plant in East Chicago, IN. In
early 1997, with construction complete, this plant dezinced
another 1,500 tonnes of galvanized steel scrap and produced
approximately 5 tons of zinc powder. From the experience and
information gained from this trial run, MRTI has gained the
ability to expand the pilot plant to a 100,000 tpa production
facility and to properly design other follow on facilities.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">The environmental and economic
costs associated with the enormous increases in galvanized scrap
have generated a much greater degree of awareness and interest in
the MRI(US) dezincing technology.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">In February of 1997 MRTI received
from </font><a href="gm.htm"><font size="2">General Motors
Corporation</font></a><font size="2"> an invitation to propose a
250,000 tpa facility for the dezincing of scrap produced by GM
stamping plants in the Midwest. In April MRTI contracted with </font><a
href="ssoe.htm"><font size="2">SSOE</font></a><font size="2">
Engineering, the sixth largest Architectural and Engineering firm
in the U.S., for the design of such a plant and an audit of the
operating cost numbers formulated by MRTI. This work was
completed in August, 1997. SSOE&#146;s work confirmed to within
less than 5% the accuracy of the MRTI cost projections.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">The work initiated in 1991 was
funded by a $1.1 million grant from the DOE. Today a contract
exists with ANL for a grant of an additional $5.5 million. This
money is to be spent over a three year period on various
projects; including. the engineering and construction of a
commercial plant of at least 200,000 tpa capacity, and research
into improvements of the technology and its products.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">Funded by MRTI the </font><a
href="berkeley.htm"><font size="2">University of California,
Berkeley</font></a><font size="2"> is developing more efficient
methods for the recapture of zinc from the MRTI process. This
work, begun in 1996, is scheduled for completion in 1999 and will
help to decrease the operating cost of the MRTI process. This new
method may also have application in the recovery of zinc from
natural ores.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">Estimates provided by U.S.
Government sources place 1996 production of galvanized steel
sheet at 15.1 million tonnes. Estimates by automobile
manufacturers place the amount of scrap at 30% of purchased. It
is estimated that the dezincing of the approximate 5 million
tonnes of scrap would yield savings of:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="2">50 Trillion BTU&#146;s of
        energy to scrap melt shops.</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="2">$140 million in raw
        materials to U.S. iron and steel companies.</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="2">$100 million in foreign
        exchange deficit through the reduction in need for zinc
        imports.</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="2">Eliminate zinc from waste
        streams.</font></p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p align="left"><font size="2">The same Government estimates
place world wide production of galvanized sheet at 72 million
tonnes. Already MRI(US) is in serious discussion with steel
companies in Australia and Brazil and has fielded letters of
inquiry from Europe and Asia.</font></p>

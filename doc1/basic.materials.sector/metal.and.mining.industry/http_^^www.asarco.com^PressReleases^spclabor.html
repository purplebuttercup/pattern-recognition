Two seriesof the Labor Shares (S-1 and S-2) currently are listed and traded on the Lima StockExchange.  The proposed exchange would be on the basis of one share of common stockfor four S-1 Labor Shares and one share of common stock for five S-2 Labor Shares.  Thedifference in exchange ratios reflects the interest of the S-1 Labor Shares in undistributedearnings of the Branch generated prior to the issuance of the S-2 Labor Shares.  TheLabor Shares currently represent a 17.3% nonvoting interest in the Branch of SPCCwhich comprises substantially all of the operations of SPCC in Peru.  SPCC currentlyowns an 82.7% interest in the Branch.<p>	Terms of the exchange require that a minimum of 50% of the outstanding LaborShares be tendered for the exchange to be effective.  SPCC intends to apply for a listingof its Common Stock on both the Lima Stock Exchange and the New York StockExchange.<p>	SPCC is currently owned by ASARCO Incorporated (NYSE:AR) (63%); asubsidiary of The Marmon Corporation (20.7%), and Phelps Dodge Overseas CapitalCorporation (16.3%).  None of the current shareholders will be offering shares.<p>	Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. are acting as dealer managers to SPCC in the transaction.<p>	SPCC owns and operates two mines, a smelter and a refinery in the southernregion of Peru, employing approximately 5,400 people.  In 1994, SPCC produced fromits mines 267,800 short tons of copper, 3.0 million ounces of silver and 6.1 millionpounds of molybdenum.<p>	A registration statement relating to these securities has been filed with theSecurities and Exchange Commission but has not yet become effective.  These securitiesmay not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the registrationstatement becomes effective.  An application for the registration of these securities isexpected to be made in Peru.  This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or thesolicitation of an offer to buy such securities nor shall there be any sale of thesesecurities in any State or country in which such offer, solicitation or sale would beunlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such Stateor country.</TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE WIDTH=550 BORDER=0><TR>	<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP COLSPAN=2>	<P><BR><BR>		<FONT COLOR="#633100"><FONT SIZE="-2">			FOR FURTHER INFORMATION:<BR>			Jerry W.

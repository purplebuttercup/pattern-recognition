   Located near Price and Helper, Utah, the <B>Cyprus Plateau and Willow Creek Mines</B> are situated in the heart of Utah’s Castle Country where the remains of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals are found in close proximity to ancient rock art and artifacts from Native American cultures. <B>Cyprus Plateau</B> is a state-of-the-art underground mine that produces clean-burning, low-sulfur coal used to generate electric power and support a convenient, comfortable lifestyle for millions of Americans. 
<P>
Plateau is located near Price. The <B>Willow Creek Mine</B>, still under construction just north of Helper, provides a resource that will support continued mining operations after it is no longer feasible to mine at Plateau.

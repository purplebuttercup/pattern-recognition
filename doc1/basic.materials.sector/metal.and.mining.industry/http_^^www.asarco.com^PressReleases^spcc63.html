The purchase increases Asarco's interest inSPCC to 63% from 52.3%.  Total purchase cost was $116.4 million.<p>	As a result of the purchase, Asarco will fully consolidate the results of SPCC in itsfinancial statements.  Asarco had previously accounted for its investment in SPCC by theequity method.<p>	Commenting on the purchase, Richard de J. Osborne, Chairman of Asarco, said"SPCC is one of the world's leading producers of copper.  By increasing its interest inSPCC, Asarco is acquiring additional low cost copper production and ore reserves."<p>	SPCC operates two large open pit copper mines, a smelter and refinery all locatedin the southern part of Peru and produced 267,800 tons of copper from its own mines in1994.  SPCC reported sales of $701.7 million in 1994.<p>	SPCC is currently completing a $445 million modernization and expansionprogram which includes an SX-EW operation which will produce 40,000 tons of copperannually, the acquisition of the Ilo refinery completed in May 1994 and expenditures toupgrade operating and environmental facilities.  Additionally, SPCC has underway adrilling program to further delineate 1.3 billion tons of mineralized material grading anaverage of .7% copper adjacent to its two mines.  Current ore reserves total 588 milliontons of sulfide reserves with an average grade of .79% copper and .04% molybdenum andleachable reserves of 570 million tons with an average grade of .2% copper.<p>	ASARCO Incorporated, headquartered in New York City, is one of the world'sleading integrated producers of nonferrous metals, principally copper, lead, zinc andsilver.  Asarco also produces specialty chemicals, minerals and other industrial productsand provides environmental services.  Asarco had 1994 sales of $2.0 billion.</TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE WIDTH=550 BORDER=0><TR>	<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP COLSPAN=2>	<P><BR><BR>		<FONT COLOR="#633100"><FONT SIZE="-2">			FOR FURTHER INFORMATION:<BR>			Jerry W.

                <h3>Weyerhaeuser&#146;s Lower Earnings for First
                Quarter of 1997 Reflect Lower Pulp, Paper and
                Packaging Prices </h3>
                FEDERAL WAY, Wash., April 15, 1997 &#150;
                Weyerhaeuser today reported net earnings of $46
                million or 22 cents per common share for the
                first quarter of 1997 before a special after tax
                net charge of $25 million or 12 cents per common
                share, which the company announced in February.
                The 1997 first quarter net earnings of $21
                million or 10 cents per share compares with net
                earnings of $142 million, or 72 cents per common
                share for the same period of 1996. <p> Net sales
                in the first quarter of 1997 were $2.6 billion,
                equaling the amount reported for the first
                quarter of 1996. </p>
                <p> The after tax charge reflects the
                company&#146;s on-going efforts to narrow its
                portfolio and upgrade the quality of assets in
                its core businesses. The charge includes losses
                from the anticipated consolidation, closure or
                disposition of certain recycling facilities; from
                the completed, permanent closure of the
                corrugated medium machine at Longview, Wash.; and
                from the sale of Shemin Nurseries, a wholesale
                nursery business based in Danbury, Conn. These
                were somewhat offset by interest income from the
                favorable federal tax decision relating to
                casualty losses associated with the eruption of
                Mount St. Helens in 1980. </p>
                <p> Timberlands and Wood Products segment
                operating earnings for the first quarter of 1997
                were $171 million compared to $152 million for
                the same period of 1996 as a result of strong
                lumber prices in the United States. Earnings were
                higher than year-ago levels despite significantly
                lower oriented strand board prices in the United
                States and lower prices and log shipments to
                Japan caused by a slowdown in Japanese housing
                demand. </p>
                <p> Weyerhaeuser&#146;s Pulp, Paper and Packaging
                segment operating earnings were $6 million for
                the first quarter of 1997, before the effect of
                the special charge, compared to $162 million for
                the first quarter of 1996. Including the pretax
                charge of $49 million for closure of the medium
                machine and the consolidation of the recycling
                centers, the segment reported an operating loss
                of $43 million. </p>
                <p> Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company and
                Weyerhaeuser Financial Services earned $6 million
                in the quarter, compared to $10 million for the
                same period of last year. </p>
                <p> &quot;Our 1997 first quarter earnings were
                strongly depressed by lower prices for pulp,
                paper and packaging products compared to year-ago
                levels,&quot; said John W. Creighton, Jr.,
                president and chief executive officer of
                Weyerhaeuser Company. &quot;Pulp, paper and
                packaging markets are still difficult, but we are
                continuing to focus on our business improvement
                plans, which will strengthen our long-term
                competitive position.&quot; </p>

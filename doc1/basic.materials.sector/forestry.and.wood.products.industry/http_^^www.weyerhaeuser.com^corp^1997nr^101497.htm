                <h3>Weyerhaeuser Reports Third Quarter Earnings
                of $107 Million</h3>
                <p>FEDERAL WAY &#150; Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:
                WY) today reported third quarter net earnings
                before special items of $107 million, or 53 cents
                per common share, compared with $120 million, or
                60 cents per common share, for the same period
                last year. Net sales for the quarter ended
                September 28 were $2.8 billion compared with $2.9
                billion for the same quarter last year. </p>
                <p>During the quarter, Weyerhaeuser recorded a
                special after-tax net gain associated with the
                company&#146;s on-going efforts to narrow its
                focus and upgrade the quality of the assets of
                its core businesses. The net gain of $7 million,
                or 4 cents per common share, reflects a gain from
                the sale of a chemical business in Canada and
                charges associated with previously announced
                plans to close the plywood facility in
                Philadelphia, Mississippi. Including this gain,
                net earnings were $114 million, or 57 cents per
                common share. </p>
                <p>For the first nine months, Weyerhaeuser
                reported net earnings before special items of
                $243 million, or $1.22 per common share. During
                the same period last year, net earnings were $365
                million, or $1.84 per common share. Including
                special items, net earnings for the first nine
                months in 1997 were $244 million, or $1.23 per
                common share. </p>
                <p>Net sales during the first nine months were
                $8.3 billion, unchanged from the same period last
                year. </p>
                <p>&quot;During the third quarter we continued to
                see improvement in our Pulp, Paper and Packaging
                business,&quot; said John W. Creighton, Jr.,
                Weyerhaeuser president and chief executive
                officer. &quot;This improvement began late in the
                second quarter following the implementation of
                price increases in pulp, paper and newsprint.
                Global economic growth continues to drive
                increasing demand for pulp and paper products and
                improved market prices for most pulp, paper and
                packaging products. The performance of our
                Timberland and Wood Products businesses, however,
                has been hurt by a weak Japanese housing market.
                We believe the slowdown in the Japanese market
                could continue to affect our results into next
                year.&quot; </p>
                <p>Results by segment for the third quarter: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Timberlands and Wood Products: Operating
                        earnings, including the charge associated
                        with the plywood mill closure, were $172
                        million. Excluding the charge, the
                        segment reported operating earnings of
                        $182 million compared with $210 million
                        last year. In addition to slower lumber
                        and log sales in Japan, lower domestic
                        structural panel prices also affected the
                        segment's performance. </li>
                    <li>Pulp, Paper and Packaging: Operating
                        earnings were $97 million, including the
                        gain on the sale of Saskatoon Chemicals.
                        Excluding the gain, the segment reported
                        operating earnings of $76 million
                        compared with $79 million for the third
                        quarter last year. </li>
                    <li>Real Estate and related assets: Earnings
                        were $24 million compared with $5 million
                        last year. Strong real estate markets in
                        the areas served by the segment
                        contributed to this increase. </li>
                </ul>

                integrated forest product companies in the world.

                also is one of North America&#146;s largest

                <p><font size="2">Comments by John W. Creighton,
                Jr. contain statements concerning the
                company&#146;s future results and performance
                that are forward-looking statements within the
                meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
                Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject
                to uncertainties and risks that may cause actual
                results to differ materially from those
                projected. The company&#146;s businesses are
                cyclical in nature and are influenced by economic
                factors such as interest rates, housing starts,
                industrial production and GDP growth in the
                United States. The company&#146;s performance is
                also affected by its ability to successfully
                implement its business improvement plans and
                other internal performance objectives and its
                ability to achieve expected returns on numerous
                capital projects. Many of the company&#146;s
                products are used in the manufacture of other
                products and face the threat of customers
                substituting other materials. The company is also
                a large exporter and is affected both by changes
                in economic activity in Europe and Asia,
                particularly by changes in GDP and housing starts
                in Japan, our largest export market, and by
                changes in currency exchange rates. The
                company&#146;s timberlands and manufacturing
                facilities are subject to extensive forestry,
                land use and environmental regulations that
                change frequently. The company&#146;s major
                businesses are also affected by government
                policies regarding the management of public lands
                in the United States and Canada and by
                international trade restrictions. In addition to
                unanticipated changes in government regulation
                and policy, natural disasters and unusual weather
                conditions can damage the company&#146;s forests
                and operations and impact supply conditions for
                the company&#146;s products. </font></p>

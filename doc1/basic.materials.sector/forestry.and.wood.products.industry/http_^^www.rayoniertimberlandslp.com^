<blockquote><p>Rayonier Timberlands, L.P. grows and sells timber in the U.S.
on 778,000 acres in the Southeast 
and on 369,000 acres in the Northwest. Rayonier Inc., the Special General
Partner, owns 74.7 
percent of the 20 million outstanding Class A Units of Rayonier Timberlands,
L.P. The balance 
is publicly traded on the NYSE.</p></center>

<p>Rayonier Forest Resources Company, the managing general partner
of Rayonier Timberlands, 
L.P. (NYSE:LOG), cautions unitholders that the market value of Class
A Units should be decreasing substantially as the end of the Initial Term approaches. Class
A unitholders are generally 
entitled to 95 percent of Partnership earnings and cash flows through
December 31, 2000. This 
percentage drops to 4 percent after the year 2000. Accordingly, Class
A unitholders' share of 
Partnership distributions, which are based on cash flows, will be significantly
less beginning in 
2001. </p></center>
<P>
When the Initial Term ends on December 31,
2000, the Primary Account of the Partnership will be closed but the unitholders will not be entitled to have their Partnership capital accounts redeemed until the Partnership formally ends in the year 2035. After December 31, 2000, the interest of Class A unitholders in the Partnership's future
revenues, expenses and cash flows will decrease from 95 percent to 4 percent.  On a <I>pro
forma</I> basis, using 1996 results as an example, cash allocable per Class A Unit would decline
from $5.69 to approximately 24 cents. In addition, there will be substantial Secondary Account
debt that will mature on January 1, 2001. This debt (incurred to fund long-term investment in
such areas as reforestation and silvicultural activities including accrued interest) is expected to
exceed $350 million, more than three times 1996's net operating cash flow. In
accordance with the Partnership Agreement, all Secondary Account debt must be repaid before
any distribution of Partnership cash flow resumes. As a result, it is expected that the market price
of Class A Units should be decreasing substantially as December 31, 2000 approaches.

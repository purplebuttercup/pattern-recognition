        <h2><strong><a name="A2">Introduction:</a> </strong></h2>
        <p>It is an honor for me to be able to participate in the First Global Conference on Paper
        and the Environment. Before beginning the discussion of industrial forestry, I would like
        to provide a brief background on Weyerhaeuser Company. </p>
        <p>Weyerhaeuser Company is one of the leading forest products companies in the United
        States and Canada, with 39,000 employees and annual sales of $9.3 billion. We are the
        world's largest producer of softwood lumber, and one of the largest North American
        exporters of pulp and paper products. Our 14 primary pulp and paper facilities in the U.
        S. and Canada represent 6.3 million tons of annual capacity. We handle over 1.8 million
        tons per year of recycled fiber, which makes us the 5th largest recycler in the United
        States. </p>
        <p>Since our founding in Tacoma, Washington in 1900, the timberland resource that supports
        our operations has grown to 2.3 million hectares of privately owned timberland in the
        United States, plus 6.6 million hectares managed under long term license in three
        provinces in western Canada. These lands can accurately be described as industrial
        forests, since they are all managed to provide a sustainable flow of commercial timber to
        a wide range of manufacturing facilities and industrial customers. </p>
        <h2><strong><a name="A3">World Demand for Wood:</a> </strong></h2>
        <p>To understand the role of industrial forests in world forest products trade, it is
        helpful to begin with an understanding of expected demand for wood and wood fiber.
        Population growth, and the desire for an improved standard of living in both developed and
        developing countries, is driving a steadily increasing demand for both wood and paper
        products. World population is forecast to increase from 5.3 billion people today to 10
        billion people by the middle of the next century, an annual growth rate of 1.6 percent per
        year. However, demand for industrial roundwood for paper and forest products is growing at
        approximately 2 percent per year, and will reach 2 billion cubic meters per year by the
        end of this decade, according to a recent report by the U.N. Food and Agricultural
        Organization (FAO, 1991). </p>
        <p>Historically, most of the wood that society requires has come from natural forests, but
        it is now becoming apparent that we cannot rely on continued access to undeveloped natural
        forests to meet future industrial wood requirements. The remaining undeveloped natural
        forests, while extensive in total, are being rapidly depleted in some countries,
        particularly in the tropics. The rate of tropical deforestation, due principally to
        urbanization and clearing for agriculture, was estimated at 16.9 million hectares per year
        at the time of the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janiero (FAO, 1992). </p>
        <p>Much of the world's remaining natural forest is the subject of relentless attention by
        international environmental groups, by concerned citizens and consumers, and by government
        policy makers. This concern is focused on the role that these forests play in maintaining
        global climate and biological diversity, their importance as the last remaining habitats
        for many threatened or endangered species, and the fact that they provide the opportunity
        for an increasingly urban population to experience the undisturbed natural forest
        environment before it is forever modified by development. </p>
        <p>Within the next ten to twenty years most of the developed countries, and many of the
        developing nations, will make long term decisions about the amount of their remaining
        natural forests that will be reserved from development, or managed primarily to achieve
        resource objectives other than commercial timber production. An example from the Pacific
        Northwest in the United States illustrates this trend. Less than 20 percent of the land on
        nineteen publicly owned National Forests in Washington and Oregon are considered suitable
        and available for timber production, yet this percentage is likely to be further reduced
        in the near future in order to reserve more habitat for threatened and endangered species,
        and because the majority of the public wants to protect more of the remaining old growth
        timber on federal lands from harvest. </p>
        <p>Consequently, we can expect that an increasing percentage the wood required for lumber,
        structural panels, and pulp and paper products will come from industrial forests, and
        other private and public forests, that are recognized by society as being managed for
        commercial timber production, thereby reducing the need to continue developing additional
        natural forest area for that purpose. </p>
        <p>Fortunately, in many parts of the world we now have over fifty years of experience in
        demonstrating what industrial forests can produce under intensive forest management.
        Intensively managed forests are providing wood for our industry in locations as diverse as
        the United States, Canada, Europe, Sweden, Finland, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, and
        Chile. <br>
        </p>
        <h2><strong><a name="A4">Industrial Forestry in the United States:</a> </strong></h2>
        <p>To illustrate the potential for intensive forest management, I will describe our own
        company's experience. One of the major milestones in industrial forestry in the United
        States occurred on June 12, 1941, when we dedicated our Clemons Tree Farm in Washington
        state to long-term sustained yield management. This event was made possible by
        establishing a reliable forest fire protection system, and by initiating early research on
        forest regeneration methods. Prior to that time, private forest land that had been
        harvested was commonly converted to agricultural uses, or left idle to regenerate
        naturally. </p>
        <p>Since 1941, the industry-sponsored Tree Farm system in the United States has grown to
        over 38.5 million hectares, owned and managed by more than 35 companies and over 70
        thousand nonindustrial private landowners. Industrial forests now represent 15 percent of
        the commercial forest lands in the United States, and lead all other ownership categories
        in annual per hectare growth and productivity. </p>
        <p>As mentioned earlier, since 1941 Weyerhaeuser Company's private forests in the United
        States have increased to 2.3 million hectares, with an additional 6.6 million hectares in
        British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan managed under long term licenses with those
        three Canadian provinces. </p>
        <p>All of these lands are managed using combinations of proven intensive forestry
        practices. In all cases, rapid regeneration following harvest is assured, normally by
        planting genetically improved seedlings within one year. The seedlings that we plant are
        produced in one of our eight western or southern nurseries. Our nursery system provides us
        with the ability to produce many different tree species adapted to our own lands, as well
        as seedlings for sale to other forest landowners. </p>
        <p>Competing vegetation is controlled where necessary through careful application of
        selective herbicides. Many stands are precommercially thinned by age twelve to maintain
        optimum spacing for vigorous growth. </p>
        <p>Intermediate-aged stands on favorable terrain are scheduled for commercial thinning. In
        our southern loblolly pine forests, commercial thinning to produce pulping fiber and
        improve spacing normally takes place by age 15, followed by a second thinning by age 25.
        Douglas fir stands in the Northwest can be thinned to produce small sawlogs as early as
        age 30. </p>
        <p>Fertilization is an important silvicultural treatment on lands where our soil surveys
        show nutrient deficiencies. Nitrogen, applied in the form of urea, and phosphorous are the
        most common elements required to enhance growth on our U. S. forest lands, and may be
        applied up to three or four times during one rotation. </p>
        <p>Long term growth and yield is further enhanced by our extensive research and
        operational experience in genetic tree improvement. Essentially all of the trees that we
        plant come from seed produced in our own seed orchards, and represent one generation of
        tree improvement. An increasing percentage of our southern seedlings are grown from seed
        produced in second generation seed orchards. </p>
        <p>To provide perspective on the scale at which these silvicultural practices are applied,
        in 1992 alone, we planted over 40 thousand hectares with 44 million seedlings,
        precommercially thinned over 17 thousand hectares, and applied nutrients to almost 68
        thousand hectares of both planted and natural stands. Over 1.3 million hectares of our
        forests in the U. S. are planted stands that have received combinations of these
        treatments. </p>
        <p>An example from the Douglas fir region, in the Pacific Northwest, illustrates the
        leverage that this series of silvilcultural treatments can have on per-hectare growth and
        yield. In our experience in the Douglas fir region, planting alone increases productivity
        by 90 percent over an unmanaged, naturally regenerated stand. First generation tree
        improvement adds at least 10 percent, and thinning and fertilization approximately 70
        percent. The combined effect of this series of silvicultural treatments, over a
        forty-to-fifty year rotation, is a 180 percent increase in the growth and yield that could
        be expected from an unmanaged stand. On high-site Douglas fir timberland, this represents
        an additional 525 cubic meters of wood per hectare at time of harvest. <br>
        </p>
        <h2><strong><a name="A5">Application to Industrial Forestry Worldwide:</a> </strong></h2>
        <p>The silvicultural practices illustrated in this example are not unique to Weyerhaeuser
        Company, nor are they unique to the United States. Similar proven practices are being
        implemented on industrial forests in other countries, on many nonindustrial private lands,
        and on many public forests as well. Recent data indicates that there are now approximately
        128 million hectares of planted forests being managed in at least 24 countries (Brooks,
        1993). </p>
        <p>The growth rates achieved using intensive silvicultural practices are consistently
        greater than what is attainable under unmanaged conditions, and are particularly
        impressive in the southern hemisphere, where Brazil, Chile, and New Zealand set the pace
        for the rest of the world in mean annual increment achieved in planted forests. </p>
        <p>There is little doubt that the intensive silviculture that I have described can
        significantly increase per hectare growth and yield during the first rotation. There are
        legitimate scientific questions about whether growth rates of this magnitude can be
        sustained over multiple rotations. Research to date in temperate region forests indicates
        that these growth and yield levels can be sustained, provided that soil nutrient balance
        and organic matter are maintained. However, continuing research and monitoring will be
        necessary over a long period of time to verify the actual growth that can be achieved in
        subsequent rotations. </p>
        <h2><strong><a name="A6">Sustainable Forestry:</a> </strong></h2>
        <p>While we have demonstrated that intensively managed forests are successful in growing
        wood, we have not yet convinced the public that industrial forests are sustainable, or
        that they are being managed to provide adequate protection for the other resources that
        people expect from forests. Questions are being raised about whether intensively managed
        forests can maintain long-term forest health, provide favorable wildlife habitat, and
        maintain water quality and stream habitats needed to protect the fisheries resource. Some
        customers are beginning to ask for assurances that the wood and paper products they
        require are, in fact, being produced from sustainable forests. </p>
        <p>Recent reports and governmental policy actions have highlighted public expectations for
        sustainable development, and the importance of sustainable forests to the health of
        ecosystems, social well-being, and economic development. Perhaps best known is the
        Bruntland Commission report (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987) but,
        more recently, the Forestry Principles adopted at the 1992 UNCED Conference in Rio de
        Janiero (UNCED, 1992), have made it clear that society expects that forests will be
        managed to sustain a wider array of forest resources than wood production alone. </p>
        <p>Recognition of this fact is causing foresters to re-think how they apply foresty
        prescriptions to both large forested landscapes and to site-specific situations. Most
        foresters of my generation learned to think about silviculture in terms of stand-level
        prescriptions, without considering the implications for the broader landscape, or
        ecosystem. Today in the United States, there is a considerable amount of effort underway
        to define the ecosystem principles appropriate for federal lands, and how private forest
        lands can contribute to ecosystem management. A similar effort is occurring on provincial
        forest lands in Canada. </p>
        <p>In Washington state, several of our forest managers and research scientists
        participated in a recent workshop sponsored by the University of Washington, College of
        Forest Resources, that identified the following ecological objectives for industrial
        forest lands (University of Washington, 1993). <ul>
          <li>Protection of riparian areas and wetlands areas and wetlands </li>
          <li>Provision of habitat for early and mid-successional species </li>
          <li>Assisting public land managers in meeting their responsibilities for late-successional
            ecosystems </li>
          <li>Maintaining site productivity<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong><a name="A7">Forest Practices in the United States:</a> </strong></h2>
        <p>The ecological objectives now being identifed for industrial forest lands are the
        latest development in the recent history of private forest practice in the United States.
        During the past twenty years, forest management on private lands has become increasingly
        subject to requirements to protect and enhance water quality, wildlife and fisheries
        habitat, and other nontimber resources. </p>
        <p>The Pacific Coast states of Washington, Oregon, and California have comprehensive
        forest practices laws and regulations that specify timber harvesting and road construction
        standards, regeneration requirements, and protection measures for water quality, riparian
        zones, and a variety of wildlife habitat characteristics. </p>
        <p>Forestry operations in other parts of the United States are conducted according to
        voluntary best management practices developed cooperatively by the forest industry and
        state forestry agencies. The end-result goals are the same; protection of public resources
        and the basic environmental attributes of managed forests, while maintaining the ability
        and incentive for private forest landowners to produce a continuous supply of timber for
        future generations. </p>
        <p>In recognition of the changing public expectations for industrial forest stewardship,
        the American Paper Institute, now known as the American Forest and Paper Association, in
        1992 adopted Forest Management Principles that established nationwide performance goals
        for industrial forest lands (American Paper Institute, 1992). Member companies are pledged
        to implement these Principles, which include: <ul>
          <li>Practicing a land stewardship ethic which integrates the growing, nurturing, and
            harvesting of trees for useful products with the conservation of soil, air, and water
            quality, wildlife and fish habitat, and aesthetics. </li>
          <li>Managing forests to maintain and improve their health and productivity. </li>
          <li>Promoting successful reforestation, thus preventing deforestation or the loss of forest
            productivity. </li>
          <li>Managing forests in biologically, geologically, and historically significant areas in a
            manner that takes into account their special qualities. </li>
          <li>Supporting research and employing state-of-the-art scientific and sivicultural knowledge
            to enhance forest resources. </li>
          <li>Protecting forests from wildfire, insects, diseases, and other damaging agents. </li>
          <li>Providing a safe and healthy work environment for industry employees, and continuing to
            improve management of our operations to better protect public health and safety. </li>
          <li>Strengthening educational and communications efforts to improve understanding of the
            wise use of forest resources and to respond to public concerns.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Industrial forestry performance goals such as these will become normal expected
        practice over the next few years, certainly in the developed countries, and likely in the
        developing countries for forests that are managed by international forest products
        companies. Rather than resist this expectation, we should view such performance goals as
        an opportunity to demonstrate that industrial forestry is an environmentally preferred
        land use where a broad range of forest resource goals can be satisfied and sustained. </p>
        <h2><strong><a name="A8">Summary:</a> </strong></h2>
        <p>In summary, increasing population and growing demand for forest products are placing an
        unacceptable burden on the world's remaining natural forests. In the next few years, large
        areas of the remaining primary forests will be reserved from commercial use in order to
        protect biological diversity and endangered species habitats, as well as to ameliorate
        global climate change. </p>
        <p>Future paper and forest products requirements will be increasingly provided by
        industrial forests, and other intensively managed private and public forests. Worldwide
        experience with intensive forest management has shown that per hectare growth and yield
        can be significantly increased. </p>
        <p>Managers of industrial forests are now being challenged to demonstrate that intensive
        forestry is sustainable, and compatible with broader ecosystem management goals. During
        this decade foresters around the world are learning to integrate intensive silvicultural
        practices with protection of wildlife habitats and other environmental goals. </p>
        <p>As we approach the next century, we are entering a period of tremendous opportunity for
        industrial forest landowners. People around the world require the wood products that
        industrial forests provide. Intensive management of private forest land will enable
        society to preserve the best of our remaining natural forests for noncommercial uses. It
        is truly a time when the public will both understand and realize the benefits of
        farsighted and long-term industrial forest stewardship. </p>

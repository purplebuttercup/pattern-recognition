                <h2><strong><a name="A2">Introduction:</a> </strong></h2>
                <p>I am pleased to be here to join with leaders
                of the pulp and paper industry from Europe and
                North America to talk about paper and the
                environment. With much debate swirling around the
                industry these days, I began to wonder when the
                act of cutting down a tree first became
                controversial. It seems like the debate has been
                going on forever. </p>
                <p>Well, I can now report that it has, almost.
                According to historians, public expression of
                concern about the impact of tree cutting was
                first recorded about 4,700 years ago, in
                Mesopotamia. I found some comfort in the
                knowledge that the controversy has been going for
                centuries, likely ever since humans began using
                wood and wood fiber. </p>
                <p>Still, so far as we know, Mesopotamia didn't
                have mass communications, CNN, talk shows or the
                Internet. There is no question that over the past
                20 years, we've witnessed unprecedented concern,
                scrutiny and sometimes direct assaults-on
                industrial forestry. </p>
                <p>Both in North America and abroad, advocacy
                groups have raised concerns about clearcutting
                and the need to preserve old growth. Major
                campaigns have been mounted to protect
                endangered-species habitat. Groups have promoted
                consumer boycotts of paper products. Too
                frequently, the forest industry is portrayed as a
                destructive despoiler of the environment. </p>
                <p>In this atmosphere, we must ask: What will the
                future look like for industrial forestry? In
                brief, I would forecast a rough patch of road
                near term, but a more favorable outlook in the
                future. </p>
                <p>If you look at demand for wood fiber, there is
                reason to be positive. There is a growing
                population and increasing global demand for
                fiber. Our products make a significant
                contribution to the quality of life. We are in a
                business manufacturing products that are
                renewable, recyclable and sustainable. In fact,
                paper and wood producers have the potential to be
                models of sustainability. But, of course, it is
                not quite that easy. </p>
                <p>To achieve that future, we need to respond to
                genuine societal concern about the environmental
                impact of industrial forestry. These concerns
                have been expressed in varying degrees at both
                the ballot box of electoral politics and in the
                marketplace of consumer preference. Part of the
                solution, I believe, resides in a new
                &quot;social contract&quot; with the public for
                industrial forestry. </p>
                <h2><strong><a name="A3">Exploring a social
                contract for industrial forestry</a> </strong></h2>
                <p>During my remarks this afternoon, I would like
                to explore with you what this social contract for
                industrial forestry is about; why we need it, and
                the benefits it can deliver. </p>
                <p>Although I will elaborate in a few minutes
                about what a social contract involves, let me
                provide a shorthand version. It sum, it means
                that the public accepts tree harvesting and
                forest management as socially valuable, based on
                the utility of our products and overall benefits
                we create for people-be they customers,
                employees, communities or investors. </p>
                <p>But we can take the social contract even
                further than that. It can help us defuse the
                controversy surrounding forestry and the use of
                paper products. It can help us turn down the
                volume of public debate and increase public
                support. </p>
                <p>The pulp and paper industry can be recognized
                as responsible stewards of the forest and
                managers of the environment. We all want to work
                in a business that is respected by the public and
                valued by customers. We want employees to feel
                pride in the work they do and in the products we
                make. And we want a secure and prosperous future
                for our business enterprises. It will take more
                than just technology or capital to get there. It
                will take a renewed social contract for
                industrial forestry and better alignment with
                public values. </p>
                <p>The idea of a social contract itself is hardly
                radical. We each live in countries and
                communities knit together by a complex web of
                social contracts. For example, if I see a
                &quot;Metro&quot; sign on the streets of Paris, I
                know I can walk down the stairs, purchase a
                ticket, and within a few minutes board a subway
                that will take me to another part of the city. </p>
                <p>As businesspeople, citizens and individuals,
                we are party to scores of voluntary agreements,
                some written, most simply understood. When these
                agreements are in dispute, we have mechanisms
                like courts and governments to enforce them. When
                it comes to environmental issues, we face both
                conventional courts of law and the informal court
                of public opinion. </p>
                <p>Let's look at the notion of a &quot;social
                contract&quot; as it relates to industrial
                forestry. It has many dimensions, but three
                important ones: </p>
                <p><b>1. The social contract implies that our
                ability to manage forests and harvest
                timber-whether on private or public lands-depends
                of the consent of the public.</b> </p>
                <p>Dr. Clark Binkley, the respected dean of the
                Faculty of Forestry at the University of British
                Columbia, recently published a paper that
                observed: &quot;cutting down a tree creates
                ethical obligations: an obligation to sustain the
                forest from which the tree was cut; an obligation
                to use the wood wisely and efficiently.&quot;
                Embracing these obligations and publicly
                articulating them, Dr. Binkley concluded, might
                help move us a step closer to greater public
                support for forestry. </p>
                <p><b>2. The social contract reflects the
                acceptance of obligations between successive
                generations.</b> </p>
                <p>This captures the notion of what we now call
                &quot;sustainability,&quot; defined in the
                Brundtland report as: &quot;development that
                meets the needs of the present, without
                compromising the ability of future generations to
                meet their own needs.&quot; </p>
                <p><b>3. The social contract, like any
                traditional contract, describes rights and
                benefits in return for obligations.</b> </p>
                <p>Contracts define accountability and increase
                certainty that all parties will perform to
                expectations. </p>
                <p>A social contract does not mean greater and
                unjustified intrusion by government into the
                marketplace. As we will discuss in a few moments,
                the success of a new social contract will very
                much depend on the workings of an innovative,
                dynamic market system. </p>
                <h2><strong><a name="A4">That explains what a
                social contract is. But why do we need it?</a> </strong></h2>
                <p>All of the elements described above-public
                consent, sustainability, rights in exchange for
                obligations-speak to the notion of stewardship.
                Indeed, it is precisely on the question of
                stewardship that the assault on industrial
                forestry is based. It is this ground that
                industry must now strive to regain. </p>
                <p>When I started working for the company about
                20 years ago, the prevailing social contract was
                a much simpler arrangement. Forest companies
                harvested trees and replanted seedlings,
                manufactured a host of useful products, and
                provided well-paying employment opportunities.
                Resource scarcity and environmental impacts were
                not yet a practical daily concern for forest
                companies. </p>
                <p>Today, public-opinion research tells us that
                public misgiving about the impact of commercial
                forestry is widespread. There is a new awareness
                of the finite nature of Earth's resources and
                concern about overharvesting and wasteful
                consumption. Public anxiety is heightened by
                mounting population pressures, incidents of
                environmental degradation, and ominous
                predictions about global warming and climate
                change. </p>
                <p>As well, commercial forestry now faces an
                experienced, well-financed, permanent opposition.
                Environmental activism is international and
                institutionalized. Advocacy groups are active on
                a wide range of interests and issues. </p>
                <p>In the forest sector, this has included
                campaigns targeting everything from mill
                effluents to harvesting practices. These groups
                are media-savvy, with an enviable talent for
                generating news coverage. Many are active around
                the globe, using computer networks to share
                information and implement coordinated strategies.
                </p>
                <p>Environmental groups raise many questions
                about industrial forestry-with the public,
                regulators, customers, consumers, even investors.
                We are sometimes reluctant to concede how much
                positive change has occurred in forest practices
                as a direct result of activism by
                environmentalists. Their efforts have helped us
                become a better industry. </p>
                <p>But all of this debate has raised doubt in the
                public mind about the long-term future of the
                forest industry. To restore public confidence, it
                is not reasonable to tell people that attacks on
                industrial forestry are wrong-headed or
                scientifically unfounded. Indeed, some of their
                assertions have turned out to be true. So today,
                we need to listen, learn and match industry
                performance with public expectations to
                demonstrate the compatibility of industrial
                forestry with responsible stewardship. </p>
                <p>How can we do a better job connecting with a
                wide, diverse public that includes everyone from
                employees to local communities to overseas
                customers, consumers and legislators thousands of
                kilometers away? </p>
                <p>Consider the new global connections implicit
                in freer world trade. Factor in the expansion of
                personal interaction and individual choice
                becoming possible through the Internet. With so
                many boundaries disappearing, how can we possibly
                forge a new social contract around industrial
                forestry that embraces all producers,
                manufacturers, customers, consumers and
                stakeholders around the world? </p>
                <p>I see a solution to this dilemma in the
                workings of the free market. In fact, against the
                backdrop of the challenge we face, the importance
                of the free market to the new social contract for
                industrial forestry becomes apparent and -- dare
                I say -- natural. </p>
                <p>Adam Smith's metaphor of the &quot;invisible
                hand&quot; to describe the workings of the free
                market system offers insight into
                environmentalism as well as into economics. In
                showing that the economy functions
                organically-like an ecosystem-Smith described how
                the connection of millions of voluntary choices
                created something much greater than the sum of
                its parts. </p>
                <p>Consider the pencil-a remnant of low
                technology in the digital age. Yet understanding
                the pencil is a simple way to understand the
                cooperative functioning of the market. </p>
                <p>Where did the wood come from? The metal rim?
                The rubber? The paint? The lead? Just reflect for
                a moment how much voluntary human interaction was
                essential to make the pencil available-affordable
                and within easy purchasing distance anywhere in
                the world. That is the &quot;invisible hand&quot;
                of the free market. Literally millions of tiny
                miracles of competition and cooperation that
                together form a free-market system-one that
                mimics in some ways Mother Nature's own intricate
                ecosystem. </p>
                <p>Apply that same insight to a more complex end
                product ...say a monthly magazine for readers in
                Western Europe. How is it created? Trees are
                harvested in Canada using North American and
                Scandinavian technology. The logs are
                manufactured into lumber using Canadian
                technology. Chip byproducts are converted to
                kraft pulp using resource inputs from around
                Canada and technology drawn from around the
                world. </p>
                <p>The market pulp arrives in Germany and is
                converted to lightweight coated paper using
                Scandinavian technology. The paper is printed on
                a high-speed press-likely German in origin.
                Articles printed on the pages reflect the
                intellectual capital of writers and graphic
                designers from a dozen or more countries. The
                publication includes advertising for perhaps 100
                different products and businesses. The result, a
                monthly magazine is-just like the pencil-the
                product of countless contracts and transactions
                of cooperation and competition. The product of a
                free market. </p>
                <h2><strong><a name="A5">Forging a viable social
                contract</a> </strong></h2>
                <p>Once the democratic aspect of the free market
                is understood-we vote with our purchasing
                decisions as well as with ballots-then forging a
                viable social contract that has room for
                industrial forestry will make sense to the
                public. </p>
                <p>Once human economic activity is recognized as
                natural -and not intrinsically hostile to
                nature-there is a basis for a meeting of the
                minds. There can be a healthy interrelationship
                between good business and sustainable
                development. The social contract can be global,
                and it can cross generations. </p>
                <p>In the United States and Canada where
                Weyerhaeuser is managing forestland, it takes
                anywhere from 35 to over 100 years between
                replanting and harvesting a new stand of trees.
                Market conditions a generation or a lifetime into
                the future are not only hard to predict-they are
                impossible to predict. But the importance of
                forests to the planet, and to meeting human
                needs, is not in question. The need to
                continuously renew the forest is a given. </p>
                <p>That takes us back to industrial forestry. The
                notion of stewardship is very much a part of our
                social contract. The concept of forest
                stewardship in Weyerhaeuser is fundamental to our
                ethics and values, and it shapes how we operate
                our businesses. <br>
                In North America, Weyerhaeuser is one of a small
                number of &quot;multi-generational&quot; forest
                companies. The company celebrates its 100 <sup>th
                </sup>anniversary in the year 2000. I am the
                fifth generation of my family who has enjoyed the
                privilege of sharing in the company's management
                and growth. Along the way, the company has been
                recognized for pioneering efforts in what is now
                called sustainable forestry. </p>
                <p>My great-great grandfather, Frederick
                Weyerhaeuser, one of the founders of the company,
                had a view of managing the forests that
                encompassed future generations. On the company's
                founding in 1900, he is reported to have said:
                &quot;this is not for us, nor for our children,
                but for our grandchildren.&quot; </p>
                <p>Still today, our commitment to forest renewal
                and to research is deep and long-standing. While
                it supports what I am referring to today as our
                &quot;social contract,&quot; I would make the
                case that it also reflects a sound, long-term
                business strategy. Good business judgment equates
                to honoring the social contract, and vice versa. </p>
                <p>In the early 1940s, the company pioneered the
                American Tree Farm system of sustained-yield
                forest management. On some of our private land,
                we are now harvesting our third forest crop. </p>
                <p>Our commitment to significant investment into
                forestry research also began nearly 50 years ago.
                It initially focused on regeneration of native
                species, soil productivity, optimizing timber
                yield per hectare, seedling nurseries, and tree
                improvement. </p>
                <p>In the mid 1960s, we were &quot;early
                adopters&quot; of then-emerging computer
                technology to model and implement High Yield
                Forestry to maximize long-term forest
                productivity on our private lands. During the
                same period, we were among the first companies to
                bring scientists and technicians specializing in
                wildlife and fisheries biology and, later,
                aquatic ecology, forest hydrology and
                environmental forestry-into our forest-management
                process. </p>
                <p>Today, our scientists and forest managers
                continue to pioneer new dimensions of resource
                management, including watershed analyses and
                habitat conservation planning started in the US
                Pacific Northwest and now being introduced
                elsewhere. </p>
                <p>We are applying geographic information systems
                (GIS)-satellite technology and computer
                modeling-to modifying the aesthetics of forest
                harvesting and management in many operating
                areas. </p>
                <p>We also engage in cooperative research with
                universities and public agencies. And we have
                been project partners and financial supporters of
                a number of environmental organizations. </p>
                <p>All of these activities speak to stewardship
                as a key element in the social contract for
                industrial forestry as practiced by Weyerhaeuser.
                The social contract is not words so much as it is
                action and performance. </p>
                <h2><strong><a name="A6">What must the
                practitioners of industrial forestry do today to
                renew the social contract?</a> </strong></h2>
                <p>We must start by continuing to meet human
                needs for wood and fiber. This also involves
                meeting community needs for sustainable jobs.
                Tomorrow morning, Weyerhaeuser's technical
                director, Dean Decrease, will describe how we
                integrate the needs of key stakeholders to
                optimize our production processes using our
                &quot;minimum-impact manufacturing&quot; (MIM)
                strategy. </p>
                <p>Industry must demonstrate its commitment to
                stewardship by considering the other users and
                interests -whether we operate on tree farms on
                private land or on public forestland. </p>
                <p>We must bring to industrial forestry a
                commitment to reinvest in the land-to pass to
                future generations a forest as productive and
                &quot;green&quot; today as it was when we became
                its stewards. </p>
                <p>We must be willing to embrace voluntary
                self-regulation in managing the environmental
                impacts of our activities. We can show commitment
                to the public interest by being proactive-not
                simply complying with the regulatory
                &quot;stick&quot; of government. </p>
                <p>As an industry, we must publicly support
                defined forestry principles that focus not only
                on wood production, but also accommodate other
                values, including soil, water, fish and wildlife
                habitat, culturally unique areas, and plant and
                species diversity. Within some reasonable
                standard, we must accommodate less tangible
                considerations, such as biodiversity goals. </p>
                <p>In regions of Canada where we operate, we are
                beginning to work more closely with Aboriginal
                peoples, who have inhabited some of these areas
                for 4,000 years or more. We are learning from
                them about forest values implicit in their
                culture, tradition and experience. </p>
                <p>Finally, in all of these areas, we must
                demonstrate a commitment to continuous
                improvement in our environmental and our economic
                performance. We recognize the need to act on
                ever-better information, not on narrow ideology
                or simplistic, short-term interest. </p>
                <h2><strong><a name="A8">The role of government</a>
                </strong></h2>
                <p>As custodians of the public interest,
                governments also have a role in the new social
                contract. </p>
                <p>Governments must protect a defined land base
                for intensive commercial forestry. In the case of
                Weyerhaeuser, this will involve private lands in
                the United States and public forestland in Canada
                zoned specifically for more intensive industrial
                forestry where timber production is the primary
                use. Secure, long-term access to timber is
                essential to adequate reinvestment. </p>
                <p>Commercial forestry makes a major contribution
                to Canada's economy. Because so much original
                forest remains in Canada, it has a unique
                opportunity for a policy of wise set-asides to
                reflect representative ecosystems. If decision
                making is based on reliable science and common
                sense, Canada's role as a major producer of
                forest products for the world need not be
                compromised. </p>
                <p>Like industry, governments must also strive to
                be innovative. Both elected representatives and
                regulatory agencies must accept the onus to use
                sound science as the basis for regulation and to
                demonstrate the benefit achieved. Traditional
                command-and-control regulation should be replaced
                with incentive-based standards and defined
                resource targets. That way, companies are free to
                be innovative in determining how environmental
                goals are best achieved. The focus shifts from
                enforcement to results. Environmental leadership
                can be rewarded. </p>
                <p>Although many governments are burdened with
                deficits and accumulated debt, they must resist
                the temptation to impose taxes that deny business
                a fair return on investment. Just as industry has
                a responsibility not to degrade the health of the
                environment and to respect the rights of future
                generations, governments have an obligation not
                to degrade the health of the economy by imposing
                unsustainable levels of regulation and taxation. </p>
                <p>Governments have a related obligation not to
                reduce our ability to meet the challenge of
                intense global competition, so long as companies
                meet environmental performance goals. </p>
                <p>Achieving these goals underscores the need for
                a global consensus about forestry standards.
                Ideally, we should strive for international
                agreements to set a fair, level playing field for
                all participants. An international certification
                process for industrial forestry standards could
                be a God-send or it could be an unmitigated
                disaster-depending on its content. But with a
                shrinking globe, with economic, trade and
                information boundaries fading way, I am convinced
                that we must take the high ground by working
                toward an international consensus on standards
                that make sense. The less-attractive options are
                to wait for others to define standards for us or
                to deal with different standards in multiple
                jurisdictions. </p>
                <p>The ISO approach to defining international
                standards makes a lot of sense to us. ISO was
                created in 1947 to establish consistent standards
                that would allow trade barriers to be removed,
                creating more opportunities for free trade. </p>
                <p>The new ISO 14001 guidelines, which define
                broad environmental management standards for
                manufacturing industries, are a case in point. We
                believe an ISO approach could also help us
                define, implement and certify international
                standards for sustainable forestry practices. </p>
                <h2><strong><a name="A9">What will a new social
                contract ask of environmentalists?</a> </strong></h2>
                <p>In part, it asks green activists to build
                bridges and seek common ground with the other
                side-the same demand it makes of industry. I see
                this as a highly inclusive process, embracing
                most green activist groups. </p>
                <p>To negotiate this contract, however, we need
                to marginalize the extreme elements on both
                sides. Environmental &quot;fundamentalists&quot;
                who perceive humans as somehow hostile to nature
                and outside the ecosystem want to eliminate
                industrial forestry and consumption of paper
                products. They hold little sway with the public.
                Likewise, companies who behave irresponsibly
                toward nature are held in low esteem. </p>
                <p>Instead, sincere environmentalists are
                beginning to work with industry in defining
                shared, reasonable goals and pragmatic solutions.
                We have worked hard in recent years to reach out
                and to build bridges to these stakeholders, both
                in Europe and in North America. </p>
                <p>In sum, the new social contract needed to make
                sustainable commercial forestry secure has room
                neither for environmental fundamentalists, nor
                for irresponsible corporations, nor for runaway
                government regulation. </p>
                <p>Today, the notion of sustainable environment
                means a fundamentally changed operating climate
                for industrial forestry. We must find new ways to
                deal with business impacts internal and external
                to the marketplace. I am convinced that we can
                not only sustain the forest, but we can use our
                intelligence and apply continuous learning to
                build forest wealth over time. </p>
                <p>As in nature, the free market sees and blends
                competition and cooperation. Both companies and
                species have become extinct as a result of
                factors completely beyond and outside the purview
                of human control or influence. Change is a
                constant. </p>
                <p>In the media age, public scrutiny of
                industrial forestry is a fact of life. If our
                forest practices are responsible, if industry
                performs to defined standards, if our processes
                are open, then public support can be increased.
                Most citizens are not extremists and will welcome
                a sincere, positive initiative from industry to
                secure sustainable environmental quality and a
                prosperous forest sector. </p>
                <p>Maintaining access to timber and fiber-whether
                on public or private land-depends on a renewed
                social contract that will restore public
                acceptance and appreciation for industrial
                forestry and the products made from it. </p>
                <h2><strong><a name="A10">Continuous improvement
                and stewardship</a> </strong></h2>
                <p>That new social contract has many aspects, but
                none more important than stewardship. It includes
                continuous improvement in how we do business and
                better understanding of the environmental impacts
                of our business. And it requires renewed public
                trust in our ability to understand and
                effectively manage the impacts of industrial
                forestry. </p>
                <p>If we can effectively articulate the
                dimensions of that new social contract, we shall
                not only find our own &quot;green&quot; niche in
                the global economy. We will also achieve
                prosperity and profitability by manufacturing
                products needed by people. At the same time, we
                will continue to make a positive contribution to
                the planet's conservation as the home for both
                humans and countless other species. </p>
                <p>As business leaders in the pulp and paper
                industry, we must take the initiative on many
                fronts: with our peers, with government, with the
                public and the media, with communities, with
                consumers, with investors, and with potential
                environmental partners. We must seek, as the
                final, binding seal of our new social contract,
                an ethic of openness, honesty, fairness and
                balance in public dialogue around forestry
                issues. </p>
                <p>In many respects, we have been continuously
                renegotiating and rewriting the social contract
                around forestry for decades-even centuries. As
                history shows, probably for as long as people
                have been cutting down trees. </p>
                <p>Wood fiber has been used over millennia to
                meet fundamental human needs. With reason as our
                guide and hopefulness our companion, I believe we
                can seek a renewed and just social contract for
                industrial forestry. And we can achieve a
                sustainable supply of fiber and a secure and
                prosperous future for pulp and paper business
                enterprises. </p>

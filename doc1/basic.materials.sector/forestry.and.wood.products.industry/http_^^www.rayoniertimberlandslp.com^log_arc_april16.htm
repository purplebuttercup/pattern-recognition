<h2>Earnings, Distributions And Other 
News</h2>

<H3>RAYONIER TIMBERLANDS, L.P. ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS</H3>
<B>STAMFORD,CONNECTICUT, April 16, 1996</B> - Rayonier Forest Resources Company (RFR), the managing
general partner of Rayonier Timberlands, L.P. (NYSE:LOG), said first quarter 1996 Partnership
earnings declined 6 percent from last year∆s first quarter primarily as a result of reduced prices
caused by slackening demand from the pulp and paper industry.
<P>
Partnership income was $34.5 million or $1.78 per Class A Unit, down $2.3 million, or 6 cents per Class A Unit, from first
quarter 1995 results. Operating cash flow allocable to each Class A Unit was $1.83, down 9
cents per Class A Unit. Sales were $46.8 million, down $1.7 million from last year∆s first
quarter.
<P>
In the Northwest U.S., unfavorable market conditions throughout 1995 caused many
customers to defer harvesting until late 1995 and into 1996. The combined stumpage and
delivered log volume was 31 percent above the 1995 harvest. However, this increase was
partially offset by a 6 percent decline in prices from the prior year. As a result, sales increased
$5.9 million from the first quarter of 1995 to $31.6 million and operating income increased $4.6
million to $25.9 million.
<P>
In the Southeast U.S., first quarter sales declined $7.6 million from the
first quarter of 1995 to $15.2 million and operating income declined $6.2 million to $12.0 million,
reflecting lower volume and prices. Overall harvest volume declined 19 percent and prices
declined 16 percent from the 1995 first quarter. The declines were due to softening demand from
the pulp and paper industry as mills took market downtime. 
<P>
"We want to remind Unitholders of our statement in our annual report that we do not expect full year Partnership earnings or cash
flow from operations to be as strong as in the prior year," said Ronald M. Gross, president. This
is primarily because of continuing weakness in pulp and paper and Asian log export markets.
Distributions for the remainder of the year and the first quarter of 1997 are expected to total less
than $6.17, which was the Partnership∆s cash flow per Class A Unit in 1995. 
<P>
Rayonier Forest Resources continues to caution unitholders that when the Initial Term ends on December 31,
2000, the Primary Account of the Partnership will be closed but there will not be any redemption
of the partners∆ capital accounts. The interest of Class A unitholders in the Partnership∆s future
revenues, expenses and cash flows will then decrease from 95 percent to 4 percent.  On a <I>pro
forma</I> basis, using 1995 results as an example, cash allocable per Class A Unit would decline
from $6.17 to approximately 22 cents. In addition, there will be substantial Secondary Account
debt that will mature on January 1, 2001. This debt (incurred to fund long-term investment in
such areas as reforestation and silvicultural activities including accrued interest) is expected to
amount to over $350 million, more than three times 1995∆s net operating cash flow. In
accordance with the Partnership Agreement, all Secondary Account debt must be repaid before
any distribution of Partnership cash flow resumes. As a result, it is expected that the market price
of Class A Units should begin to decline substantially sometime prior to December 31, 2000.

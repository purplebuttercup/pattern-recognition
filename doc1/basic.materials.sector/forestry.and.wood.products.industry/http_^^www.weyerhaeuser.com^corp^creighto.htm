                sustainability through continuous improvement </strong></h1>
                <p>Remarks by President John W. Creighton, Jr. <br>
                To: Second Global Conference on Paper and the
                Environment <br>
                Frankfurt <br>
                26 April 1994 </p>
                <h2><strong><a name="A1">Introduction:</a> </strong></h2>
                <p>Good Morning. It's a pleasure to be in
                Frankfurt to discuss the future of this industry.
                Coincidentally, Weyerhaeuser's roots are here in
                Germany. Frederick Weyerhaeuser, our founder, was
                born 160 years ago in Niedersaulheim. When he
                came to the United States as a young man, he
                brought with him the hallmarks of his culture:
                integrity, optimism, hard work and a sense of
                responsibility. Those traits helped him start a
                company that has become the world's largest
                producer of market pulp and softwood lumber. If
                you include both our U.S. lands and our long-term
                leaseholdings in Canada, Weyerhaeuser is
                responsible for forestlands that are together
                almost the size of Australia. </p>
                <p>During the past century, my company has
                contributed to our industry's success in meeting
                the global demand for wood and paper products.
                We've done that by providing a sustainable supply
                of wood from increasingly productive forests. As
                we approach the 21st century, we face the
                challenge of reducing our environmental impact
                and maintaining healthy, diverse forest
                ecosystems. </p>
                <p>We're ready for that challenge. Like cost
                reduction and quality improvement, improved
                environmental performance is a critical element
                of superior manufacturing. It requires our every
                resource, including new technology, meaningful
                measurements and Total Quality management. But it
                involves more than the technology of growing
                trees. We must also manage forests for their
                spiritual, aesthetic and cultural values-as well
                as ecological and economic values. </p>
                <p>This is especially true since what's right for
                on forest may not be right for all. The world's
                forests each feature very different geographies,
                climates, ages, species mixes and potential uses.
                For instance, one forest classification system
                divides Canada into 90 distinct forest types in a
                dozen ecozones. So no single management practice
                could possibly fit every situation. What's needed
                is a balance of forest uses and management
                techniques. </p>
                <p>I believe that young forests-like those owned
                by Weyerhaeuser-can be managed with emphasis on
                sustainable wood production while remaining
                sensitive to other forest values. High
                productivity from such forests helps relieve the
                pressure on other forestlands, which can then
                emphasize values like wilderness, old-growth
                reserves and recreation. The exact balance will
                vary from forest to forest but, in total, will
                create productive, sustainable forests that
                together serve a variety of ecological, social
                and economic needs. </p>
                <p>I believe those healthy, sustainable forests
                can be attained through three critical steps: </p>
                <p>1. <b>Defining a clear vision and values for
                the future. </b>Achieving healthy, sustainable
                forests requires a clear view of what that really
                means. Weyerhaeuser's vision is clarified by a
                set of environmental values, which I'll tell you
                more about shortly. <br>
                2. <b>Identifying and taking concrete steps
                toward our vision. </b>We can make our vision a
                reality through continuous improvement that
                considers whole ecosystems and diverse
                perspectives. Success won't come quickly or
                easily, but we are making measurable progress
                with meaningful intermediate steps. <br>
                3. <b>Tracking and communicating our progress. </b>Increasingly,
                our success depends both on making measurable
                environmental progress and on demonstrating and
                sharing that progress. </p>
                <p>I'd like to discuss each of these three steps,
                with some examples that indicate how Weyerhaeuser
                has already begun. <br>
                </p>
                <h2><strong><a name="A2">First: the need for a
                clear vision and values.</a> </strong></h2>
                <p>We must know where we are going. Since our
                journey impacts the forest resources of future
                generations, long-term perspectives is important.
                Fortunately, people in the forest products
                industry are used to thinking in 50-and 100-year
                increments fitting the life cycles of trees. We
                are one of the few industries experienced with
                truly long-term planning. And Weyerhaeuser
                already has a template for defining that
                environmentally sound future: minimum-impact
                manufacturing. That approach begins with a broad
                perspective that uses careful planning, tracking
                and continuous improvement to direct change
                throughout our operations. </p>
                <p>From that perspective, what does our vision of
                &quot;healthy, sustainable forests&quot; mean? At
                Weyerhaeuser, its meaning is created by our
                stewardship values. We've committed to managing
                our forest for wood production, and also to
                protecting or enhancing: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>soil productivity. </li>
                    <li>water quality. </li>
                    <li>fish and wildlife habitat. </li>
                    <li>biologically or culturally unique areas,
                        and </li>
                    <li>plant and animal species diversity.<br>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>I could discuss each at length, but for now
                I'll just talk about one. Our commitment to fish
                habitat means: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>creating buffers along rivers and
                        wetlands; </li>
                    <li>leaving downed trees in the water to
                        create riffles, pools and hiding places; </li>
                    <li>maintaining the light and temperature
                        levels fish-and their food
                        sources-prefer; </li>
                    <li>preventing siltation through better road
                        building and maintenance; and </li>
                    <li>taking part in cooperative research and
                        policy making to improve our
                        understanding of fish habitats and human
                        impacts upon it. <br>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition, though we manage our company's
                private forestlands to produce wood, our vision
                for sustainable forestry also says that we
                cooperate with public agencies and resource
                groups to help them manage public forestlands for
                other purposes. Those may include wilderness,
                old-growth reserves, protection of threatened or
                endangered species, or other forest values. </p>
                <p>One example is my company's participation in
                Canada's model forest program. Diverse partners
                have united to ensure sustainable ecological,
                social and economic benefits from 10 model
                forests across the country. The Prince Albert
                model forest in Saskatchewan, for example, is
                315,000 hectares jointly managed by
                representatives of: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>several First Nations, </li>
                    <li>provincial and national government, </li>
                    <li>the Canadian Institute of Forestry, as
                        well as </li>
                    <li>Weyerhaeuser Canada.<br>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>This cooperative project is helping us all
                learn more about maintaining healthy forest
                ecosystems that can deliver a variety of
                sustainable benefits. </p>
                <p>Other forest users are also key to another
                Weyerhaeuser value: our pledge to actively listen
                and respond to public expectations and to
                communicate consistently. That's important,
                because both our vision and how we achieve it
                must withstand scrutiny from the various
                perspectives of our: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>scientists, </li>
                    <li>shareholders, </li>
                    <li>customers, </li>
                    <li>communities, and </li>
                    <li>critics.<br>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>These diverse audiences force us to ask
                continuously, &quot;Are we doing enough?&quot;
                That's why our values include continuously
                improving the environmental quality and economic
                value of our forests. Both contribute to the
                environmentally sound vision and values I just
                described. </p>
                <p>Having a vision and values is not enough,
                however. We must have action. <br>
                </p>
                <h2><strong><a name="A3">That brings us to the
                second stage of our journey: identifying concrete
                steps that take us where we want to go</strong>.</a>
                </h2>
                <p>Before discussing what that means for
                forestry, let me give an example from our pulp
                mills that may be familiar. Weyerhaeuser's vision
                for minimum-impact manufacturing includes
                eliminating effluents. We've mapped a path for
                achieving that, but we can't get there all at
                once. Intermediate steps require reducing the
                toxicity of our current effluents. This,
                elemental chlorine-free pulp bleaching, or ECF,
                moves us in the right direction because it
                reduces the formation of toxic chlorinated
                organics. Totally chlorine-free bleaching, or
                TFC, is another stepping stone. Neither ECF nor
                TCF is the goal itself. Our vision guides us in
                identifying and choosing between these
                intermediates steps. </p>
                <p>For forestry, identifying intermediate steps
                depends on finding or developing ways to measure
                our progress. Such measurements help determine
                whether we are, in fact, moving toward our goals.
                They also provide needed ecological and economic
                criteria for assessing our options. </p>
                <p>Over the years we've developed good
                measurement criteria for the growth rates and
                biological needs of our trees. We also have many
                solid measures of forest soil, water flows, fish
                habitat and wildlife. We've only just begun
                collecting data on bio-diversity, aesthetics, or
                cumulative human impact on a forest ecosystem.
                Over time, that emerging knowledge will both
                direct our actions and help quantify improvement.
                Today, however, those critical measurements and
                guidelines are still a challenge for some issues.
                </p>
                <p>Take clearcutting, for example.
                &quot;Clearcutting&quot; is the common name for
                even-aged management-removing most or all of the
                trees in an area to make full use of their wood
                and to prepare the site for replanting. Changes
                in Weyerhaeuser harvest planning in recent years
                have generally resulted in: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>reduced clearcut size, </li>
                    <li>boundaries matched to the landscape, </li>
                    <li>greater consideration of adjacent areas, </li>
                    <li>decreased erosion, and </li>
                    <li>wider buffers for waterways and public
                        roads.<br>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>So our clearcutting practices are already
                being modified to respond to today's ecological
                understanding. </p>
                <p>Before we can determine how clearcutting will
                evolve in the future, we must fully consider the
                ecological and economic--as well as
                aesthetic--tradeoffs.We use even-aged management
                for sound silvicultural and practical reasons.
                Some tree species just can't grow to their full
                potential in less than the full sunlight that
                follows a clearcut harvest or a wildfire. </p>
                <p>Or a volcanic explosion like the one that
                occurred at Mount St. Helens in Washington state
                in 1980. Sixty thousand hectares of forestland
                were flattened, scorched and covered with ash.
                The destruction far outweighed the impact of even
                the largest clearcuts, and some experts predicted
                that the area would take decades, even centuries
                to recover. </p>
                <p>Today, after less than 15 years, trees we
                planted on Weyerhaeuser land after the eruption
                stand 10 meters high. Elk have returned by the
                hundreds. Salmon reproduction rates equal or
                surpass those on adjoining property. Where nature
                was unassisted, the area still largely looks like
                a blast zone. But on managed Weyerhaeuser land,
                the new forest thrives. The Mount St. Helens
                eruption gave us an unprecedented laboratory to
                test our forests' recuperative powers. </p>
                <p>In examining clearcutting, shall we disregard
                that experience and the science on which we base
                our practices? If so, what should we base actions
                on? Our foresters and public policy makers must
                jointly answer these questions, using valid
                criteria to determine where clearcutting is or is
                not appropriate. Similar criteria are needed to
                determine how much old growth is sufficient, when
                a wildlife population is viable, or how
                biodiversity is defined. </p>
                <p>I'm hopeful that the process and criteria for
                making such decisions may evolve from work by
                groups such as the International Standards
                Organization. Weyerhaeuser is also working this
                issue through the Canadian Pulp &amp; Paper
                Association and the American Forest &amp; Paper
                Association. </p>
                <p>Until better processes and criteria are
                developed, however, we must proceed-using the
                best information at hand-to make meaningful and
                measurable improvements toward our vision. At
                Weyerhaeuser, for instance, regional forest
                councils set objectives for the soil, water, fish
                and wildlife habitat, aesthetics and biodiversity
                of our forests. These objectives are based both
                on broad goals, such as protecting wetlands or
                other special biotopes, and on more specific
                priorities addressing individual species and
                community issues. Our forest councils then define
                changes in our practices to achieve those
                objectives. </p>
                <p>For example, we're taking fish and wildlife
                habitat management a big step further by
                developing our first multispecies habitat plan
                for 40,000 hectares of our forestland in
                southwest Washington state. </p>
                <p>Last year, we voluntarily initiated the first
                phase of this approach, known as watershed
                analysis. The trial took place on 26,000 hectares
                in another part of Washington-the Tolt River
                watershed. It was a cooperative effort by
                landowners, government agencies, native people
                and environmental groups, each recognizing the
                importance of protecting water quality. As
                pressures on the earth's fresh-water resources
                mount, better management of all forested
                watersheds becomes essential. Further, we must
                concern ourselves with not only individual
                impacts on watersheds, but with the cumulative
                effects of all human activities. </p>
                <p>To understand those cumulative effects, a team
                of scientists thoroughly studied the Tolt
                watershed's slopes and soils, water flows,
                erosion potential and fish habitat. The team then
                defined special management prescriptions tailored
                to the unique conditions in each area. These
                prescriptions-such as increasing the riparian
                buffer zones along certain streams-are in
                addition to the normal forest practice rules. </p>
                <p>We've begun implementing these prescriptions
                and monitoring to test their effectiveness. That
                makes this a dynamic, adaptive process that will
                change with our understanding. In the next phase,
                satellite images and on-site surveys will help us
                address wildlife and biodiversity. By December
                1994, Weyerhaeuser scientists will have analyzed
                10 to 12 additional watersheds, with a goal of
                completing five more each year. </p>
                <p>Another example addresses scenic beauty, which
                is especially important in my home state. We
                asked the public about harvest aesthetics, and
                consulted a well-known landscape architecture
                firm to identify ways to better manage them. Then
                we began training our foresters to consider those
                perspectives when planning future harvests. <br>
                Over time, we expect efforts like these to result
                in what my Swedish colleagues call a
                &quot;richer&quot; forest. <br>
                </p>
                <h2><strong><a name="A4">That brings me to the
                third step in achieving our vision: Tracking and
                communicating our progress.</a> </strong></h2>
                <p>The information we obtain in the previous step
                will be invaluable for assuring both ourselves
                and the public that we are, in fact, making
                steady progress. This industry has a shaky record
                in either announcing successes or admitting
                difficulties. We must overcome that tendency, and
                explain what we are doing and why. </p>
                <p>We've done a good job of that in terms of
                trees. I can tell you, for instance, that
                Weyerhaeuser planted over 40 million seedlings
                last year, or that we harvest no more than 2 to 3
                percent of our forests each year, thus ensuring a
                sustainable supply. I can also tell you that over
                400 species of animals, birds and fish live in
                our western U.S. forests-but I can't yet say how
                that count may change over time, or whether it
                implies appropriate biodiversity. We still must
                develop consistent, meaningful methods for
                tracking and communicating the improvements we
                make. </p>
                <p>We also realize we must speak a language our
                audiences can understand. As scientists and
                business people, our habit has been to
                communicate primarily with facts, figures and
                technical terms. Rarely have those been well
                understood or well received. Our various
                audiences are often more interested in the
                spiritual, cultural and aesthetic values of
                forests than in growth rates. We must better
                consider those values. </p>
                <p>Nor do our individual customers and
                communities represent the only opportunities for
                improved communication. The task before us is far
                larger than a single company or country. As an
                industry, we must support joint research. Share
                our environmental discoveries. And learn from
                others' successes and mistakes. </p>
                <p>Finally, we must recognize that our vision
                will evolve in response to new discoveries,
                changed values or breakthrough technology. Our
                challenge is to accept that uncertainty and
                strive for our vision in a continuous improvement
                cycle. </p>
                <h2><strong><a name="Conclusion">Conclusion </a></strong></h2>
                <p>To summarize, the parts of that cycle again
                are: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>first, defining a clear vision and values
                        for the future; </li>
                    <li>second, identifying and taking concrete
                        steps to achieve that vision; and </li>
                    <li>third, tracking and communicating our
                        progress.<br>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Together, these three steps guide improvement
                based on specific scientific knowledge while
                ensuring decisions that fit a holistic view of
                our forest ecosystems and the broad perspective
                of our long-term goals. </p>
                <p>This is not, by the way, &quot;business as
                usual.&quot; We have examined our forest
                practices in response to public concern and are
                making needed changes. I'm convinced that the
                three-step approach I've described will result in
                significant, measurable improvement. It has
                already allowed companies worldwide to make
                significant improvements toward superior
                manufacturing. If you'd like to stop by the
                Weyerhaeuser exhibit in the conference display
                area, we'd be happy to tell you more about the
                environmental improvements our company is already
                making with this approach. </p>
                <p>In closing, I'd like to leave you with this
                thought: However our environmental vision takes
                shape in the coming years, and however our
                industry may change, we know today that we have a
                long way to go. The complexity of our multiple
                geographies, habitats, ownerships, publics and
                political environments ensures that. But with a
                vision firmly in place, and with a commitment to
                measurable action and continuous improvement,
                together we can reach that future. </p>

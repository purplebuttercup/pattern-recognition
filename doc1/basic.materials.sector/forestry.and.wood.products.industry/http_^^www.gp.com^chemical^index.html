The right chemistry exists between the Georgia-Pacific Chemical team
and the people who matter -- our valued employees, customers,
suppliers and neighbors. We form strong customer partnerships, work
closely with suppliers, and offer employees excellent career
opportunities. We've established a rapport, a sense of cooperation
and mutual commitment that builds confidence and trust and the kind
of organization that communities are proud to call "neighbor."

 the environmental values of the forest while providing for
 economical timber growth and harvest. Plum Creek will be
 responsive to public expectations for water and air quality, and
 for wildlife and ecological diversity. Plum Creek practices
 forestry on sound scientific and economic principles, and is
 dedicated to the future growth, productivity, diversity and health
 of its forests.<BR><BR>

<H2>Environmental Principles -  Resources</H2>

We conduct forest management activities according to the following environmental
 principles:
<UL>
<LI><B>Sustainable Forest Management</B> - Manage our forests in a sustainable,
      socially responsible, economic manner.<P>

<LI><B>Ecological and Structural Diversity</B> - Enhance ecological and structural
      diversity where feasible and prudent by using a variety of silvicultural
      techniques, by retaining a diversity of vegetation and leaving trees of various
      sizes and species, snags, culls, and other organic debris.<P>

<LI><B>Water Quality</B> - Meet, and where appropriate exceed, state and federal
      standards to protect water quality and fisheries by using Best Management
      Practices for all forest management activities, including the retention of buffers
      along streams and wetlands.<P>
      
<LI><B>Air Quality</B> - Protect air quality by burning only when required by law for
      hazard abatement or when burning is an appropriate silvicultural technique to
      improve forest conditions or improve aesthetics in visually sensitive areas.<P>
      
<LI><B>Reforestation</B> - Ensure future forest productivity and sustained forest growth
      by using the most ecologically and economically appropriate reforestation
      methods. Ensure that reforestation has occurred in all harvest areas - within
      two years in the westside forests of our Cascade Region and within five years
      in the Rocky Mountain Region and the east slopes of the Cascade Region.<P>
      
<LI><B>Soil Conservation</B> - Maintain soil and site productivity by minimizing soil
      disturbance during harvest, and by recycling harvest residue for nutrient
      preservation.<P>
<LI><B>Wildlife and Habitat Management</B> - Protect and enhance wildlife species
      and habitat areas through judicious control of road access, harvest
      management and cooperation with state and federal wildlife agencies.<P>
<LI><B>Visual Quality</B> - Recognize and manage for aesthetic values near communities
      and major travel corridors by using appropriate design standards, harvest
      methods and tree retention.<P>
<LI><B>Adjacent Land Management</B> - Cooperate with neighboring landowners in
      addressing and minimizing potential cumulative effects of resource management
      activities.<P>
<LI> <B>Research and Development </B>- Learn, experiment, innovate and respond to
      changing scientific knowledge, public concerns and economic conditions to
      optimize both financial and environmental performance.<P>
<LI>  <B>Auditing</B>- Conduct regular audits to ensure that we meet or exceed the  commitments made through our environmental principles.
</UL>

<H2>Environmental Principles -Manufacturing</H2>
We conduct manufacturing activities according to the following environmental
 principles:

<UL><LI><B>Environmental Management</B> - Strive to be an industry leader in managing
      our facilities in an environmentally, socially and economically responsible
      manner that meets the needs of our customers, employees, surrounding
      communities and owners.<P>
      
      <LI><B>Air, Water and Soil Quality</B> - Meet, and where appropriate exceed, state
      and federal regulations to protect air, water and soil quality. Establish
      measurable standards and conduct regular internal and third-party audits to
      ensure that we meet or exceed our criteria.<P>

      <LI><B>Safe Workplace</B> - Provide a safe and healthful work environment free of
      recognized hazards.<P>

     <LI> <B>Wood Fiber Recovery </B>- Identify economically viable means to enhance
      wood fiber recovery. Reduce, reuse or recycle wood fiber to generate minimal
      waste. Dispose of any waste generated in a safe and environmentally
      responsible manner.<P>

      <LI><B>Good Neighbor </B>- Recognize and manage our impact in the neighboring
      communities to ensure public health and safety by controlling noise, minimizing
      or preventing pollution, and maintaining aesthetic values.<P>

      <LI><B>Minimize Use of Hazardous Materials</B> - Minimize the use of hazardous
      materials in the manufacturing process where possible. Identify and substitute
      non-hazardous materials in processes where an economical and functional
      substitute exists.<P>

      <LI><B>Minimize Energy Consumption</B> - Continually examine and adopt means to
      maximize energy efficiency and provide internally generated energy where
      economically feasible.<P>

      <LI><B>Research and Development </B>- Learn, experiment, innovate and respond to
      changing scientific knowledge, public concerns and economic conditions to
      optimize both financial and environmental performance.<P>

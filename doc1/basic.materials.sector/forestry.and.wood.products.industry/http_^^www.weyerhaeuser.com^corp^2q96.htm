                <h1 align="left"><strong>Weyerhaeuser's 1996<br>
                2nd-quarter earnings </strong></h1>
                <p>Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings of $103.2
                million, or 52 cents per common share for the
                second quarter of 1996 as compared with net
                earnings of $246.7 million or $1.21 per common
                share reported in the second quarter of 1995. Net
                sales in the second quarter of 1996 were $2.9
                billion, down 4 percent from the $3 billion
                recorded for the comparable quarter of 1995. </p>
                <p>These results brought 1996 first half earnings
                per common share to $1.24, down 44 percent from
                the $2.21 per common share earned in the first
                half of 1995. Net earnings for the 1996 first
                half were $245 million on net sales of $5.5
                billion as compared to $453 million on net sales
                of $5.7 billion for the same period of 1995. </p>
                <p>&quot;Our 1996 second quarter results
                reflected lower prices for most pulp, paper and
                packaging products compared with the second
                quarter of 1995,&quot; said <b>John W. Creighton,
                Jr.</b>, president and chief executive officer of
                Weyerhaeuser. </p>
                <p>&quot;We began to see improvements in pulp and
                paper shipments in the second quarter. In April,
                selective price increases were announced in some
                paper products, and on July 1 we raised our
                selling price for most grades of pulp. We&#146;re
                encouraged by these increases and if such trends
                continue, we will see improvements in the Pulp,
                Paper and Packaging results in the next quarter.
                However, considerable uncertainty remains around
                growth in world markets, particularly in Europe,
                which is key to the rate of improvement,&quot;
                Creighton added. </p>
                <p>Weyerhaeuser&#146;s Pulp, Paper and Packaging
                segment operating earnings were $35 million for
                the second quarter of 1996 compared with $305
                million for the second quarter of 1995. </p>
                <p>Timberlands and Wood Products segment
                operating earnings were $217 million for the
                second quarter of 1996, compared with $188
                million for the year-ago quarter. </p>
                <p>&quot;Our Timberlands and Wood Products
                segment realized better earnings in the second
                quarter of 1996 compared to last year primarily
                because of higher lumber prices and improved
                operating performance. Structural panels
                realizations were lower than last year&#146;s
                levels because new oriented strandboard capacity
                continues to dampen prices. Lumber markets are
                strong, but uncertain, given the recent increases
                in mortgage interest rates and their potential
                impact on construction activity,&quot; Creighton
                said. </p>
                <p>Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company and
                Weyerhaeuser Financial Services earned $5.5
                million in the quarter, compared with $0.7
                million in the year-ago quarter. </p>

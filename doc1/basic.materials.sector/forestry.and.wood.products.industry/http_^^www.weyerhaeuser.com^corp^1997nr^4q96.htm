                <h3>Weyerhaeuser Reports Lower Earnings, Sales
                for 1996</h3>
                <p> Weyerhaeuser Company today reported net
                earnings for 1996 of $463 million or $2.34 per
                common share. This compares with 1995 net
                earnings of $983 million or $4.83 per common
                share, before a special charge. Net sales in 1996
                were $11.1 billion, compared to $11.8 billion in
                1995. </p>
                <p> &quot;1996 was a year of mixed results,&quot;
                said President Jack Creighton. &quot;Lower prices
                for Pulp, Paper and Packaging products were in
                sharp contrast with the 1995 record levels,
                accounting for the decline in our 1996 earnings.
                Timberlands and Wood Products, driven by solid
                demand in the United States and Japan, enjoyed
                continued good results despite weak panel
                markets. Tight supplies and disruptions related
                to the countervailing duties on imports from
                Canada contributed to strong lumber
                results.&quot; </p>
                <p> Fourth-quarter net earnings for 1996 were $98
                million, or 50 cents per common share, compared
                with the prior year&#146;s fourth-quarter
                earnings of $251 million or $1.25 per common
                share. Net sales in fourth quarter 1996 were $2.8
                billion, down from the $3.1 billion for the
                comparable quarter of 1995. </p>
                <p> Operating earnings for Timberlands and Wood
                Products for 1996 were $805 million, compared to
                $808 million for the previous year. 1996 fourth
                quarter operating earnings were $226 million,
                compared with $183 million in the year-ago
                quarter. </p>
                <p> The company&#146;s Pulp, Paper and Packaging
                businesses had operating earnings of $307 million
                for the year, down from $1.18 billion for all of
                1995. For the fourth quarter of 1996, earnings
                were $31 million, compared to $304 million in the
                comparable quarter of 1995. </p>
                <p> The company&#146;s Real Estate and Financial
                Services businesses earned $43 million in 1996,
                compared with $13 million, before a special
                charge, for the prior year. Those businesses
                reported $22 million in earnings for the fourth
                quarter of 1996, compared with $12 million in the
                year-ago quarter. </p>
                <p> &quot;We begin 1997 with unsettled markets in
                many of our businesses,&quot; Creighton said.
                &quot;But we are well positioned to benefit when
                market conditions improve in our Pulp, Paper and
                Packaging businesses.&quot; </p>

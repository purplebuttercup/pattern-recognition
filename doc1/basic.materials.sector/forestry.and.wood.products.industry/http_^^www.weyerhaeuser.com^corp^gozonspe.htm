                <h2><strong><a name="A2">Introduction:</a> </strong></h2>
                <p>As the pulp and paper industry speeds toward
                the future, it's useful to examine our progress
                and consider where our next steps will take us. </p>
                <p>Let me start with my company's position today.
                Weyerhaeuser is the world's largest producer of
                market pulp and softwood lumber. We own or manage
                over 9 million hectares of forestland in the
                United States and Canada. We're also one of the
                United States' largest recycling companies. </p>
                <p>That perspective gives Weyerhaeuser a clear
                view of the challenge ahead: reducing our
                environmental impact and maintaining healthy,
                diverse forests. </p>
                <p>We accept that challenge. Last year at this
                conference, Weyerhaeuser President Jack Creighton
                described how our company is meeting it by <b>defining
                a clear vision for the future </b>and identifying
                <b>measurable steps to reach our objectives. </b>That
                approach has not changed, but we can see the path
                ahead more clearly than before. So I want to talk
                about two things today: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Making our vision as realistic as
                        possible by taking a holistic approach to
                        manufacturing, and then </li>
                    <li>Staying on course toward our goals by
                        listening to and involving the public. <br>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2><strong><a name="A3">Our vision of the future</a>
                </strong></h2>
                <p>At Weyerhaeuser, we see a future in which we
                manage sustainable forests while protecting
                forest values such as wildlife habitat and water
                quality. We expect to operate efficient,
                increasingly closed-cycle manufacturing
                facilities that produce valued forest products
                without negatively impacting the environment. And
                our plans include a financially successful
                company that satisfies worldwide customers while
                providing incomes for our employees, shareholders
                and the communities in which we operate. </p>
                <p>Those expectations for our future may sound
                complex, and justly so. When viewed from afar,
                anything looks simple. As we approach our goals,
                however, they take three-dimensional shape.
                That's why we're working to perceive- and then
                create-a future that's multi-faceted, that not
                only exists in words but functions in reality.
                The more clearly and realistically we can see
                that future, the more practical steps we can take
                to get there. </p>
                <p>Furthermore, we're finding that progress
                toward our future requires not isolated leaps but
                a series of interconnected steps. Our industry
                has lots of experience thinking about
                manufacturing not as isolated processes, but as
                interdependent systems. We're applying a similar
                approach to our forests-managing the spectrum of
                forest resources, not just the trees. Part of
                today's challenge is to carry that
                multi-dimensional &quot;systems approach&quot; a
                step farther- to our industry's place in human
                society. That requires a holistic perspective
                that considers not only environmental performance
                and ecological balance, but also social and
                economic balances. </p>
                <p>That's a broad perspective. But as we work
                toward our future, it becomes increasingly clear
                that only a holistic view will allow us to take
                sensible steps today while making sure we
                continue to move toward our ultimate goals. </p>
                <p>Let me give you an example. Weyerhaeuser's
                vision includes manufacturing facilities in
                harmony with their environments. The kraft
                pulping process has potential to be one of the
                most efficient industrial processes in existence.
                By closing process cycles, we can substantially
                reduce water use and nearly eliminate waste (and
                environmental impacts). Process chemicals can be
                generated from air and water. Surplus energy can
                help fill the needs of our communities. </p>
                <p>We're getting closer to that goal, but we
                aren't there yet. Our priority is to maintain
                uncompromised product performance and purity
                while we reduce environmental impacts. Recycling
                bleach-plant effluents in a closed-loop process
                represents a significant step. It's not the only
                step, though, and for many mills it may not be
                the most important one to take first. </p>
                <h2><strong><a name="A4">Decision-making for the
                future</a></strong> </h2>
                <p>How do we decide which improvements represent
                the most profound progress for a given situation?
                We believe that sound decision-making requires
                two elements. </p>
                <p>First is a holistic approach that
                incorporates: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Meeting customer needs for product
                        performance and purity. </li>
                    <li>Sustainable forestry. </li>
                    <li>Clean manufacturing through waste
                        reduction. </li>
                    <li>Sustainable economics. </li>
                    <li>Public involvement and open
                        communication.<br>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>To integrate these perspectives into wise
                decisions, we need a second element: <b>a
                discipline for decision-making. </b>Life-cycle
                inventories are one emerging tool for identifying
                and measuring the cumulative environmental
                impacts of a product or process. Such a
                structured approach is then integrated with
                strategic economic planning. Jointly, they ensure
                that our environmental improvement proceeds
                effectively and in a fiscally responsible manner.
                </p>
                <p>That's important because our industry's
                long-term economic success impacts our ability to
                make further environmental improvements. True
                sustainability includes not only sustainable
                forests or sustainable manufacturing, but also
                sustainable economics. At the same time, we at
                Weyerhaeuser believe that financial rewards flow
                inevitably from satisfied customers. Achieving
                that satisfaction requires quality products
                manufactured with minimum waste. That includes
                waste that impacts our environment. Our overall
                task, then, is to minimize negative environmental
                impacts while maximizing our positive economic
                and social impacts. </p>
                <p>To achieve that, Weyerhaeuser is developing
                and implementing a set of <b>Environmental
                Management Systems </b>. They're based on a
                proactive, diagnostic approach to environmental
                decision-making. We expect these systems to help
                us recognize and act on improvement
                opportunities. They will also help us integrate
                multiple efforts to better manage our
                environmental performance from a comprehensive
                viewpoint. </p>
                <p>We're also monitoring the emergence of other
                tools being developed worldwide. Weyerhaeuser
                hopes inter-national cooperation will yield
                credible, workable environmental management
                principles and standards. We expect
                Weyerhaeuser's Environmental Management Systems
                to dovetail with such efforts, and we intend to
                continue participating in their debate,
                development and application. </p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Weyerhaeuser increasingly depends
                on another resource that's helping guide our
                progress. That resource is the public. </p>
                <h2><strong><a name="A5">Listening to the public</a>
                </strong></h2>
                <p>At Weyerhaeuser, we accept responsibility for
                the environmental stewardship of the forests and
                communities in which we operate. To meet that
                responsibility, however, we need to understand a
                variety of perspectives-not just our own.
                Everyone has a stake in a healthy environment and
                sustainable forests. The broader viewpoints of
                our customers, shareholders, employees and
                neighbors can help keep us on track as we
                progress toward the future. Conversely, if we
                don't align ourselves with public values, our
                neighbors can erect market or regulatory barriers
                that make it difficult for us to do business. </p>
                <p>That realization has prompted Weyerhaeuser to <b>actively
                listen to the public </b>. For instance, since
                1994 our company president and an executive vice
                president have held five public meetings in
                Washington and Oregon. Over 1,200 citizens
                participated, many offering impassioned opinions
                on environmental issues, jobs and product
                development. Even participants who were
                dissatisfied with our past performance said they
                appreciated our willingness to listen. So we're
                evaluating more ways to get feedback from our
                neighbors. For example, our operations in Grande
                Prairie, Alberta, and Longview, Washington,
                include community advisory panels. Our goal is to
                form two more ongoing panels in the United States
                by year-end. </p>
                <p>We've also made listening mistakes. In the
                past, when people complained about the appearance
                of harvested areas, we tried to explain the
                benefits of our practices without hearing the
                message that we might need to change them. Today
                Weyerhaeuser foresters are responding to public
                concern about harvest aesthetics by better
                understanding public values, learning about
                landscape architecture, and trying new
                harvest-planning techniques. The results include
                smaller, more irregular harvested areas that
                blend better with the landscape. We'll continue
                such changes to address evolving public views. </p>
                <p>In addition, we're working to incorporate more
                customer input into our daily business. Our
                technical and marketing experts, particularly
                here in Europe, increasingly serve as a channel
                for customers and the public to communicate with
                the company. They've also forged effective
                communication links with governmental agencies
                and environmental organizations. </p>
                <p>These listening efforts are proving essential
                for anticipating public issues and understanding
                market expectations. To take advantage of those
                valuable inputs, however, <b>we must also
                respond.</b> </p>
                <h2><strong><a name="A6">Responding to meet
                expectations</a> </strong></h2>
                <p>At Weyerhaeuser, one way we're responding is
                by incorporating public opinion into our
                management plans. For example, our six regional
                Forest Councils in the United States gathered
                public input on forest protection issues most
                important to the citizens of each region. We
                discovered consistency in people's biggest
                concerns: water and soil quality, wildlife
                habitat and aesthetics, as well as affordable
                wood products. So in October we announced a new
                set of Weyerhaeuser Forestry Resource Goals that
                outline the broad steps our company will take to
                protect these important resources on all our U.S.
                forestlands. Now each Forest Council will use
                what we've heard locally to develop progress
                measurements and implement specific
                forest-management practices that respond to local
                needs in achieving those overall resource goals.
                As we proceed, we will share our performance
                results with the public. </p>
                <p>One of the tools we use to communicate that
                kind of performance information is our
                environmental annual report. It describes our
                objectives, communicates progress, and solicits
                feedback toward continuous improvement in our
                14-mill system. For instance, our 1994 report
                shows a decade of substantial reductions in: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chlorine use. </li>
                    <li>Chlorinated organics. </li>
                    <li>Total suspended solids. </li>
                    <li>Biological oxygen demand. </li>
                    <li>Total reduced sulfur. </li>
                    <li>Total treated effluent. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>When current projects are complete, we expect
                to achieve even greater reductions. But we're
                still not satisfied, and we'll continue working
                toward our minimum-impact goals. </p>
                <p>Finally, we respond to customer input about
                changing market needs. Customers have asked for
                products made with more recycled fiber and less
                chlorine-without sacrificing product quality or
                cost-efficiency. In response, we've doubled our
                use of recycled fiber in the past five years.
                We're currently converting one of our mills to
                use 100 percent recycled fiber. We're also
                participating in a joint venture that's building
                another. This year, Weyerhaeuser will recover
                nearly 3 million tons of wastepaper, and we plan
                to reach 6 million tons by 1998. </p>
                <p>We're also responding to customer concerns
                about product quality and the environment by
                completing over $1 billion in mill modernizations
                in 1995. Modernizations currently planned and
                under way will not only increase product
                performance but also improve air and water
                quality, reduce energy and chemical requirements,
                and enable us to dramatically reduce or eliminate
                all chlorinated organics from our pulp mill
                effluents as we progress toward minimum-impact
                manufacturing. </p>
                <p>So we're <b>listening </b>to market needs and
                public expectations, and we're <b>responding </b>.
                To further speed progress toward our vision,
                Weyerhaeuser is taking one more step: directly <b>involving
                </b>our neighbors. </p>
                <h2><strong><a name="A7">Involvement</a> </strong></h2>
                <p>For example, Weyerhaeuser has found public
                collaboration very effective with our pioneering
                efforts in watershed analysis. In this innovative
                forest-management approach, we work with other
                landowners and interest groups to assess the
                water quality, soil stability and fish habitat of
                a particular forested river basin. Then we
                jointly develop management prescriptions to
                protect and enhance those resources for the
                future. Government officials, Native American
                tribes, university scientists and environmental
                groups participate throughout the process. We
                first tested this proactive, nonregulatory
                approach when we voluntarily initiated Washington
                state's first full-scale watershed analysis in
                1993. That effort addressed 26,000 hectares of
                forestland around the Tolt River, which supplies
                a third of the drinking water for the city of
                Seattle. Since then, Weyerhaeuser has completed
                11 other watershed analyses and plans 5 to 10
                more in 1995. Each is a valuable opportunity to
                involve others in protecting forest resources on
                a large scale. </p>
                <p>The International Model Forest program offers
                another way to involve the public in
                environmental improvement. Weyerhaeuser
                participates in the Prince Albert Model Forest in
                Saskatchewan, Canada. We're working with other
                forestland users there to balance diverse demands
                on forest resources while protecting the
                ecosystem. </p>
                <p>It's a delicate balance. To achieve it-in
                Saskatchewan and on all of the forestland
                Weyerhaeuser manages-we'll continue listening to
                public input and responding to customer needs.
                We're learning as we go. In addition, we believe
                that open communication and public involvement
                are crucial to maintaining consumer confidence in
                us and in our products. </p>
                <p>Constructive dialogue with the public also
                helps warn us of tempting shortcuts that might
                lead us astray from our ultimate goals. For
                example, the feedback Weyerhaeuser has received
                reveals that people's concern about clear-cutting
                reflects a more fundamental worry about overall
                forest conservation and sustainability, including
                water quality, wildlife and biodiversity. Such
                information helps focus finite resources as we
                proceed with the improvements that contribute the
                most toward mutual environmental goals.
                Similarly, our steps toward eliminating
                bleach-plant effluent must be taken with regard
                for impacts on product purity, air quality, solid
                waste and economic feasibility. Such a
                disciplined approach will lead to very different
                conclusions for different mill sites, because we
                have not just today's stage of the journey to
                consider, but tomorrow's as well. </p>
                <h2><strong><a name="A8">The path forward:
                continuous improvement</a> </strong></h2>
                <p>It will take a long, coordinated effort to
                reach our vision of the future. Weyerhaeuser has
                made mistakes, but we're learning. In addition,
                we feel we've taken a significant step away from
                adversarial relationships and toward cooperation,
                which yields better results for everyone. That's
                important because everyone must participate in
                environmental improvement. Our unique
                responsibilities as pulp and paper manufacturers
                include: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating a holistic vision of our future.
                    </li>
                    <li>Setting our course and establishing
                        checkpoints. </li>
                    <li>Communicating openly and involving the
                        public.<br>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>We've made progress toward our vision in 1994.
                We expect to proceed even farther in 1995, and
                beyond. Through unprecedented technological
                innovation and increasing alignment with public
                values, the pulp and paper business holds the
                potential to become the environmental benchmark
                for industry. Already our industry features many
                advantages: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Renewable raw materials. </li>
                    <li>Safe, affordable and indispensable
                        products that contain recycled fiber and
                        can be recycled again. </li>
                    <li>Energy efficiency, with much of our needs
                        generated from natural waste materials. </li>
                    <li>Recovery and reuse of process chemicals.<br>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>To those industry advantages, we can add
                healthy, sustainable forests; holistic,
                minimum-impact manufacturing; and community
                involvement and communication. But only if we
                stay on course, make wise and disciplined
                choices, and listen. We at Weyerhaeuser are
                prepared and eager for that challenge. </p>

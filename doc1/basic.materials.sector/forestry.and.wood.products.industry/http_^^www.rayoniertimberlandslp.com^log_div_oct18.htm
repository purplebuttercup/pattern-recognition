<h2>Earnings, Distributions And Other 
News</h2>
<H3>Rayonier Timberlands, L.P. Announces Fourth Quarter Distribution</H3>
<B>STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT,</B>
	October 18, 1996 - Rayonier Forest Resources 
Company, the managing general partner of Rayonier Timberlands, L.P. (NYSE:LOG), today 
announced a fourth quarter distribution of $1.33 per Class A Unit payable December 31, 1996 to 
unitholders of record November 29, 1996. A portion of this distribution represents return of 
capital, depending on each unitholder's tax basis.
<P>
	Rayonier Forest Resources noted that when it announced the first quarter 1996 
distribution of $1.43, it said it expected that subsequent quarters’ distributions would be less. 
Distributions are intended to approximate actual Partnership results each year by keeping the 
distribution relatively constant in the second, third and fourth quarters and by making an 
adjustment in the first quarter of the year following to bring the cumulative distribution in line with 
Partnership results.
<P>
	Rayonier Forest Resources continues to caution unitholders that the market value of 
Class A Units is expected to decline substantially as the end of the Initial Term approaches 
December 31, 2000. Class A unitholders are generally entitled to 95 percent of Partnership 
earnings and cash flows during the 15-year Initial Term, which began in 1985. After the year 
2000, Class A unitholders will only have a 4 percent interest in Partnership revenues, expenses 
and cash flow. On a <EM>pro forma</EM> basis, using 1995 results as an example, cash 
allocable per Class A Unit would decline from $6.17 for the full year to approximately 22 cents. 
In addition, on December 31, 2000, the Secondary Account is expected to have debt (incurred 
to fund long-term investment in such areas as reforestation and silvicultural activities including 
accrued interest) of over $350 million, more than three times 1995’s net operating cash flow. In 
accordance with the Partnership Agreement, all Secondary Account debt must be repaid before 
any distribution of Partnership cash flow resumes.
<P>
	Rayonier Timberlands, L.P. grows and sells timber in the U.S. on 782,000 acres in the 
Southeast and on 369,000 acres in the Northwest. Rayonier Inc., the Special General Partner, 
owns 74.7 percent of the 20 million outstanding Class A Units of Rayonier Timberlands, L.P. The 
balance is publicly traded on the NYSE.

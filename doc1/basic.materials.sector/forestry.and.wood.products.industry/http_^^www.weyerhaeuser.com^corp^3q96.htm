                <h1 align="left"><strong>Weyerhaeuser's 1996<br>
                3rd-quarter earnings </strong></h1>
                <p align="left">On October 15, 1996, Weyerhaeuser
                reported net earnings of $119.7 million, or 60
                cents per common share for the third quarter of
                1996 compared with net earnings of $279.3 million
                or $1.37 cents per common share before a special
                charge of $184.5 reported in the third quarter of
                1995. </p>
                <p align="left">Net sales in the third quarter of
                1996 were $2.9 billion, down six percent from the
                $3 billion recorded for the comparable quarter of
                1995. </p>
                <p align="left">Third quarter results brought
                year-to-date earnings per common share to $1.84,
                down 49 percent compared to 1995 record earnings
                of $3.58 for the same period of last year before
                the special charge. Net earnings year to date
                were $364.9 million on sales of $8.3 billion
                compared to $732.6 million in earnings before the
                special charge on sales of $8.7 billion for the
                same period of 1995. </p>
                <p align="left">&quot;Our 1996 third quarter
                results reflected strong lumber prices in both
                domestic and Japanese markets, and improving pulp
                prices,&quot; said John W. Creighton Jr.,
                president and chief executive officer of
                Weyerhaeuser. &quot;The higher volumes and lower
                operating costs achieved by our business
                improvement plans help offset continuing weak
                pricing in paper and packaging products. </p>
                <p align="left">Operating earnings for the
                Timberlands and Wood Products segment were $210
                million for the third quarter of 1996 compared
                with $195.8 million for the third quarter of
                1995. </p>
                <p align="left">Third quarter 1996 Pulp, Paper
                and Packaging segment operating earnings were
                $78.8 million compared with $364.5 million for
                the year-ago quarter. </p>
                <p align="left">Third quarter earnings for the
                Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company and Weyerhaeuser
                Financial Services Inc. were $5.2 million
                compared to a loss of $2.9 million before a
                special charge in the third quarter of 1995. </p>
                <p align="left">Weyerhaeuser also announced that
                it has repurchased 9.6 million shares of the 10
                million shares of stock authorized for repurchase
                by the Weyerhaeuser Company Board of Directors in
                April 1995. The company said that the board has
                increased the authorization by an additional one
                million to a total of 11 million shares to offset
                shares issued in conjunction with a recent
                acquisition. </p>

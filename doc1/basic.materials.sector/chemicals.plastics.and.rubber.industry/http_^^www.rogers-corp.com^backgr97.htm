These products are sold for applications in the communication,
transportation, computer, imaging and consumer markets. </p>

<p>Major manufacturing facilities of Rogers and its joint
ventures are located in the U.S., Japan, and Belgium. Most are
registered to ISO-9000 quality standards.</p>

<p>One of the oldest, publicly traded companies in continuous
operation, Rogers was founded in 1832 as a manufacturer of
specialty materials. Its stock (AMEX:ROG) is traded on the
American and Pacific Stock Exchanges.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>High Frequency and Microwave Circuit
Materials</b></font><b> </b></p>

<p>Rogers sells a broad variety of high frequency and microwave
circuit board laminates for circuitry in wireless communication
systems. Rogers has served the communication industry for three
decades, from the first military radar systems and throughout the
remarkable transition to commercial wireless communication
technology. Rogers circuit materials are used all over the world
in cellular telephony and paging, satellite television, global
positioning and navigation, electronic inventory control and
tracking, and security systems.</p>

<p>Laminate products include the cost effective <a
href="ro3003.htm">RO3000</a><font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font>,
and<a href="mwu/ro4000.htm"> </a><a href="ro4000.htm">RO4000®
laminates</a>, for circuits used in commercial wireless
transmitters, receivers, pagers, and telephones. Rogers also
offers <a href="5880.htm">DUROID®, RT/duroid® </a>and <a
href="tmdata.htm">TMM® laminates</a> for circuitry in high
performance or military transmitters, receivers, radar, and
guidance systems.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Flexible Circuit Materials</b></font></p>

<p>Rogers combined expertise in polymers, adhesion, and coating
helps provide specialty laminates for making high performance,
flexible printed circuits. Products include a range of laminates
for selected applications in hard disk drives and portable
computers. Most manufacturers of this equipment use Rogers<a
href="cmu/prodsel.htm"> R/flex® flexible laminate materials </a>to
make moving interconnections, where millions of flexures can be
expected. </p>

<p>Dynamic, high performance applications include the read-write
suspension assemblies in disk drives and the hinge
interconnections in portable computers. R/flex flexible circuit
materials are also used to help downsize equipment, such as for
smart battery interconnections in cellular telephones.</p>

<p>In a major new development, Hutchinson Technology
Incorporated, the leading manufacturer of suspension assemblies,
uses a<a href="cmu/fleximid.htm"> FLEX-I-MID® adhesiveless
material</a> for its new generation of suspensions used with
magneto-resistive heads in hard disk drives. This material is
manufactured for Rogers, in Japan, by Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals,
Inc., under a partnership arrangement which includes a technology
license from Rogers.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Industrial Multilayer Films</strong></font></p>

<p>Rogers Induflex<font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font> materials
are thin aluminum and copper laminates for shielding
electromagnetic and radio frequency interference (EMI/RFI).
Sheilding laminates incorporate polyesters, adhesives, coatings,
and other materials, and are converted into specialty tapes that
shield telecommunication and data communication cables.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>High Performance Elastomers</b></font></p>

<p>Rogers elastomer products include high performance urethane
and silicone foam materials, specialty materials, and high
performance urethane and silicone based components. </p>

<p><a href="pmu/aboutpmu.htm">PORON® urethane </a>and <a
href="bisco/aboutbmu.htm">silicone foam materials </a>are used
for a wide range of applications in all of Rogers key market
areas. They are fabricated into an extraordinary variety of
gaskets, pads, and cushions that seal enclosures, absorb shock
and vibration, and otherwise provide protection and cushioning.
Their high performance qualities set them apart from commodity
type foams.</p>

<p>Rogers recently introduced a new PORON urethane formulation
that is flame retardant and has low outgassing properties. These
characteristics are important for use in automotive applications,
as well as for computers, disk drives, and other sensitive
electronic equipment. </p>

<p>At the beginning of 1997, Rogers acquired the leading
manufacturer of high performance silicone foams, the former Bisco
Products business of Dow Corning. This acquisition makes Rogers
the leading supplier of high performance silicone foams to
manufacturers of automobiles, commercial aircraft, trains, and
buses. These specialty foams are now sold under the PORON brand
name, and extend the applications of PORON materials to high
temperature gasketing, flame retardance, and heat shielding.</p>

<p>Several elastomer product lines are directed to specific niche
markets, having evolved to create unique solutions, or fulfill an
industry's specific requirements. The products couple elastomer
technology with related expertise in coatings or adhesion.</p>

<p><a href="rbak.htm">R/bak® </a>and R/stik products are
compressible printing plate mounting and backing materials. They
are manufactured for the flexographic printing industry, where
demand for high quality printing on packaging materials is
spurring rapid growth. Rogers R/bak materials are consumable
products that significantly improve the quality of graphics
printed on boxes, bags, labels, cans, and other product
packaging. Rogers works closely with major manufacturers of
printing presses and plates in the ongoing development of this
technology.</p>

<p>PORON foams are used for cushioning in footwear, foot comfort
insoles, and medical insoles and appliances. It is estimated that
over 250 million pair of shoes have been made more comfortable
with the use of a PORON insole material designed into the shoe.
In addition, many of the foot comfort products manufactured under
the Dr. Sholl's brand incorporate PORON foams.</p>

<p><a href="ecu/nitrophy.htm">NITROPHYL®</a> floats are nitrile
rubber products are used for level sensing, primarily in fuel
tanks. The Elastomer Components Unit, where floats are
manufactured, has achieved QS 9000 status, a universal standard
for automotive quality.</p>

<p>Nearly every major manufacturer of imaging equipment uses an <a
href="ecu/endur.htm">ENDUR® </a>elastomer component for document
handling. These customized components are used in high
performance printers, copiers, postal sorters, and facsimile
machines to move, prepare, and help print documents. </p>

<p>The many different products in the ENDUR family illustrate the
diversity of applications in imaging equipment. A line of fuser
rollers are used to fix images in high performance copiers. ENDUR
belts and rollers are made of solid or foamed elastomers,
including urethane, polyisoprene, and silicone.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>MEKTRON Bus Bars</b></font></p>

<p>Rogers N.V. has been a leader in European power distribution
systems for over twenty-five years. <a href="busbar.htm">MEKTRON®
bus bars</a> are used in cellular communication base stations,
telephone switching systems, trains, and industrial equipment.
Manufacturing facilities in Gent, Belgium, include a high voltage
and amperage design and test facility for customer applications.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Moldable Composites</b></font></p>

<p>Rogers <a href="molding.htm">Moldable composites</a> are sold
for use in cars, trucks, and other vehicles, and for appliances,
electric motors, and other electrical and electronic
applications. In automotive applications, parts molded of RX and
MPC composites can supplant the use of heavier, machined metal
parts in transmissions and engines, for improved performance and
price.</p>

<p>In appliances for the home and garden, parts molded from
Rogers composites are used to help shield heat or insulate
electricity in irons, chain saws, hedge trimmers, and the like.
Most electric motors also use molded parts for commutator hubs.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Nonwoven Materials</b></font></p>

<p>Rogers also offers a line of specialty <a href="cpmindex.htm">nonwoven
materials.</a> Made of natural and synthetic fibers, they are
used for padding, thermal insulation, and prefilter applications.<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>Joint Ventures</b></font></p>

<p><b><i>Rogers INOAC Corporation (RIC)</i></b><br>
A wholly owned, 50/50% joint venture of INOAC Corporation and
Rogers, RIC is a major Japan based manufacturer of elastomer
materials and components. The combined resources of the two
parent companies provide technical and market leadership in niche
markets.</p>

<p>RIC manufactures PORON urethane and silicone foam materials
and ENDUR components, supplying manufacturing activities in Japan

in the U.S. for PORON and ENDUR products, manufacturing in Europe
for ENDUR components, and stocking capabilities in Europe for
PORON materials, Rogers and RIC are able to serve customers who
have global design, service, and supply requirements.</p>

<p><b><i>DUREL Electroluminescent Lamps</i></b><br>
<a href="el.htm">Durel Corporation,</a> a leading manufacturer of
electroluminescent (EL) lamps and inverters, was formed in 1988
as a wholly owned, 50/50% joint venture of 3M and Rogers
Corporation.</p>

<p>Durel is focused on high volume applications in the
automotive, wireless communication, and timepiece markets. The EL
indicators and displays in several popular car models are made by
Durel Corporation. The company's lamps are qualified for use by
three major U.S. car companies. Durel's automotive sales are
handled by 3M.</p>

<p>DUREL lamp systems are also lighting the keypads and displays
in pagers, personal organizers, and cellular telephones, where
their low consumption of battery power gives them an advantage.
EL lamps are now commonly used to illuminate watches. Durel
Corporation, working with the U.S. based Timex Corporation, was
the first to invent and manufacture a cost effective and high
performance EL lamp that could be used in watches and other small
items. The positive market response has helped to change consumer
expectations for attractive dials and displays -- for many
products -- that are readable in low light. Durel's communication
and timepiece sales are handled by Rogers.</p>

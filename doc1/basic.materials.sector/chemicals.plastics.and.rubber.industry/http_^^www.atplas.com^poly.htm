	<TD>Across North America, the electrical industry has been searching for ways to increase the lifespan and reduce the failure rate and cost of <A HREF="wire.htm"><STRONG>power cables</STRONG></A>. AT Plastics introduced customers to its Aqua-Link specialty compounds - originally licensed from Mitsubishi Petrochemical - providing excellent performance and significant cost savings over traditional materials used to insulate low voltage power cable.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
A number of large cable manufacturers now use our Aqua-Link product at their North
American plants. Aqua-Link provides excellent growth opportunities, in a market with
a potential size of $100 million in Canada and the United States.<P>

Sales of high EVA copolymers to the adhesives market increased grown to about 13 per
cent of Polymers' sales, compared to 2 per cent in 1989. Our customer list  includes
large international customers as well as about 25 smaller manufacturers in Canada,
the United States and Pacific Rim.<P>

Sales have grown substantially in the thermal Laminations market in which AT Plastics
has a large market share. Sales of medium EVA copolymers to this market have grown
to about 14% of Polymer Sales, as compared to about 2% in 1989. In the future, we
expect to increase sales as our customers expand their operations significantly.<P>

We are collaborating with customers and equipment suppliers on the development of
new technology for the production of micro-cellular foams. These foams are used in
the manufacture of sport shoes and other goods, and the new process could
significantly lower costs for this industry.

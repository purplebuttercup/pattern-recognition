	<TD valign=middle>In our Packaging Business, we have expanded sales of heavy-duty industrial shipping sacks of polymers, chemicals, explosives, peat moss and fertilizers. We have also positioned the Company for profitable growth in performance films, used to manufacture courier pouches and high-barrier packaging.</TD>

</TABLE>

We are now realizing some of the benefits of our patented oriented films. We are excited about this technology which creates stiffer, stronger packaging materials that reduce the amount of material used and provides superior performance for end products.  We have developed a new oriented film package for explosives in Canada and the United States and potentially elsewhere.<P>

We have worked with suppliers to the rubber and plastics industry to develop innovative "batch incorporation" sacks, particularly in the United States. These sacks disperse with their contents in our customers' product to reduce waste and enable customers to meet changing environmental regulations and needs.

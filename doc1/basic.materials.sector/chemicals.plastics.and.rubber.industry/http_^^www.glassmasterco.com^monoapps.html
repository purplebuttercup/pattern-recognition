<FONT SIZE=-1>Although Glassmaster is not the largest manufacturer of monofilaments, our technical expertise, knowledge and capabilities are comprehensive; our equipment and facilities state-of-the-art.  And we are recognized for producing specialty monofilaments of the highest quality for a myriad of industrial applications.<P>

Through the years we have found our size works to the distinct advantage of our customers in that we can respond to requests for custom products quickly and efficiently.  At Glassmaster, quantity is never an issue.  Producing quality on time and at a fair price is.<P>

<IMG SRC=sewing.gif> is offered in a variety of polymers from very fine to medium deniers.  Clear; natural; and light, medium and dark smoke provide excellent color matching and blending for all types of fabrics.

We also offer UV stabilized monofilaments for specific outdoor applications.<P>

<IMG SRC=cutting.gif>As one of the largest producers of cutting line, we produce sizes from .040 to .150 inches for all types of lawn care equipment.  Unique co-polymers are blended together for maximum wear and overall cutting performance.  We are currently developing and test marketing a variety of specialized extruded shapes such as triangles and stars to improve cutability and extend the life of the cutting line.  Glassmaster cutting line is available in bulk packaging for industrial users as well as consumer packaging for retail.<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1><IMG SRC=weaving.gif>are designed for specialized customer applications such as narrow and wide tape weaving for apparel usage, braided tubes for electrical harnesses, filtration fabric for water purification and mining conveyor belts.<P>

Products are available in the following polymers:  Nylon 6, Nylon 6/6, Nylon 11, Nylon 12, PEEK, RYTION, PET-type Polyester, PBT-type Polyester, Polypropylenes, Polyolefins (low, medium, high density), HALAR, VECTRA, and PPS.<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1><IMG SRC=clothing.gif>Our expertise in creating superior monofilaments led us into the filter fabric industry.  We produce monofilaments for the fourdenier, wet press and dryer sections of paper machinery offering excellent hydrolysis, wear and abrasion resistance, and enhanced stain release properties.<P>

Available products include:  Hydrolysis-resistant Polyester, Heat Stabilized Nylons, PEEK, Alloys, PPS and specialized monofilaments in various modulus and tenacity.<P>

Purchased in September, 1988 from Allied-Signal, Inc., Nybrad<SUP>&reg</SUP> is the latest addition to the glassmaster monofilament line-up.  Nybrad<SUP>&reg</SUP> is a heat-stabilized monofilament comprised of rylon resin and up to 40 percent abrasive grit is determinded by the end use.  Principal users are industrial brushmakers who take advantage of the monofilament's flexibility and uniform grit dispersion for metal and wood finishing.<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>The Nybrad<SUP>&reg</SUP> acquisition was a natural, offering a wealth of opportunity for expansion.  Once again we are utilizing our size to supply Nybrad<SUP>&reg</SUP> to riche markets.  In addition to a diversity of standard sizes and grits, we also design and produce Nybad for custom applications.<BR>

<CENTER><IMG SRC=wires.jpg></CENTER><BR>

Specialized users can order very small to large quantities economically and have them delivered on a timely basis.<P>

Nybrad<SUP>&reg</SUP> has proved an invaluable tool in deburring, scrubbing and finishing flat surfaces and complex shaped fabricated products, handling such jobs faster, more economically and with less mess than other materials.  Success has created new demands.  We are currently developing stiffer, more aggressive versions to attack harder ship metal deposits and burrs.  New Nybrad<SUP>&reg</SUP> variations employing Nylon 6/10, Nylon 6/12 and other polymers are all being developed so that we may continue to provide top quality performance products for new and innovative applications.<P>

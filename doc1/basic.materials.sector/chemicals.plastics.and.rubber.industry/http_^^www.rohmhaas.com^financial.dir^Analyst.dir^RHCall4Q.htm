Analyst Conference Call</H2></I>

<HR = 4>
<P><I>January 22, 1997</I></P>

<P>Rohm and Haas Company released fourth quarter and full-year 1996 earnings
on Wednesday,<BR>
January 22nd. Later that morning, Bill Andrews (Corporate Controller), Fred
Shaffer (Chief<BR>
Financial Officer) and Larry Wilson (Chief Executive Officer) participated
in a conference call with<BR>
financial analysts. What follows is a synopsis of that session.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="rhexec.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE" WIDTH="502" HEIGHT=

<P>As the meeting began, Larry Wilson said, &quot;Quite simply, 1996 was
a very good year for Rohm<BR>
and Haas. We ended the year on a very strong note -- fourth quarter unit
volume was up 14<BR>
percent, and earnings per share was up 19 percent higher than in 1995. For
the full year, earnings<BR>
per common share were up 29 percent on 6 percent volume growth.&quot;</P>

<P>Wilson noted that the profitable growth trend that began at mid-year
continued with increasing<BR>
strength during the fourth quarter. The company's core acrylic businesses
were the drivers for that<BR>
growth. On a regional basis, Latin America had an outstanding quarter and
its best earnings year<BR>
ever. Earnings for that region were $32 million.</P>

<P><U>Highlights:</U></P>


<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Polymers and Resins, the company's largest business, reported a 17
  percent volume increase for<BR>
  the quarter; all market segments reported good growth.
</UL></P>


<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Monomer volume was up 41 percent. The sales increase included about
  $20 million because of<BR>
  additional business gained when Hoechst Celanese had production difficulties.
  Wilson<BR>
  estimated that this added approximately $4 million to earnings.
</UL>

</P>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Plastics Additives grew in all regions, leading to a 20 percent increase
  in volume over the fourth<BR>
  quarter of 1995.
</UL>

</P>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>AtoHaas North America also showed good growth, with a 7 percent volume
  increase. AtoHaas<BR>
  Europe reported lower operating losses than earlier in the year. Total
  losses for the fourth<BR>
  quarter were $5.5 million -- $1.8 million from ongoing operations, and
  $3.7 million for Rohm<BR>
  and Haas's portion of restructuring costs.
</UL>
</P>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Ion Exchange Resins slowed production during the quarter to reduce
  inventories and thus lost a<BR>
  little money. However, they reported a major profit improvement for the
  year.
</UL>

</P>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Agricultural Chemicals reported an 8 percent sales increase and an
  18 percent earnings<BR>
  improvement for the quarter, excluding credit for profit on the sale of
  land in Japan.
</UL>

</P>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Volume was up 14 percent for the company for the quarter. Growth would
  have been 16 percent<BR>
  without the impact of the formation of the RohMax joint venture (our former
  Petroleum<BR>
  Chemicals business) was excluded.
</UL>

</P>

<P>
<UL>
  <LI>While volume was up 14 percent, sales growth was just 5 percent. The
  difference reflects the<BR>
  impact of lower currency values in Europe and Japan, 3 percent lower selling
  prices, and<BR>
  higher sales of lower-priced products, mainly emulsions.
</UL>
</P>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Raw material prices were 3 percent below the fourth quarter of 1995.
  The net effect is that selling<BR>
  price reductions exceeded raw material price decreases by approximately
  $18 million, pre-tax.
</UL>

</P>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Below-the-line costs (selling, administrative and research expenses)
  were slightly below the<BR>
  levels for the fourth quarter of 1995. Excluding the impact of the formation
  of the RohMax<BR>
  joint venture ($6 million), SAR expenses are higher this year, due to a
  higher bonus accrual<BR>
  and slight increases in spending.
</UL>

</P>

<UL>
  <LI>The quarter included these non-recurring items:

</P>

<P>Without these items, pre-tax earnings would have been up 12 percent for
the quarter, and earnings<BR>
per share would have been up 27 percent.</P>

<P><B><U>Bill Young, Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette</U><BR>
Can you give further detail about why Agricultural Chemicals performed so
well<BR>
in the fourth quarter?<BR>
</B>Ag Chem results were up in every region, except Europe. Sales of Dithane
fungicide were<BR>
especially strong in Latin America. In addition to increased sales of Dithane,
the business saw<BR>
good growth in its newer products -- the herbicides based on pyridine chemistry,
the MAC (molt<BR>
accelerating compound) insecticide products, and Goal herbicide.</P>

<P><B>Would you comment on any trend you saw in raw material pricing, and
your<BR>
outlook for 1997? What kind of guidance are you giving your managers?</B><BR>


There was a slight upward trend in raw material costs from the third
to the fourth quarter, and we<BR>
expect to see that trend continue into the first quarter of 1997 for most
of our raw materials. The<BR>
exception is acetone, which has come down in price.</P>

<P>What we're telling our managers is what we always tell them when raw
material costs go up --<BR>
raise selling prices and get back any lost margin as soon as possible. Using
acrylic emulsions as an<BR>
example -- we have implemented a price increase effective at the beginning
of 1997 of 2 1/2 percent<BR>
for the United States. When this is fully effective, we'll end up about
even.</P>

<P><B><U>Frank Mitsch, Merrill Lynch</U><BR>
Polymers &amp; Resins had great volume growth at the end of the year. Do
you expect<BR>
that kind of demand to continue through 1997?<BR>
</B>You won't see volume growth of 14 percent on an ongoing basis, but we
do expect Polymers &amp;<BR>
Resins to grow above GDP rates again in 1997. Ongoing volume growth should
be in the range of<BR>
7 to 8 percent.</P>

<P><B>Can you comment on the AtoHaas Europe restructuring?<BR>
</B>Our partner in the joint venture, Elf Atochem, took action early in
January to affect a substantial<BR>
reduction of costs in Europe. We expect AtoHaas Europe's financial performance
to improve<BR>
gradually as 1997 progresses.</P>

<P><B>How is Shipley doing? What is the trend there?<BR>
</B>Fourth quarter sales for Shipley were the highest they were at any point
in 1996. It looks to us as<BR>
though the inventory correction that took place in the semiconductor industry
in the second and<BR>
third quarter of last year is over. We expect continued good growth in this
business in 1997.</P>

<P><B><U>Ted Semegran, Dean Witter Reynolds</U><BR>
Do you expect to see volume increases in the first quarter of 1997 of the
same<BR>
magnitude as you did in the fourth quarter of 1996?<BR>
</B>If economic conditions continue to look good. We would expect another
favorable volume<BR>
comparison during the first quarter. You might recall that volume growth
disappeared for us from<BR>
March 1995 to May 1996, then returned. Our volume comparisons should look
good for the first<BR>
half of 1997, but it will be harder to get dramatic increases on a comparative
basis as the year<BR>
continues.</P>

<P><B>What are the operating levels for your acrylic acid plant?<BR>
</B>We're currently running our acrylic acid manufacturing plant at better
than 100 percent of<BR>
nameplate. We've reason to believe that the industry overall is running
at rates in the high 90<BR>
percent range. 1997. We will be adding capacity at our plant in Houston
at mid-year, as will<BR>
BASF. LG is adding additional capacity in Korea. With demand growth of about
5 to 6 percent,<BR>
we would expect to see industry capacity utilization to be in the 90 to
95 percent range.</P>

<P><B>Are you buying acrylic acid?<BR>
</B>We have long-term contracts with a number of suppliers, but we are currently
purchasing at<BR>
contract minimums, as opposed to the maximum levels earlier on.</P>

<P><B>What's the outlook for your plans for an acrylic acid facility in
Europe?<BR>
</B>Nothing has changed. We purchased land last fall, and are prepared to
build if we have to.<BR>
However, we intend to postpone building anything as long as we can. With
capacity coming into<BR>
the market from Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan and Korea, we don't want to
do anything that puts<BR>
the market out of balance -- and we believe we can get further efficiencies
out of our existing plant<BR>
in Houston.</P>

<P>As we see it today, it doesn't seem like there will be a need for us
to bring another plant on-stream<BR>
until after 2000 or 2001.</P>

<P><B><U>Jeff Spetalnick, Oppenheimer</U><BR>
Can you comment on demand for methyl methacrylate?<BR>
</B>Our MMA plant ran at about 80-85 percent of capacity throughout 1996.
We have not been affected<BR>
like other producers because we currently are not a big supplier to the
merchant market. Most of<BR>
the MMA we make is consumed internally for our plastics and acrylic emulsion
products.</P>

<P><B><U>Avi Nash, Goldman Sachs</U><BR>
Can you be more specific about where demand is coming from in Polymers and<BR>
Resins? What end markets look strong to you?<BR>
</B>There was good growth in products for the paper market. Sales of hollow-sphere
pigment for both<BR>
paper and paint also were strong. In addition, Latin American business was
good. Demand was up<BR>
in Asia-Pacific and in Europe as well. Looking ahead, we don't expect to
see lots of future quarters<BR>
with 16 percent volume growth, in part because the fourth quarter comparison
was helped by a<BR>
lousy fourth quarter in 1995. Over the past decade, Polymers &amp; Resins
has shown growth in the 7<BR>
to 8 percent range. If economies hold up, we would expect that kind of growth
in the future.</P>

<P><B><U>Nick Spencer, Sanford Bernstein</U><BR>
Were you surprised by anything you saw in the fourth quarter numbers?<BR>
</B>In all honesty, the quarter turned out pretty much the way we expected
it would.</P>

<P><B>The tax rate was low. Will that continue into 1997?<BR>
</B>We would expect our steady state tax rate to be about 33 percent.</P>

<P><B>And capital spending? What does that look like for 1997?<BR>
</B>We spent $334 million in 1996. We expect capital spending to be around
$350 million in 1997.</P>

<P><B>Will you continue to repurchase shares?<BR>
</B>We brought in 4.4 million shares in 1996 under two authorizations from
our Board of Directors.<BR>
We have 2.6 million shares remaining under the second repurchase authorization.
We would hope<BR>
to bring them in quickly, as market conditions allow.</P>

<P><B><U>James Wilbur, Smith Barney<U></U></U><BR>
What's your outlook for the European Region?<BR>
</B>Without the impact of the losses at AtoHaas Europe, our European earnings
would have been up<BR>
10 percent for the year. We expect to see continued improvement in Europe
in 1997, as the losses<BR>
at AtoHaas decrease, and as economies pick up. Just looking at the same
economic forecasts that<BR>
all of you see, indications are that the U.S. economy will have a better
1997 than Europe. Still our<BR>
history in Europe shows that Haas's business grows faster than the overall
European GDP.</P>

<P><B><U>Jeff Spetalnick, Oppenheimer</U><BR>
Comment, please on the performance of the Biocides business.<BR>
</B>Biocides is our most profitable business, with the best return on assets
of any of the 10 businesses<BR>
we run. However, we're not seeing the double-digit growth that we once did.</P>

<P>We're approaching market maturity in water treatment and a few other
end-use markets, but we are<BR>
hoping for good growth in marine, wood and plastic applications.</P>

<P><B><U>Andy Cash, NatWest Securities</U><BR>
If you could discuss acrylic acid again for a moment. With the industry
running at<BR>
very high rates, has there been any indication of customers substituting
other<BR>
products in their processes or having to wait for deliveries?</B></P>

<P>We have had no problem delivering acrylic acid to our customers, and
don't anticipate any<BR>
problems in the future. And to our knowledge, no other producer has had
problems, except for the<BR>
temporary outage at Hoecsht-Celanese late last year.</P>

<P><B>With new acrylic acid capacity coming into the market in 1997, are
you doing any discounting?<BR>
</B>No, none at all. We supply acrylic acid to very few merchant customers.
The product we sell to<BR>
our largest customers is sold on a formula price. And you can be darn sure
we are not discounting<BR>
emulsion prices to fill up our monomer plants.</P>

<P><B>You have a phenomenal balance sheet. Cash flow appears to be strong.
Any early thoughts on what you might do with it? Additional buybacks? Acquisitions?<BR>
</B>We have been buying shares pretty aggressively. We expect to continue
to do that whenever<BR>
possible. As for acquisitions, if we can find an acquisition candidate that
is a logical fit with our<BR>
organization and one that adds immediate earnings to the company, then we
would seriously<BR>
consider it. We won't make dilutive acquisitions.</P>

<P><B><U>Paul Raman, Paine Webber</U><BR>
How has the Haas family reacted to the stock buy back, the recent increase
in<BR>
stock price and your plans to grow the business for the long term?<BR>
</B>The Haas family pays attention to the same things any other large shareholder
does. They are<BR>
happy to see us do well. I don't think they follow the stock price on a
daily basis, but they want to<BR>
see us prosper and grow and to continue to improve our return to shareholders.
That's exactly<BR>
what we want to do, too.</P>

<P>It should be noted that we're using our excess cash to buy back stock,
but that doesn't pre-empt us<BR>
from considering acquisitions. We have ample capacity to raise capital to
make acquisitions as<BR>
well.</P>

<P><B><U>George Stairs, Putnam Investments</U><BR>
Can your provide some of the balance sheet items?<BR>
</B>At quarter end, cash was about $11 million, short-term debt was $144
million; long-term debt<BR>
$562 million, and stockholders' equity was $1,728 million.</P>

<P><B><U>Kate O'Conner, Morgan Stanley</U><BR>
For the second year in a row, your Ag business has broken with its traditional<BR>
seasonal pattern. Is there any fundamental change that has taken place?
Will this<BR>
trend continue in the future?<BR>
</B>As the business has grown globally, we see less and less &quot;seasonality&quot;
in the numbers. There was<BR>
a time when Dithane sales in Europe had a dominant effect in pushing a peak
in Ag sales in the<BR>
second quarter. However, business has grown dramatically in Latin America
and in Asia-Pacific.<BR>
We don't see seasonality the way we once did.</P>

<P><B><U>Ted Semegran, Dean Witter Reynolds</U><BR>
Can you give a bit more detail about the currency effect in the fourth quarter?<BR>
What does the currency picture look like going forward?<BR>
</B>The overall net effect on our earnings per share was a positive 1 cent
for the quarter, with an<BR>
adverse impact on operating income exposure of about 2 cents, offset by
balance sheet items.</P>

<P>It's mighty difficult to predict what might happen with currencies. The
one thing that remains true<BR>
for Rohm and Haas is that a 1 percent change in our market basket of currencies
will have an effect<BR>
on our earnings per share of about 1 to 2 cents per share.</P>

<P><B><U>Avi Nash, Goldman Sachs</U><BR>
Could you comment on profit margins?<BR>
</B>Our margins improved as 1996 progressed. They looked pretty good in
the fourth quarter. They<BR>
are not the highest they've ever been, but we're close to where we were
at the end of 1994 -- very<BR>
healthy.</P>

<P>Looking forward, a lot will depend upon raw material costs. Obviously
when raw materials like<BR>
propylene cost us 12 to 13 cents a pound, margins look better than they
do when propylene costs<BR>
us 27 to 28 cents a pound.</P>

<P>However, we're not waiting for raw material pricing to change. We're
still driving costs out of our<BR>
business and making ourselves more efficient in every way. You could see
that that efficiency paid<BR>
off for us in the fourth quarter. The effect is right there on the bottom
line.</P>

<P>I would hope anyone who follows us would give us some credit for our
below-the-line<BR>
improvements. We've brought selling, administrative and research costs down
to 20.5 percent of<BR>
sales -- we're back below 1985 levels!</P>

<P><B><U>Jeff Spetalnick, Oppenheimer</U><BR>
Can you comment on your Shipley business? What's the split these days between<BR>
the two business segments there?<BR>
</B>Shipley sales are about 45 percent on the printed wiring board side,
and about 55 percent on the<BR>
microelectronics/semiconductor side. The fastest growth is occurring on
the semiconductor side,<BR>
and we expect to see that trend continue.</P>

<P>Shipley did well in 1996, and they ended the year with a strong December.
That should continue.<BR>
We didn't see the weakness in our business that others in the semiconductor
business felt at mid-<BR>
year. Business was especially strong in Asia-Pacific and in the United States.</P>

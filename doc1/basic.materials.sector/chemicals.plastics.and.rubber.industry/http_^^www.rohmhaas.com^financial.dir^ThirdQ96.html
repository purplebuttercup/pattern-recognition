          <H2>CHAIRMAN'S LETTER</H2>
        </CENTER>


<P>Strong volume growth, good internal cost control and lower raw material
costs enabled Rohm and Haas to report excellent earnings for the third quarter
-- a 54 percent increase in earnings per common share.</P>

<P>Unit volume improved 8 percent overall, with our two largest acrylic
businesses -- Polymers and Resins and Plastics Additives -- reporting volume
improvements in nearly every geographic region for the second quarter in
a row. Agricultural Chemicals, Formulation Chemicals, AtoHaas, Ion Exchange
Resins and Biocides also reported volume increases. Clearly we have regained
momentum, and our core acrylic businesses are back on a solid growth track.</P>

<P>Selling, administrative and research (SAR) costs remained essentially
flat during the quarter. We've said since 1993 we would keep below-the-line
costs flat -- and we've done it. We also intend to hold them steady in 1997.
Obviously we can't keep the lid on SAR spending forever, but we can keep
below-the-line costs growing at rates lower than inflation, and we intend
to do so.</P>

<P>Raw material costs were down 10 percent for the quarter, compared to
year-ago levels, and down slightly from the second quarter of this year.
While the raw material cost decline was helpful, selling prices also were
down 2 percent. As a result, we've seen an improvement in our overall selling
price/raw material cost relationship, but we have not yet regained the balance
we enjoyed before raw material prices skyrocketed in 1994.</P>

<P>We completed the repurchase of 3.5 million shares of our common stock
in September. We continue to have strong cash flow and our debt-to-equity
ratio was below 40 percent. Because of our strong cash position, the board
of directors approved a second buyback program of another 3.5 million shares
in mid-October.</P>

<P>The outlook for the remainder of 1996 is positive, though the fourth
quarter comparison with last year will not be as favorable as it was for
the third quarter. Our overall performance was quite strong in the fourth
quarter of 1995, compared with a weak performance in the third quarter of
last year.</P>

<P><B>THIRD QUARTER 1996 versus THIRD QUARTER 1995</B></P>

<P>Third quarter 1996 earnings were $87 million, up 47% from last year's
results of $59 million. Earnings per common share increased 54% to $1.31
from $.85 in 1995. All regions and businesses, except Electronic Chemicals,
had volume growth which resulted in an 8% increase in volume for the quarter.
Sales of $969 million were 3% above the prior-year period due to higher
volume, offset by a 17% weaker Japanese yen, 2% weaker European currencies,
a lower-priced product mix and 2% lower selling prices. Earnings increased
as a result of increased sales, 10% lower raw material prices, smooth plant
operations and flat selling, administrative and research costs.</P>

<P>Polymers, Resins and Monomers (PRM) earnings of $72 million jumped 67%
compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of the Petroleum Chemicals
reclassification (see Liquidity section), sales grew 9% and volume rose
10%. All regions and businesses contributed to the volume growth. Positive
impacts on earnings included increased volume, lower raw material prices
and smooth plant operations. Lower selling prices hurt earnings in the quarter.</P>

<P>Performance Chemicals reported earnings of $20 million, up 18% from last
year's earnings of $17 million. Sales were up 1%, though volume declined
2%, due to a higher-priced product mix. Ion Exchange Resins reported profits
again this quarter, compared to a loss in the prior-year quarter. Shipley
Company had lower volume and earnings, reflecting sluggishness in the electronics
industry, the weakness of the Japanese yen and accruals for restructuring
costs in Europe.</P>

<P>Plastics recorded earnings of $14 million, up $1 million from the 1995
period. Volume was up 20% because additives used in PVC applications had
double-digit volume growth in all regions and AtoHaas Americas had significant
volume gains in North America. Plastics sales were up 8% because of higher
volume, offset by lower selling prices and weaker European currencies. Plastics
earnings benefited from declining raw material prices. Earnings growth was
restrained by losses from AtoHaas Europe, due to weak market conditions
manifested by lower volume, falling selling prices and higher raw material
costs.</P>

<P>Agricultural Chemicals earnings of $2 million were $1 million less than
the prior-year period. Sales decreased 1%, though volume grew 16%, due to
a lower-priced product mix and weaker currencies in Europe and Japan. The
volume gains were due to a significant increase of shipments of Dithane
in all regions except North America. Earnings declined due to reduced sales
of Mimic insecticide because the caterpillar infestation that hit the United
States in 1995 did not reoccur this year. There also was higher selling,
administrative and research expense to support new product introductions.</P>

<P>The company's gross profit margin for the third quarter was 36%, compared
to 33% last year. The increase resulted from 8% volume growth, 10% percent
lower raw material prices, smooth plant operations and higher production
volumes.</P>

<P>Interest expense increased $1 million due to lower capitalization of
interest cost as part of construction in progress. Affiliate losses were
$1 million compared to earnings of $1 million in the third quarter of 1995
due to losses from AtoHaas Europe which has seen intense competition in
the acrylic plastics business. Other expense, net, was $3 million, down
from $12 million in 1995, due to higher royalty income and gains from foreign
currency translations.</P>

      <H3>NINE MONTHS 1996 VERSUS NINE MONTHS 1995</H3>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Earnings for the first nine months of 1996 were $288 million, a 28% increase
over last year's earnings of $225 million. Earnings per common share were
$4.28, up 32% compared with the 1995 period. The 1996 earnings were increased
by a $10 million retroactive tax credit on sales outside of the United States.
The 1995 results were reduced by a $17 million after-tax charge for additional
potential liability related to the cleanup of the Whitmoyer waste site.
Absent these items, earnings would have increased 15%. Sales increased 2%
to $3,017 million due to 3% higher volume. Selling prices were essentially
flat with last year. Earnings were helped by 8% lower raw material prices
and volume growth.</P>

<P>Polymers, Resins and Monomers earnings of $180 million were up 29% from
1995. Sales and volume grew 5%, excluding the impact of the Petroleum Chemicals
business. Architectural Coatings reported higher volume in North America
and Latin America and Construction Products had volume gains in all regions.
Earnings growth resulted from lower raw material prices and increased volume,
partly offset by an increase in unit manufacturing costs, lower selling
prices and higher selling, administrative and research costs.</P>

<P>Performance Chemicals earnings increased 19% to $64 million, from $54
million last year. Sales were up 4%, excluding the sale of a small electronic
chemicals subsidiary in 1995, and volume increased 2%. Shipley Company's
sales were up, but growth slowed due to weakening of the electronics industry.
Biocides had lower sales, despite higher volume, reflecting weakening currencies
in Europe and Japan and lower selling prices. Ion Exchange Resins reported
earnings in 1996 compared to losses in 1995 due to operating costs which
were below last year.</P>

<P>Plastics recorded earnings of $41 million, down from $53 million in 1995.
Sales declined slightly, despite 3% higher volume, reflecting lower selling
prices. Plastics Additives reported higher volume, but declining selling
prices and weakening currencies in Europe and Japan resulted in lower sales
and flat earnings. AtoHaas Americas had lower volume and higher manufacturing
costs which were only partially offset by lower raw material prices. Earnings
were hurt by significant losses from AtoHaas Europe due to weak market conditions
in the acrylic plastics business.</P>

<P>Agricultural Chemicals earnings were $42 million, $2 million less than
the first nine months of 1995. Sales were up 2%, due to 6% higher volume
and a lower-priced product mix. The volume gain is due to increased shipments
of Dithane in all regions, except North America. Earnings declined due toreduced
sales of Mimic insecticide because the caterpillar infestationin the United
States in 1995 did not reoccur this year. Earnings werealso dampened by
higher selling, administrative and research expense to support development
and introduction of new products.</P>

<P>Corporate expenses were $39 million, compared to $66 million in 1995.
The 1995 period included an after-tax charge of $17 million for additional
potential liability related to the cleanup of the Whitmoyer waste site.
Other reasons for lower expense in 1996 included lower interest expense
and a $10 million retroactive tax credit on sales outside of the U.S. The
company's gross profit margin for the first nine months was 36%, compared
to 34% in 1995. Margins improved due to 8% lower raw material prices, higher
production volumes and smooth plant operations.</P>

<P>Selling, administrative and research expenses were up 2%, compared to
1995, to support business growth. Interest expense of $29 million was $2
million lower than 1995 because of lower interest rates. Affiliate losses
were $9 million, compared to earnings of $6 million reported last year,
due to losses from AtoHaas Europe, the result of weak market conditions.
Other expense, net, was $6 million, compared to $48 million last year. The
prior year included a $26 million charge for additional potential liability
related to the Whitmoyer waste site and $4 million for the settlement of
litigation. The current year includes higher royalty income and gains from
foreign currency translations.</P>

<P>The effective tax rate for the first nine months was 32%, down from 34%
for the first nine months of 1995. The current year includes a $10 million
retroactive tax credit on sales outside of the United States.</P>

<P>At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents totaled $50 million,
up $7 million from the 1995 year-end balance. Accounts receivable were up
$56 million during the first nine months, reflecting a normal seasonal pattern.
In early 1996, the company collected $24 million of insurance recoveries
related to environmental remediation cost claims.</P>

<P>The debt-to-equity ratio, calculated without the reduction to stockholders'
equity for the ESOP transaction, was 39% at the end of September, compared
with 36% at year-end 1995. Total debt increased $45 million since year-end.
The increase in the debt-to-equity ratio was mainly due to the reduction
in equity resulting from the company's stock repurchase program, which was
completed in September. During this time, the company purchased 3.5 million
shares of its common stock at a cost of $229 million. On October 18, 1996,
the board of directors approved a second stock buy-back program of another
3.5 million shares.</P>

<P>Fixed asset additions during the first nine months of 1996 totaled $218
million. Spending for the full year is estimated to be in the range of $350
million and includes expenditures for new emulsion facilities in Thailand,
Indonesia and Houston, Texas, andcapacity expansion for acrylic acid at
Houston, Texas.</P>

<P>On October 18, 1996, the board of directors declared regular quarterly
dividends of $.45 per common share and $.6875 per preferred share. Both
dividends are payable December 1, 1996, to stockholders of record on November
8, 1996.</P>

<P>During the quarter, the company completed the formation of RohMax, a
50-50 joint venture with Rohm GmbH for the research, manufacture and sale
of petroleum additives. Effective July 3, 1996, the company's share of RohMax's
earnings were reported as equity in affiliates. RohMax is expected to have
annual sales of approximately $225 million, which will not be included in
the consolidated sales of Rohm and Haas. However, the company will supply
certain raw materials to the joint venture. On an annualized basis, the
net impact is a reduction of $100 million in the company's sales, with an
immaterial impact on earnings. The raw materials will be supplied by PRM,
so for reporting purposes, the company has moved the results of the Petroleum
Chemicals business from Performance Chemicals to PRM. The table below shows
sales and earnings for the past six quarters restated for this change.</P>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">(a)</TD>
<TD>These interim financial statements are unaudited, but, in theopinion of
management, all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, have
been made to present fairly the company's financial position, results of
operations and cash flows. It is suggested that these financial statements
be read in conjunction with the financial statements, accounting policies
and the notes included in the company's annual report for the year ended
December 31, 1995.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">(b)</TD>
<TD>The company is a party in various government enforcement and private actions
associated with former waste disposal sites. The company is also involved
in potential corrective actions at some of it manufacturing facilities.
The amounts charged to earnings before tax for environmental remediation
were $19 million and $32 million for the nine months ended September 30,
1996 and 1995, respectively. The charge in the 1995 period includes additional
accruals in the first quarter related to the Whitmoyer waste site. At September
30, 1996, the reserves for remediation were $151 million and probable insurance
recoveries were $48 million.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD></TD>
<TD>In addition to accrued environmental liabilities, the company has reasonably
possible loss contingencies relating to environmental matters of approximately
$65 million. The company has also identified other sites where future environmental
remediation expenditures may be required, but these expenditures are not
reasonably estimable at this time. The company believes that these matters,
when ultimately resolved, which may be over the next decade, will not have
a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the
company, but could have a material adverse effect on consolidated results
of operations in any given year.</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">(c)</TD>
<TD>The company and its subsidiaries are parties to litigation arising out of
the ordinary conduct of its business. Recognizing the amounts reserved for
such items and the uncertainty of the outcome, it is the company's opinion
that the resolution of all pending lawsuits and claims will not have a material
adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, upon the results of operations
and the consolidated financial position of the company.</TD></TR>

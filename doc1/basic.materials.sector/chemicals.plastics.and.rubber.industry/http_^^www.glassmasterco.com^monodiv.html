<FONT SIZE=-1>The success of Glassmaster Monofilament can be traced directly to our total dedication to Research and Development.  We are continually searching for, testing and exploring new products and improving existing ones for the highly specialized needs of our customers.  It is a never ending process, one we approach with the simple goal of discovering a better product and how to produce it at a better price.<P>
Our commitment to R&D requires close partnerships with chemical companies.  Specialty polymers are brought in on a regular basis, extruded and tested under a complete confidentiality basis.  It also means working in concert with customers.  Since we extrude mainly specialty monofilaments, we invite requests for new and unusual applications.  To Glassmaster, opportunity lies in the unknown.<P>
Glassmaster assures consistency with every order -- a consistently superior product, consistent personal service and a consistently competitive price.  Our customers rely on our ability to perform and we do, time and again.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=-1>Some manufacturers oversell and their customers suffer.  By staying within our capacity and capabilites, we are seldom caught short and can always supply what we commit.  To meet the demands for just-in-time deliveries, additional capacity was recently added to our plant.  Plans for future expansion will be put into action as business expands.<P>
From product development to manufacturing to delivery, you can rely on Glassmaster Monofilament Division.  Mastering opportunities... for customers like you.<P>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><strong><b>Rogers Introduces
Liquid Photoimageable Solder Mask for <br>
Flexible Circuit Boards</b></strong></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong><b><i>-- Allows
Fabrication of Flexible Circuits with Fine Patterns --</i></b></strong></font></p>

<p>Rogers, CT, September 23, 1997: Rogers Corporation introduces
R/flex® 8080LP liquid photoimageable covercoats, a line of
materials that are ideal for flexible circuit applications where
fine pattern resolution, moisture resistance, and creasability
are important. The demand for rugged flexible circuits with finer
lines and higher densities is growing, particularly for hard disk
drive, automotive underhood, and chip packaging applications. The
combination of an R/flex 8080LP covercoat and an R/flex high
performance flexible circuit material can produce a high
resolution flexible circuit that withstands rigorous
environments. The new covercoat offers a savings over
conventional coverfilms.</p>

<p>Rogers is extending its ability to serve customers who need
specialized material technology, along with high performance
laminates, to serve their markets. The R/flex 8080LP
photoimageable covercoats have been used by major electronics
companies in Japan for several years, where they are sold as
NPR-80 products by the Nippon Polytech Corporation of Tokyo.
Rogers is the exclusive distributor for these covercoats in the
U.S., and has additional distribution rights for Europe. </p>

<p>Rogers liquid photoimageable covercoats can be easily
processed using conventional methods and process chemistries,
including screening, spray coating, curtain coating, and
photoimaging. The new covercoats are alkaline developable solder
resists. With proper exposure, development, and cure, the
covercoats allow the direct imaging of very precise patterns for
fineline circuits.</p>

<p>The R/flex 8080LP3 formulation meets the chemical
compatibility requirements of the hard disk drive industry. All
of the new R/flex 8080LP covercoat products are resistant to
plating chemistries, including for electroless Ni and Au plating,
and have excellent process stability, with outstanding adhesion
and heat resistance. The products also have a long shelf and pot
life, and good electrical insulation properties. Data related to
these properties, and to viscosity, physical properties of the
film, plating resistance, curing temperature and time, resolution
and photosensitivity, electrical resistance, and other test
results, are available from Rogers.</p>

<p>Rogers manufactures specialty materials, including laminates
for flexible, microwave, and high frequency printed circuits.
Headquartered in Rogers, CT, U.S.A., Rogers business locations
include Connecticut, Arizona, Illinois, Belgium, Japan, and Hong
Kong. </p>

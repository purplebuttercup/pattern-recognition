<hr>

Advanced Circuitry's mission is to be the recognized
leader in the manufacture of complex printed circuit 
boards by providing superior value and service.
<br><br>

<b><font color="#0000ff" font SIZE=+2>Overview</font></b><br>
<hr>

Advanced Circuitry has 35+ years experience as a leading supplier
of medium-to-high volume multilayer and high performance backpanel
printed circuit boards to the world's leaders in communications, high
speed computing, storage, network management, and test/measurement.
<br><br>

Our engineering expertise places us in the forefront with emerging
technologies like fibre channel, RF, ATM, and high speed SCSI.  We
consistently manufacture large, thick, complex, impedance controlled
multilayers on a volume production basis.  We build single-ended, 
differential and broadside impedance boards, with single-ended and 
differential impedance on the same layer.
<br><br>

We are prepared to meet the industry's most stringent demands with 
proven capabilities including panel sizes up to 27" x 44" and 30" x
42", internal copper up to four ounces, low Dk high Tg laminate, layer
counts up to 32, sequential lamination, and advanced test.
<br><br>

Advanced Circuitry's high reliability, high technology multilayers and 
backplanes are build to Bellcore standards in our ISO 9002 registered
facility.  We have an industry-wide reputation for our statistical process
control system which supports this world class focus.  Our comprehensive
reliability lab is the best in class for establishing the most robust 
manufacturing processes and failure analysis.

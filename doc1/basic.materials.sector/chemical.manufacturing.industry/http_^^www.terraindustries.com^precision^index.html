<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Precision agriculture</B> is usually associated with technology.
At Terra, we define Precision In AgricultureTM as one of the ways to become
more successful on the farm. It's knowing what tools to use and how to
use the information the tools generate. The information, or data, lets
you see and better understand the variability in every section of your
fields. That data gives you the power to understand and make management
decisions to influence those variables.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Precision agriculture</B> could also be called site-specific farming
because the data you collect allows you to see what's occurring in smaller
sections of your field. With that kind of information, and the ability
to see and then influence the variations in your fields, you can make adjustments
that benefit you agronomically, economically and environmentally. You can
start by learning the current industry terms and working with Terra to
understand and use new technology. <BR>

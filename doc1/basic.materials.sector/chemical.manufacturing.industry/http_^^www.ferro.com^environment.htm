        growing worldwide concern for the environment as an
        opportunity to develop better products, to continuously
        improve the responsible management of chemicals and to
        participate in chemical industry efforts to address
        public concerns. </strong><p><strong>Environmental
        considerations are a driving force behind the evolution
        of products and the identification of additional niche
        opportunities by each of the business segments. Examples
        include the development of lead- and cadmium-free color
        pigments and of fuel additives that reduce automotive
        emissions, the growing popularity of solvent-free powder
        coatings and of recyclable polypropylene compounds, and
        much more. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ferro has invested heavily in upgrading
        facilities to meet regulatory standards, increase
        efficiency, minimize and reuse wastes and enhance the
        recyclability of products. Since 1985, for example, the
        Company has conducted regular audits to ensure that all
        plants comply with exacting environmental, health and
        safety standards. Ferro also implemented a program in
        1988 to minimize wastes that has led to a substantial
        decline in pounds of waste per pounds of product. The
        Company participates in and already exceeds the goals of
        the U.S. EPA's voluntary 33/50 Program. This program
        calls for a 50 percent reduction in the environmental
        releases of 17 specific chemicals by 1995. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>In addition, virtually all bulk storage tanks
        have been moved above ground or eliminated. Recently
        installed biological waste water treatment plants at the
        Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Bedford, Ohio, facilities
        ensure that waste water effluent meets regulatory
        requirements for discharge. Ferro is also committed to
        installing state-of-the-art systems to reduce volatile
        emissions at its manufacturing facilities. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>The Company has developmental programs under
        way to enhance the recyclability of polypropylene
        products, and the polypropylene compounding business is
        utilizing greater quantities of recycled plastics. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ferro participates in the Chemical
        Manufacturers Association's Responsible Care program, a
        broad chemical industry commitment to improve
        environmental and safety performance through a process
        the ensures responsivenss to the public's concerns. As
        part of the program, Ferro has been implementing
        management practices that address process safety,
        pollution prevention, employee health and safety,
        distribution, community awareness, emergency response and
        product stewardship. </strong></p>

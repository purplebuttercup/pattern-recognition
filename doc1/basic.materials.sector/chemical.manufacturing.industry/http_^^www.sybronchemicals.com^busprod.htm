<p align="center"><strong>Sybron Chemicals Inc. is the sum of its
specialty chemical businesses. <br>
Each is built on a market-oriented team.</strong></p>

<p>Our component businesses operate with an entrepreneurial
spirit, always staying close to the customers while focusing on
product development, applications, marketing, and sales.</p>

<p>Our people understand their customers' unique needs and are
able to respond quickly to changing market demands. For example,
we are meeting today's challenges with our advancements in
industrial waste treatment, groundspill remediation, and products
and methods to produce pure water.</p>

<p>Our manufacturing capabilities encompass a broad range of
techniques, from basic mixing and blending to fermentation and
sophisticated reaction chemistry. Our varied end-user industries
include electronics, utilities, oil refining, textile dyeing and
finishing, municipalities, pharmaceuticals, steel, chemicals, and
automobile manufacturing.</p>

<p>Our activities fall into two general business areas:</p>

<p>The Company's environmental products and services and related
materials consist of water treatment products, biochemicals and
specialty polymers:</p>

<p><img src="images/busprod1.gif" width="238" height="36"><br>
Ionac® resins play a major role in providing pure water for
industrial and domestic use worldwide. They also are becoming
increasingly important in selective metal recovery and <a

<p><img src="images/busprod3.gif" width="163" height="38"><br>
Our specially adapted bacteria are finding increasing use as the
active components in consumer and institutional sanitary
products, such as the new line of drain build-up removers. Also,
we are developing and using these bacteria to degrade chemical
wastes generated by industry. A further extension of this knowhow
is being utilized to clean up soil that has been contaminated by
oil and chemical leaks and spills.</p>

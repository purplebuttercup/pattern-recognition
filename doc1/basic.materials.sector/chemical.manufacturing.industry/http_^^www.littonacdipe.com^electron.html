<hr>
Electronic Systems Packaging (ESP)'s mission is to establish Litton as an early involved and 
preferred strategic supplier of high speed systems and, by its
product offerings, become the supplier of choice.
<br><br>

<font size=+2 color="#0000ff">Overview</font><br>
<hr>
Electronic Systems Packaging (ESP) is the focused technical sales and
marketing service of Litton's Advanced Circuitry, Inter-Pak Electronics,
<a href="http://www.litton-wed.com">Winchester Electronics</a> and Interconnect Products-UK.
<br><br>

ESP capitalizes on the collective strengths of our divisions to bring our
customers the most reliable, cost effective printed circuit boards, custom
backpanels, and enhanced interconnect system packaging in the industry.
<br><br>

Litton is the early involvement supplier to the world's leaders in communications,
high speed computing, storage, network management, and the test/measurement
markets.  We focus on supporting the leading and emerging technologies in each
of these markets -- including landmark work in fibre channel, switching, 
networking, and wireless technologies.
<br><br>

Electronic Systems Packaging offers simulation, modeling and verification, 
advanced signal analysis and testing, and competitive interconnect solutions
for a balanced system package.  With the recognized technical expertise of 
our applications engineers, we consistently demonstrate a shortened critical
path in time to market and time to volume.
<br><br>

ESP's commitment to partnership with our customers has a significant impact
on the engineering organizations of our valued customers.  Collaborative 
engineering reduces development time, provides manufacturable designs, and
through our advanced testing methods, measures actual product to provide
simulation and modeling verification.  Collaborative engineering provides
our customers with the competitive edge of time to market by predicting the
systems performance before layout begins.  Verification testing of the signal
integrity, digital and analog, provides a design that is right the first 
time, every time.

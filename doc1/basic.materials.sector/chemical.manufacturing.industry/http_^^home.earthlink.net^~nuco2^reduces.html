<p>Bulk CO2 systems reduce operating costs by eliminating the need for the customer to provide manpower to manage and keep track of cylinders, be available to receive deliveries and install new cylinders as gas is consumed.  Gas usage is reduced since, unlike cylinders, where invariably gas is lost when less-than-empty cylinders are changed based on perceived weight, bulk CO2 vessels serve as constant reservoirs which are refilled according to a contents gauge.  The company estimated that users of bulk CO2 systems will generally experience savings from less fountain beverage product waste.</p>

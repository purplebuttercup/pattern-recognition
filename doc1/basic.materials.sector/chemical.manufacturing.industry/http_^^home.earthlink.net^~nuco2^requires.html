<p>Bulk CO2 vessels are plumbed to the outside of the customer's place of business for 24-hour, seven day a week service.  Therefore, the system can be refilled from a specialized bulk CO2 delivery truck without the assistance of customer personnel and during peak and non-business hours.  This eliminates the need to remove or transport high pressure cylinders and avoids the wear and hazards associated with such handling.  With high pressure cylinders, the user experiences downtime when cylinders are replaced, which often occurs without prior warning and may result in lost carbonated beverage sales.  Bulk CO2 systems have no downtime during refilling since the refill process does not interrupt the flow of CO2 to drink machines.  A continuous flow of CO2 is critical to customers since carbonated beverages represent a highly profitable item. </p>

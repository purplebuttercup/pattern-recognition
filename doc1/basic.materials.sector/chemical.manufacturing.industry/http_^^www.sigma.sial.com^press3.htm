<strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;				<strong>August 20, 1997</strong><p><p><br>



Sigma-Aldrich Corporation announced today the pending acquisition of Carbolabs Inc., Bethany, Connecticut. <p>

Carbolabs manufactures an extensive line of organic isocyanates, amines and chloroformates which supplement the fine organic chemicals marketed by Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc., a member of the Sigma-Aldrich family of companies. Aldrich currently sources a number of catalog products from Carbolabs. Eventually, the Carbolabs catalog business will be completely integrated into the Aldrich Brand. The current Carbolabs catalog lists about 500 products while over 30,000 chemical products are offered by Aldrich.<p> 

Dr. Philip M. Pivawer, present owner and President of Carbolabs, will remain with and continue to run the operation in Bethany. The company will continue to concentrate in its core area of business, the manufacture of isocyanates and phosgene derivatives on a laboratory scale, but will also carry out custom synthesis in other areas. The planned close affiliation with Aldrich will allow for the transfer of Carbolabs' technology to Aldrich's larger scale manufacturing operations. This will enable Carbolabs to better serve their customers as a project moves from development to commercial scale. <p>

The transaction is expected to be finalized by the end of August. The price paid by Sigma-Aldrich for the stock of Carbolabs is not being announced. <p>

Sigma-Aldrich, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, develops, manufactures and distributes a broad range of high quality chemicals for use in research and development, the diagnosis of disease, and as specialty chemicals for manufacturing purposes. Its Aldrich subsidiary, headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, manufactures and markets an extensive line of organics and inorganics for chemical synthesis. <p>

        <p align="left"><strong>While some corporations have only
        recently discovered the advantages of international
        presence and expertise, global operations have been a way
        of life for Ferro since the early days of the Company.
        For many years, international operations have been the
        source of more than half of both sales and profits. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ferro's early years brought corporate growth
        primarily in Europe, followed by Latin America and then
        other areas of the globe. While the Company continually
        evaluates expansion opportunities worldwide, current
        activity has been centered on the major growth economies
        of the countries comprising the Association of Southeast
        Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other areas of the Far East. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ferro today maintains operations in 22
        countries - and has been associated with 13 of those
        countries for at least 25 years, and seven of those for
        more than half a century. All told, the Company serves
        the specialty material product needs of diversified
        industrial customers in over 100 nations. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Throughout the world, quality products and
        customer service are Ferro's hallmarks. Particular
        emphasis is placed on obtaining and maintaining
        International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9000
        quality certification for every operation. Most
        businesses achieved certification by the end of 1993,
        with several scheduled for certification in 1994. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ferro and its customers benefit from the broad
        international operating experience of the Company's
        executive management team, many of whom have years of
        firsthand management experience at one or more of Ferro's
        foreign subsidiaries. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ferro's international management approach is
        dynamic and responsive, and as conditions change, so does
        the Company. For example, each Ferro subsidiary or
        foreign operation traditionally was managed by a managing
        director resident in an individual country. To better
        capitalize on the integrated markets in Europe, Ferro
        adopted a pan-European organization in 1992. In addition,
        the Company has named global managers for major product
        lines. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ferro's global presence is a strong
        competitive advantage. Ferro's technical, marketing and
        management personnel are in continuous contact with
        customers in every major area of the world. Multinational
        customers can be assured of standard products and
        consistent quality wherever they have operations. Ferro
        also benefits from volume purchasing of key raw materials
        on a worldwide basis and from the cost-effective
        implementation of best practice product development,
        production and customer service approaches in its
        facilities worldwide. </strong></p>

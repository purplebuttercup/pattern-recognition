<FONT SIZE=+2>What Differentiates Terra? </FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI>Terra emphasizes profit per acre rather than price per unit with grower
  customers. Our recommendation system builds cost-effective soil fertility,
  crop protection and seed programs for the customer. Over time, the grower
  will have a valuable history to better manage his business.<BR>
  <BR>
  
  <LI>We have an extensively trained sales force, using our own state-of-the-art
  Terra University curricula; regional agronomists to back them up; and a
  research farm to test products under field conditions. This means customers
  can count on Terra for the information they need.<BR>
  <BR>
  
  <LI>Terra takes its environmental responsibility seriously with a full-time
  staff of safety and environmental specialists who audit every Terra facility
  annually. These Terra experts provide community, regulatory and legislative
  assistance, and safety training for employees and customers.<BR>
  <BR>
  
  <LI>Terra has also made a commitment to <A HREF="http://www.terraindustries.com/precision/index.html">Precision
  Agriculture</A>: The use of geo-referenced data to maximize the return
  from crop inputs.

<FONT SIZE=+2>Revenue Growth Strategies</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI>Opportunistic acquisition of fertilizer production capacity will increase
  Terra's nitrogen products revenue base.<BR>
  <BR>
  
  <LI>Terra is using existing assets to serve new markets, such as the turf,
  nursery and vegetation management markets.<BR>
  <BR>
  
  <LI>Terra plans to acquire additional farm service centers, expanding the
  network and revenue base and capitalizing on the consolidation trend in
  agricultural distribution.

<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>Margin Growth Strategies </FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI>Expanded nitrogen solution production in our <A HREF="http://www.terraindustries.com/fertilizer/plants/portneal.html">Port
  Neal, Iowa plant</A> will enable increased sales of this upgraded product
  in place of lower margin anhydrous ammonia.<BR>
  <BR>
  
  <LI>Our product mix goals move sales increasingly to higher margin products,
  such as our Riverside&reg; chemicals and Terra seed.<BR>
  <BR>
  
  <LI>Terra aims to control costs; SG&amp;A as a percent of sales has decreased
  steadily over the last few years.<BR>
  <BR>
  
  <LI>By making distribution acquisitions in geography we currently serve,
  we spread overhead costs while serving an expanded distribution customer
  base.

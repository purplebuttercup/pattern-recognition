<p>Bulk CO2 systems store liquid CO2 at 150 to 200 lbs. per square inch (&quot;psi&quot;) of pressure versus the 800 to 1,000 psi of pressure required in high pressure cylinders.  Since the risk of explosion inherent in high pressure cylinders is substantially eliminated, the conversion to bulk CO2 generally results in lower insurance and worker's compensation rates for customers.  In addition, employee handling of heavy steel cylinders is eliminated with the installation of stationary bulk CO2 systems.</p>

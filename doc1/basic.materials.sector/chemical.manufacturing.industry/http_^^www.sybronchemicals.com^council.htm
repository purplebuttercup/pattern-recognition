<h2 align="center"><a name="CHARTER">CHARTER</a> </h2>

<h2 align="center">Statement of Purpose </h2>

<p>To achieve better, more effective and continuing two-way
communications between Sybron Chemicals Inc. and its neighbors, a
cooperative effort will be undertaken to establish an advisory
group called the Neighborhood Involvement Council (NIC). </p>

<p>The Council will provide neighbors and the company with an
ongoing forum to discuss, evaluate and resolve activities, plans,
programs and concerns of mutual interest. </p>

<h3><em>Guidelines</em> </h3>

<p>1. The mandate of NIC is to promote productive and positive
communications between Sybron Chemicals and its neighbors. </p>

<p>2. The NIC will serve as an advisory group, with the right to
make recommendations or requests to Sybron. These will be
reviewed and responded to promptly by Sybron. While highly
valuable, NIC actions and recommendations are advisory in nature
and not binding on Sybron. Nevertheless, the NIC may, if it
differs with the company's response on any recommendation,
resubmit that recommendation directly to the CEO of Sybron for
his consideration and response. </p>

<h3 align="left"><em><strong>Membership</strong></em> </h3>

<p>1. The NIC is a voluntary organization, composed of no less
than five nor more than fifteen area residents, a non-voting
representative of Sybron, and up to three non-voting, ex-officio
members. (Area residents are primarily those who are PINS
subscribers, and live within 2 miles of the Sybron facility.) </p>

<p>2. All area residents who volunteer will participate in the
NIC. If more than fifteen members express an interest in
participating, a Steering Committee of seven shall be elected by
all members of the NIC. At the first organizational meeting, the
NIC will elect a Chairman and Vice-Chairman to preside over the
meetings (one-year terms). The chairman will be the primary
spokesperson for NIC, schedule all meetings and organize
subcommittees on task forces as needed. All business of the NIC
will be conducted on a consensus basis, with voting based on a
simple majority. The chairman will not vote, but will break all
ties. </p>

<p>3. Sybron will provide a non-voting member to serve NIC as a
secretary, company liaison and to provide housekeeping support.
SCI will make meeting facilities available. </p>

<p>4. The LEPC, PTEC, and Community News will each be allowed to
add one non-voting ex-officio member to the NIC, </p>

<h3 align="left"><em><strong>Issues </strong></em></h3>

<p>1. Issues may be raised by Sybron or the NIC, for
consideration by the NIC. Initial issues might include odor
abatement projects, the Sybron &quot;ballfield,&quot; health
fairs, operations of PINS, etc. </p>

<h3><em>Funding </em></h3>

<p>1. Sybron will seriously consider all requests from NIC for
financial support, recognizing that the activities of NIC will
involve some expenses. </p>

<p>2. Sybron will assume the costs incurred in organizing and
conducting local meetings. Funding requests for other activities,
such as printing, mailings and notices, will be reviewed on a
case by case basis. </p>

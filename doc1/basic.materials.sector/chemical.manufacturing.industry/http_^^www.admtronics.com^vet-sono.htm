<P>Equi-Tech Therapy uses the most advanced technology for treating joint
problems in horses.  This technology was proven to reduce lameness and increase
range of motion for horses in controlled laboratory studies.  The therapy has no
harmful side effects and it is non-invasive and does not cause pain to the
horses.  It is the safe, efficient way to reduce lameness and improve the
condition of horses with joint problems.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Laboratory Tested</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>Extensive double-blind laboratory studies were conducted on ponies with
induced arthritis at the University of Wisconsin Veterinary School.  The results
of the studies showed that the technology used by Equi-Tech Therapy reduced the
level of joint problems in the horses and increased their range of motion. 
Swelling was reduced and gait analysis revealed a marked improvement in range of
motion. The results of this study were published in the well respected Canadian
Journal of Veterinary Research in early 1991.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Results at the Track</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>Horses treated with Equi-Tech Therapy have and will perform better.  As an
example, Wajastar, a 3 year old was diagnosed as having degenerative joint
disease syndrome or osteoarthritis in the left rear hock with some secondary
sensitivity in the back.  This was determined by experts at the University of
Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, New Bolton Center on June 3, 1991. 
A Professor of Sports Medicine at the center recommended 3 to 4 months of rest
before resuming racing.  Equi-Tech Therapy was started on Wajastar on July 15,
1991. After three treatments he resumed racing. On 7/31/91 Wajastar finished
2nd.  On 8/8/91 he finished 4th.  On 8/17/91 he finished 2nd losing by a head
and running one of the fastest times of his career. His owner and trainer report
that not only is he racing well but all signs of the lameness have disappeared.
These are results you can expect from Equi-Tech Therapy.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>How Does It Work?</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>Equi-Tech Therapy uses a device which employs Pulsed Radio Frequency Therapy
or PRFT.  This is a device which produces a safe corona discharge beam of PRFT
which is administered to the affected joint for a certain period of time over
several treatment visits.  PRFT has no harmful side effects but has been proven
to reduce lameness and pain in inflamed joints.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>The Treatment Regimen</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>Once a horse is determined to have a joint related problem, Equi-Tech
Therapy should be commenced.  The standard treatment regimen recommended entails
3 to 4 treatment visits over a 2 to 4 weeks period with treatment visits a
minimum of 4 days apart.  At each visit the horse will have a series of PRFT.
administrations to the joint which can be performed in the stall or other
convenient location.  After treatment, the horse is walked for 3 to 5 minutes. 
The entire treatment visit takes approximately 20 to 40 minutes.  Other than
this simple procedure, there is no special handling required and no change in
training necessary. Results should be observed after the first or second visit
and maximum effect realized after the third or fourth. Thereafter, it is
advisable to treat again 2 to 3 days prior to each race for maintenance.</P>

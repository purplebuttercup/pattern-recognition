Textile specialty chemicals business segments of Ivax Industries,
a subsidiary of Ivax Corporation. Revenues of the acquired
businesses for the latest twelve months were in the range of $19

cash, subject to post-closing adjustments. </p>

<p>Sybron expects this acquisition will be accretive to earnings
in the first year. The assets acquired do not include the Ivax
manufacturing facility in Rock Hill, SC. After a brief
transitionary period, Sybron Chemicals will manufacture the
products currently being produced by Ivax in Sybron's own
facilities. Approximately 25 professional people from Ivax,
including top management of these segments and key sales,
marketing, R&amp;D and international personnel, have joined
Sybron Chemicals. </p>

<p>The existing garment processing business of Sybron Chemicals
is being merged in with the Ivax business, with Bob Allen,
formerly of Ivax, having worldwide profit responsibility.
Included are the Ivax formulated products and definitive patents
for the use of enzymes to achieve a &quot;stone-washed&quot;
effect on denim and other cotton leisure wear. Ivax textile
chemical business and personnel are being combined with Sybron's
substantially larger business for preparation, dyeing, printing
and finishing of textiles. </p>

<p>Dr. Richard M. Klein, President and CEO of Sybron Chemicals,
said, &quot;We are very excited about this transaction that fits
with our strategy of acquiring selected niche-businesses to
enhance our position as a leading supplier of high-performance
specialties to the textile industry worldwide. We have acquired
the premier business in the fast-growing field of chemical
specialties for garment processing. It has major strengths in
technology and in its organization that provide great synergies
with our existing business activities, our worldwide
infrastructure and our objectives to grow in developing areas,
which is where more and more garment processing is taking place.
Overall, we believe this combination will enable us to serve the
industry better with a broader product line and enhanced
capabilities to meet current and future needs.&quot; </p>

  <H2>W.H. Brady Co. reports record first quarter sales and earnings</H2>

     MILWAUKEE (November 14, 1997)--W.H. Brady Co. (Nasdaq: BRCOA)
     today announced record sales and earnings for its fiscal 1998
     first quarter.
<P>
        Sales for the quarter ending October 31, 1997, were $115.3
     million, up 18.6 percent from sales of $97.2 million in the
     fiscal 1997 first quarter. Sales growth was especially strong in
     international markets, including Europe and the Asia/Pacific
     region.
<P>
        Operating income in the fiscal 1998 first quarter was $13.1
     million, an increase of 24 percent over the 1997 first quarter.
     Net income was $8.2 million or $0.37 per share, up 25.7 percent
     from the $6.5 million or $0.30 per share in the quarter last
     year.
   <P>     "We had a strong quarter throughout our operating groups,
     aided in part by recovery in European markets, new product
     introductions and three additional working days in the quarter
     compared to the quarter last year,"said Katherine M. Hudson,
     president and chief executive officer."We also saw bottom line
     benefits from the restructuring we undertook in Europe and the
     United States in 1997.
       <P> "In 1998, we will continue our efforts in cost control and
     resource utilization while investing in growth opportunities. We
     will invest in research and development and global information
     technology, which will support our ability to provide
     identification and materials solutions to customers around the
     world. We also seek to make acquisitions that will strengthen the
     company's geographic, market or technological
     reach while enhancing shareholder value."
   <P>     W.H. Brady Co. is an international manufacturer of industrial
     identification, safety, graphics and precision tape products. It
     markets more than 30,000 products including high-performance

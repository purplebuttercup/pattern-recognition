Sigma-Aldrich Laboratory Chemicals Partnership</strong></font></center>

<p>
	<strong>SEELZE, Germany, May 28, 1997  --- AlliedSignal Inc.  and Sigma-Aldrich Corporation announced today that they received formal clearance from the Federal Cartel Office of Germany for Sigma-Aldrich’s acquisition of an interest in a new partnership, RdH Laborchemikaliem GmbH & Co., KG.  
<p>
	Under the planned acquisition, the laboratory chemicals business of AlliedSignal Specialty Chemicals’ Riedel-de Ha&euml;n unit, based in Seelze near Hannover, will be operated as a partnership, with 75% ownership by Sigma-Aldrich and 25% by Riedel-de Ha&euml;n.  
<p>
	The Riedel-de Ha&euml;n laboratory chemicals business sells more than 6,000 different products, including high purity solvents, analytical reagents and organic chemicals, that are used in research and process laboratories throughout the world.  Production, packaging and primary distribution operations will remain at the laboratory chemicals business’ site.  Sigma-Aldrich will sell and market the partnership’s products globally.
<p>
	The laboratory chemicals business currently has worldwide sales of about (U.S.) $40 million annually.  It will employ about 200 persons in Seelze who will be under the direction of the partnership’s new president, Dr. Karsten Bode, most recently a vice-president for Sigma-Aldrich at its Fluka subsidiary in Switzerland.

Combining the highly regarded Riedel-de Ha&euml;n brand laboratory chemicals and our other strong brands -- Sigma, Aldrich, Fluka and Supelco -- will better serve the market and, in so doing, will help us become a strong competitor."

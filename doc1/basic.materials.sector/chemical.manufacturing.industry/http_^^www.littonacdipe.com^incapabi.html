PRESS FIT
</strong></font>

<br><br>
<dd>Automated processes for the controlled, consistent placement and insertion of all press fit connector systems and devices, including high density, rivets, polarizing keys, and power lugs.
<br><br>
Capable of inserting up to 1,000 pin connectors automatically.
<br><br>
Custom "gang" tooling for insertion of multiple types of connectors for increased efficiencies.
<br><br>
Blockloader automatically loads multiple contact types.

<br><br>
<dd>Computer-controlled, high precision light beam soldering system for ultra-high performance connectors with pitches of .025" and .050" over a span of 5.8".
<br><br>
Integrated, computer controlled, vacuum solder system with preheater, flux and automated solder fountain for thick backpanels with heat sinking outerlayers and/or signal layers close to the surface.
<br><br>
Direct power system operates at lower temperatures for thick multilayers with heavy ground planes.
<br><br>

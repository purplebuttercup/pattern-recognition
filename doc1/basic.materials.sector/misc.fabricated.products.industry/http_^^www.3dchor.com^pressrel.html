<I>Chapel Hill, NC</I>--We're proud to introduce <B>3d Choreographer Version 2.0</B> at 1995 Comdex Fall
in Las Vegas  NV.  While keeping the same ease of use which won it the WIN 100 award for 1995, version 2.0 adds several new features.   You can create original 3D characters by replacing the heads of the actors with those of your own design. This unique feature allows you to attach either photos or drawings to the bodies of 3D actors.   Imagine an animation of your boss giving out bonuses, a company logo dueling its competitor's logo or your child's head on a charging triceratops.   Make inspired political cartoons with battling politicians shaking the Capitol building.  <P>
All <B>3d Choreographer</B> characters come with an extensive action library so the characters you create can already run, jump,
swim, or dance.  You can dynamically flip between bitmaps to simulate head movements and facial expressions.  Of course,<B> 3d Choreographer</B> still has a large variety of pre-made characters and actions.   User can quickly and easily create custom characters and sophisticated animations.  These animations can be rendered as FLCs or with 16 million colors using 24 bit AVI files.

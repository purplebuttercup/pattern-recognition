<p align="center"><b><u>AFC Cable Systems Named Among </u></b><font
size="2"><b><u>BOSTON GLOBE'S</u></b></font><b><u> Top
Massachusetts Companies</u></b></p>

<p>NEW BEDFORD, Mass., May 23 <font size="2">THE BOSTON GLOBE</font>
has ranked AFC Cable Systems, Inc. number 41 in its annual
selection of the top 100 Massachusetts publicly traded companies.
In addition, AFC was number 38 in the <font size="2">GLOBE</font>'s
list of the 50 fastest growing Massachusetts public companies.</p>

<p>The company, founded here in 1926 as American Flexible Conduit
Company, manufactures modular wiring systems, armored cable, and
associated products that distribute data, voice, and power to
computers, workstations, electronic point-of-sale terminals, and
other equipment.</p>

<p>&quot;Our success proves that you can design and manufacture
engineered, industrial products to world-class quality standards,
and do so profitably, in the Northeast,&quot; said Robert R.
Wheeler, president.</p>

<p>&quot;In 1996, we purchased, expanded, and modernized a
125,000 square-foot plant near our operations headquarters in New
Bedford, Mass.,&quot; Wheeler said. &quot;None-theless, we are
running three shifts per day, six days per week, with a record
manufacturing output in March, and have equipment on-order for
delivery through the year so we can move to the next capacity
level.&quot;</p>

<p>The<font size="2"> GLOBE</font> said that, for the main list,
it ranks corporations with at least </p>

<p>$25 million in sales on four equally weighted measures: return
on shareholders' equity, annual sales, sales growth, and change
in profit margin (net income as a percentage of sales).</p>

<p>&quot;We think this mixture captures the essential components
of a quality company,&quot; said Charles Stein of the <font
size="2">GLOBE</font> staff. For the Growth 50, the newspaper
bases rankings on annual average increase in profits and sales
over the last two years. The company must have had at least $10
million in 1994 sales and $1 million in 1994 profits, and been
publicly traded for two years.</p>

<p>The principal application of AFC's products is to create power
and communications networks in office towers, computer centers,
retail malls, hospitals, universities, and other complexes. These
products, which are used in new construction and remodeling,
include modular wiring systems, prewired armored cable, flexible
conduit, and electrical fittings. Sales in 1996 were
$161,868,000. Its stock is traded on Nasdaq's National Market
System under the symbol AFCX.</p>

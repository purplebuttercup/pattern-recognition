<center><h2>Animated Communications, Inc.<BR>
Introduces <I>The 3D Dojo</I>. </h2></center>

 With 3D Dojo you
can create your own animations for the martial arts.  All the characters
have built-in stances, blocks, hand and leg actions.  They are dressed in
traditional karate costumes or Kung Fu outfits. They include men and women
of all races. 
The actions were developed by an animator who is also a 3rd degree black
belt and whose father is a well known instructor with a 7th degree black belt.
You can use the built-in actions as is or modify them to suit your own
school of martial arts.<p>

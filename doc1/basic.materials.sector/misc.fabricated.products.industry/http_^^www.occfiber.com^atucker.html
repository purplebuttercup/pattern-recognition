<BLOCKQUOTE><H2>SUMMARY</H2>

<em><B>Optical Cable Corporation</B>, based in Roanoke, Virginia, manufactures and markets a
broad line of fiber optic cable used primarily to transmit data, voice and video
information.  The company is the second largest supplier of tight buffered fiber optic
cable in the "moderate distance" market segment comprising cable runs up to ten miles.</em>


<p><B>T</B>he use of fiber optic cable has increased as the cost effectiveness of the technology
has improved and the demand for higher capacity communications circuits has
increased.  In 1996 the worldwide market for fiber optic cable was about $5.9 billion
and growing about 20% per year.  <B>O</B>ptical <B>C</B>able <B>C</B>orporation (OCC) has focused on a
segment of the market that addresses cable runs of less than ten miles and includes
the wiring used to carry data in local area networks (LANs), telephone company local
loops and cable TV systems.  By addressing this niche market, OCC has been able to
grow somewhat faster than the overall market, or about 25% per year over the last two
years to $45 million in sales in 1996.  With a differentiated product and a proprietary,
low-cost manufacturing technology, we believe that OCC is well positioned to continue
increasing its share of a market that we expect to continue growing at or above the
current rate.  We are initiating coverage of <B>O</B>ptical <B>C</B>able <B>C</B>orporation with a Buy
recommendation.


<ul>
  <li><strong>A well established market trend.</strong>  The increasing use of fiber optic
transmission facilities in communications networks is well established.  We
believe the need for increased communications bandwidth will continue to drive
this major technology trend.
  <li><strong>Positioned to take market share.</strong>  OCC has positioned itself in the fastest
growing niche market in the fiber optic cable market with a proprietary
manufacturing process and a superior product.  We believe OCC is well
positioned to accelerate its market share gains.
  <li><strong>Accelerating earnings growth.</strong>  We believe OCC's accelerating share gain will
translate into a higher rate of growth for the company.  We forecast an increase
from the 25% sales growth that has characterized the company recently to 45%
per year or better.
  <li><strong>Purchase recommended.</strong>  We are initiating coverage of OCC with a Buy
recommendation.  Our 12-month price target is $18.</UL>



<H3>Background</H3>

T<B>h</B>e advantages of optical fiber as a communications medium has been recognized
since the technology was developed in the mid-1970s, but the cost of the optical fiber
and the associated electronics prevented its deployment until the mid-1980s when
single-mode fiber optic systems began to be installed in the long distance transmission
facilities of the telephone companies.  Essentially all terrestrial and submarine
communication systems now use fiber optic cables and, as the economics have
continuously improved and the demand for bandwidth has increased, fiber optic cable
is being used in more and more applications.


<p><B>T</B>he main advantage of optical fiber as a communications medium is its high
transmission capacity, also known as bandwidth.  Compared to the highest speed
copper cables, a fiber optic cable has thousands of times the information carrying
capacity while occupying less space and operating more reliably over longer distances.
In addition, it is immune to electromagnetic interference and electrical surges.  Because
it does not carry electricity, it is safer in flammable environments.  It also offers higher
security since it is difficult to tap without detection.


<p><B>T</B>he economics of fiber optic systems have improved steadily, allowing the use of fiber
optic cable in more and more applications formerly served by copper.  In the future, we
expect that optical fiber will be widely deployed, not only in long distance telephone
circuits but also in telephone company local loops, commercial buildings, cable TV
systems and data networks, including LANs and campus-wide networks.  Gigabit
Ethernet, the next high speed data networking technology, requires fiber optic cable to
operate over any meaningful distance.


<H3>The Market Opportunity</H3>

<B>T</B>he world market for fiber optic cable in 1996 was about $5.9 billion, and has been
growing at about 20% per year.  This market is comprised of two main forms of fiber
optic cable, single-mode and multi-mode.


<p><B>F</B>or long distance transmission, single-mode is the preferred technology, offering high
capacity and low attenuation over long distances.  The associated electronics and
connectors are expensive, but since the typical system has long cable runs between
the electronics, the economics of the system remain attractive.


<p><B>S</B>ingle-mode fiber currently represents about 90% of the unit volume of fiber optic cable
and about 80% of the dollar volume.  The largest application for single-mode fiber optic
cable is in long distance terrestrial and submarine telephony applications.  In 1996, the
market for single-mode fiber optic cable was about $4.5 billion with a projected growth
rate of about 20% per year.


<p><B>M</B>ulti-mode fiber offers advantages in applications where the transmission distances
are shorter than in the long distance market.  The electronics and connectors for multi-mode fiber are less expensive, thus improving the economics of a system, such as a
LAN, where, compared to a long distance installation, there is relatively more in the
way of electronics and connectors and less in the way of optical fiber.  The lower unit
volume of fiber optic cable used in these mostly medium-distance applications is
reflected in a lower share of the overall market.  In 1996, the market for multi-mode
fiber optic cable was about $1.1 billion with a projected growth rate of about 22% per
year.

<H3>OPTICAL CABLE CORPORATION</H3>

<B>O</B>ptical <B>C</B>able <B>C</B>orporation was founded in 1983 by two engineers who had been
responsible for the government-funded fiber optic cable development work at the ITT
Electro-Optical Products Division in Roanoke, Virginia.  During the late 1970s and early
1980s, ITT captured nearly all of the government-funded R&amp;D programs for
development of fiber optic components and systems, including the development of
extremely strong, lightweight and rugged fiber optic cable for military use.


<p><B>F</B>rom its inception, OCC pioneered the use of military tactical cable technology,
combined with advanced manufacturing techniques, to offer new cable designs
specifically optimized for the requirements of moderate-distance LAN installations.
This cable differed significantly from the cable being manufactured by the major
suppliers for the long distance market.


<p><B>B</B>ecause the early single-mode fiber was relatively brittle and subject to damage
through rough handling, the manufacturers of single-mode cable adopted a technology
known as "gel-filled loose tube" (GFLT) in which the fiber strands "float" in a viscous gel
inside a hard outer casing.  Produced in large volume and cost effective for long
distances such as between cities, GFLT cable is difficult to use and expensive to
terminate.  The majority of fiber optic cable produced today is still GFLT although it is
losing share to a newer technology.


<p><B>U</B>sing technology that had been developed for tactical military cable, OCC pioneered
the production of a "tight-buffered" design in which the outer jacket of the cable is
extruded under high pressure directly over the cable's core, resulting in a cable that is
more flexible and more durable than the gel-filled cables and also permits a simpler
and less expensive method of termination.  Unlike the gel-filled cable, which cannot be
used indoors because of the volatility of the gel filling, the OCC tight-buffered cable can
be used both indoors and outdoors.


<H3>Markets</H3>


<p><B>T</B>he introduction of OCC's improved optical cable coincided with the rapid growth of
networking and the company found a ready market for its products in the wiring of
buildings for local area networks.  To date, optical fiber has been used mainly for
network backbones using FDDI (fiber distributed data interface), a technology built
around optical fiber as a transmission medium.  With the advent of additional high
speed backbone technologies such as ATM and Gigabit Ethernet, both of which require
the higher bandwidth provided by optical fiber, the market for fiber optic cable in LANs
is expected to show dramatic growth over the next several years.


<p><B>I</B>n addition to LANs, we expect OCC's tight-buffered cable to find additional
applications in the medium-distance fiber optic cable market, defined as cable spans
less than ten miles.  We believe GFLT fiber optic cable will remain the dominant
product in long haul telephone networks.  The large cable manufacturers have
significant manufacturing capacity committed to GFLT technology and the high volume
insures a low unit cost.  However, over shorter distances, where installation and
termination costs are a larger part of the overall system expense, tight-buffered cable,
while more expensive than GFLT on a unit basis, can often achieve a lower total
installed system cost.  Other applications included in this market sector include the
local loop of the telephone network, cable TV systems, building and campus
communication systems and traffic control systems.  About half of the fiber optic cable
used in the medium-distance market today is GFLT.


<p><B>C</B>able for LAN applications currently represents about 75%-80% of OCC's business,
with industrial applications another 15%-20%, video about 5% and military less than
5%.  Single-mode cable is currently about one-third of OCC's business and is growing
faster than multi-mode cable as its use increases in the telephone company local loop,
CATV systems and among OEM manufacturers in the telecommunications equipment
market who use it for terminations, jumpers and patch panels associated with their fiber
optic system components.


<p><B>T</B>he telephone company local loop, which represents about 90% of the cable footage in
the telephone system, represents the largest potential future market.  This market has
not yet developed, as the installed copper plant, upgraded with electronics such as
digital subscriber loop carrier (xDSL), appears to still meet the demands of the local
loop.  However, over time, as the demand for bandwidth in the local loop continues to
increase and the economics of fiber optic systems continues to improve, this market
could be substantial.


<H3>Products</H3>


<p><B>W</B>ith its highly flexible manufacturing facility, OCC can manufacture literally thousands
of different fiber optic cables to meet the exact specifications of a particular job.  The
product line is described in a detailed 128-page catalog which allows the customer to
define the exact specifications required for an application.  The company offers three
distinct types of cable construction in three basic cable styles using both single-mode
and multi-mode optical fiber.  Rather than limiting its customers to just standard
products, the company will also help customers identify special requirements and will
supply appropriately designed products.


<p><B>OCC</B> believes its tightly buffered cable provides at least eight advantages over its
competition: 1) better protection in wet environments resulting in longer life and
increased reliability, 2) proof testing at higher stress levels to provide longer cable life,
3) an exclusive cable jacket design that provides better crush and impact protection
and improved tear resistance during installation, 4) a 25% improvement in temperature
range, 5) lower termination costs, 6) flame retardant materials and design, 7) dual
indoor/outdoor use and 8) higher density packaging resulting in the smallest band
radius in the industry.


<p><B>I</B>n addition to its standard and custom cables, OCC also manufactures private label
cables for customers and competitors in other segments of the fiber optic cable market.


<H3>Distribution</H3>


<p><B>T</B>he company sells direct to the U.S. Government, original equipment manufacturers
and some Regional Bell Operating Companies, but about 80% of OCC's sales are
through national distributors such as Graybar, Anicom and Wesco, as well as strong
regional datacomm distributors.  The company has a 26-person outside sales force
managed by three regional vice presidents whose job is to develop sales situations for
the company's distributors.  This organization is supported by six inside salespeople
who take orders and provide quotes and twelve sales associates who leverage the
outside sales force by looking for new business opportunities for the sales force to call
on.


<p><B>O</B>utside the U.S. OCC also sells through distributors.  OCC's international sales were
about 25% of total sales in 1996 and are expected to increase to 50% or more over the
next two years.  The foreign manufacturers of fiber optic cables have benefitted for
years by the price protection afforded by the state-owned telecommunications
authorities.  With the advent of deregulation around the world and especially in Europe,
these protected competitors with essentially non-competitive plants are expected to
lose market share to U.S. competitors.  We further expect OCC to gain market share
from its U.S. competitors as it has been doing in the market for tight buffered cable.


<p><B>I</B>n 1996 no single customer accounted for more than 5% of its net sales, although one
distributor accounted for about 12% of sales.  The company does business with over
three thousand customers and over 80% of the orders are under $50 thousand.  Both
of these factors tend to stabilize order flow.  Sales are somewhat seasonal with softer
business in the first two quarters due to the impact of winter weather on outside
construction.  Revenue in each quarter results from orders received in that quarter and
the backlog is not indicative of future sales.


<H3>Competition</H3>


<p><B>T</B>he largest competitor for fiber optic cable is copper wire, the established legacy
technology.  While fiber optic cable has shown dramatic growth over the last ten years,
it has had an insignificant impact on the growth of the market for copper-based cables.
This will continue to be true for the foreseeable future, even as the economics of optical
fiber continue to improve and the demand for increased bandwidth grows.  Within the
overall fiber optic cable market, GFLT technology represents the largest competitive
product.


<p><B>A</B>mong the suppliers of fiber optic cable, Siecor, a joint venture between Siemens and
Corning, and Lucent are the leading manufacturers of fiber optic cable for both the long
distance telephone and the moderate distance market.  Although FGLT cables
represent the largest part of both Siecor's and Lucent's production, both also
manufacture tight buffered fiber optic cable for the moderate distance market.


<p><B>OCC</B> believes that it is the second largest supplier to the tight buffer, moderate
distance market behind Siecor and that it has been growing faster than Siecor for the
last several years.  OCC believes that it can achieve the leading share of this market in
the next several years, with continued market share gains in the U.S. and an
aggressive expansion of its international business.


<H3>Manufacturing</H3>


<p><B>M</B>anufacturing consists of applying a variety of raw plastic materials to optical fibers.
The key material in this process is optical fiber which the company obtains from several
suppliers, including Spectran, Corning, Lucent and Alcatel.  Corning and Lucent
dominate the world market for optical fiber with a combined market share estimated to
be over 45%.  The company maintains multiple sources for all of its raw materials.
Because all of its optical fiber suppliers are also competitors in the market for finished
fiber optic cable, OCC has considered from time to time integrating backwards into the
manufacture of its own optical fiber.


<p><B>W</B>hile none of the company's current manufacturing processes or products are
protected by patents, the company believes that its proprietary knowledge with respect
to the development and manufacture of fiber optic cables is a significant competitive
advantage.  The company also believes that its computer-controlled manufacturing
equipment, which is developed by the company and manufactured to its specifications,
enables the company to produce fiber optic cable of higher quality and at lower cost
than its competitors.  All the company's manufacturing processes meet required
worldwide standards and its Quality Management System is certified to meet ISO 9001.
The current plant, while operating at a high level of efficiency, has substantial excess
capacity, as a result of a capacity expansion completed in January 1997, that enables
the company to respond quickly to special customer requirements and will enable the
company to accommodate sales growth going forward.


<H3>Management and Corporate Developments</H3>


<p><B>R</B>obert <B>K</B>opstein, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer,
founded the company in 1983 as a partnership with a fellow engineer from the ITT
Electro-Optical Products Division in Roanoke, Virginia.  Both had had extensive
experience in the development of optical fiber technology for military applications.  Mr.
Kopstein bought out his partner on June 22, 1989, and operated the business as a
Subchapter S corporation until the company's public offering on April 1, 1998.  Unable
to obtain a satisfactory underwriting commitment from the investment banking
community, the company advertised and successfully executed its own public offering,
selling 2.675 million shares of the Company's common stock from which it received net
proceeds of approximately $5.8 million.  The company currently has about 38.7 million
shares outstanding, of which Mr. Kopstein owns 93% or 36.0 million shares.  The
remaining 2.7 million shares are the publicly traded float.


<p><B>T</B>he other senior officers of the company are Luke Huybrechts, Senior Vice President of
Sales, a colleague of Mr. Kopstein from ITT, and Kenneth Harber, Vice President of
Finance.


<H3>Financials</H3>


<p><B>OCC</B> has operated profitably since its inception, achieving record sales and earnings in
the fiscal year ending October 31, 1996, of $7.5 million in net income or $0.19 per
share on sales of $45.2 million.  We are estimating earnings of $0.23 per share on
sales of $55.6 million for 1997 and $0.38 per share on sales of $81.2 million for 1999.


<p><B>T</B>he business is seasonal to a degree because weather in the winter can delay the
installation of outdoor cable.  Thus OCC's business tends to be stronger in the second
half of the year compared to the first half.  In the current year, second quarter sales
were impacted by bad weather in Europe, which had the worst winter weather in
memory, and a general softness in telecommunications related spending in the major
European economies.  We expect sales to rebound strongly in the third and fourth
quarters and to continue a seasonal pattern in 1998.


<p><B>T</B>he balance sheet is clean.  Cash was reduced in the first half of FY 1997 to $350
thousand because of the company's investment in an expansion of the existing plant.
With less than $2.0 million of capital expenditures planned, we expect cash to be
rebuilt to over $12.0 million in 1998.  Accounts receivable were 67 days sales at the
end of the second quarter and inventory turns were 4.2 times.


<H3>Valuation</H3>


<p><B>C</B>urrently selling at 38.8 times October 1998 estimated earnings, the stock is not
inexpensive at $14 3/4.  However, it is selling near the low end of its historic P/E range,
having recovered somewhat from the price decline following the weak second quarter
report when the stock fell to a 62-week low of $7.  We believe that earnings will show a
strong rebound in the third quarter and that the stock is not likely to revisit these lows
anytime soon.  Thus we do not believe in waiting for the stock to pull back.


<p><B>W</B>ith an EPS growth rate going forward of 35% per year or better, we believe the stock
can command at least 30 times forward 12-months earnings.  Using a preliminary
estimate for FY 1999 of $0.60 per share, our 12-month price target for the stock is $18.

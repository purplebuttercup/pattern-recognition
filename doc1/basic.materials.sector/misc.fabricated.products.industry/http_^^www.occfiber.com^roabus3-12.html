<B>B</B>ob <B>K</B>opstein, Chairman and President of <B>O</B>ptical <B>C</B>able <B>C</B>orp. of Roanoke, was looking pleased with the way his company's first shareholders' meeting had gone Tuesday morning,  as he chatted with a few departing stragglers.
<BR><BR>
<B>T</B>hat's despite shareholders who barraged him with questions about the fiber-optic cable manfacturer, which sold its shares to the public last spring for the first time.  Kopstein patiently provided answers for about an hour, sometimes in intricate detail.
<BR><BR>
<B>"I</B> was very impressed with their friendly and sincere interest in the individual investor,"
said Marie Grady, a stockholder from Blacksburg. "I thought it was wonderful," she said of the meeting.<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 align=left>

<B>G</B>rady's comments were characteristic of those of other stockholders who accounted for roughly 40 of the 56 people attending the meeting at Hotel Roanoke.
<BR><BR>
<B>B</B>ecause this was the company's first public stockholders meeting, Kopstein said he'd had no idea if just two people would show up or whether he should have rented a bigger room.


   The questions ran the gamut
   of the company's business.<BR><BR>
       <B>O</B>ne person wanted to know if
   a merger or sale might be in the
   company's future.<BR><BR>
       <B>"Y</B>ou never know what's going
   to develop," Kopstein replied.  His
   company wants to be a fixture in
   the global marketplace and, in
   working toward that goal, develops relationships and partnerships
   with a variety of other companies,
   he said.<BR><BR>
       <B>A</B>nother asked whether a
   competitor could copy <B>O</B>ptical
  <B> C</B>able's products and cut into the
   company's business.<BR><BR>
       <B>T</B>echnology that the company
   uses would be costly to duplicate,
   Kopstein said; but, more importantly, the company's expertise in
   making its rugged, tight-buffered
   cables rises as a barrier to would-be
 competitors.<BR><BR>
       <B>K</B>opstein told a shareholder
   who was interested in the
   company's proposal to move trading of its common stock from the
   NASDAQ stock market to the New
   York Stock Exchange that the
   company is awaiting a vote by administrators of the Big Board.<BR><BR>
       <B>K</B>opstein said the company
   has been gaining market share on
   its competitors for more than two
   years, but one of the company's
   biggest challenges is getting name
   recognition.<BR><BR>
       <B>H</B>e related an anecdote about
   a sales call on Microsoft, the computer software giant, which had
   never heard of <B>O</B>ptical <B>C</B>able.

<B> N</B>ow, Bill Gates, Microsoft's
  Chairman, has some of <B>O</B>ptical
  <B>C</B>able's  product strung on his
  yacht, he said.<BR><BR>
      <B>L</B>ast summer, <B>O</B>ptical <B>C</B>able
  stock climbed from its original
  price of $10 per share to $136 per
  share before settling back down.
  Currently, after two stock splits,
  it's selling for about $14 per
  share.  That makes the original
  shares worth more than five times
  the price at which they first were
  offered.<BR><BR>
      <B>O</B>n Tuesday, the stock closed
  at $13.75 a share, down 50 cents
  from Monday.<BR><BR>
      <B>"I</B>t's nice to see a company
  like this in the Roanoke Valley,"
  said Bill Wilcher, a shareholder
  from Craig County.  "Their job at
  this point," he said, "is to make
  information available to the public, and [Kopstein] certainly tried
  to do that today."<BR><BR>
      <B>K</B>opstein and Robert Thompson, both former engineers at ITT
  Electro-Optical Products Division
  in Roanoke County, formed <B>O</B>ptical <B>C</B>able in 1983 with the help of
  local financial backers.  Kopstein
  bought out Thompson and the
  others in 1989.  He sold 760,000
  shares of the company to the public last March, while retaining 9
  million shares.<BR><BR>
      <B>T</B>he company reported 1996
  earnings of $9.2 million on sales
  of $45.2 million.  Earnings for the
  quarter ended Jan. 31 were $2.1
  million, a 21.7 percent increase
  over the same period last year.
  Sales for the quarter were $12.5
  million, up about 21 percent from
  a year earlier.

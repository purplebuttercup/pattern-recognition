<P>In 1996, Whittaker Aerospace Group continued to build on its
industry wide
reputation for designing and developing high quality, high
reliability and
performance-packed aerospace, defense, and industrial products. 
Products in the
Aerospace Group are manufactured and marketed worldwide by three
Whittaker
divisions.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="/gifs/valve.gif" ALT="Valve" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><B><A
HREF="wcs.html">Whittaker Control Systems</A>.-
</B>The Company's Whittaker Controls  division provides hydraulic,
pneumatic and
fuel control valves installed in critical flight and flow control
systems on
virtually every aircraft and jet engine manufactured in the world
with the
exception of former Soviet and Communist countries. These valves
and control
systems are fitted on a wide array of military and commercial
aircraft
positioned from nose to tail.</P>
<P>
 During the past year, Whittaker also signed contracts with
industrial product
manufacturers to supply various control systems for jet engines
configured for
use in the growing field of power co-generation.  Control valves
for these
land-based systems were designed and delivered to <A
HREF="http://www.ge.com/">General
Electric</A>, <A HREF="http://www.ssss.com/">Stewart &amp;
Stevenson</A> and
Cooper Industries.</P>

Safety Systems</A>.- </B> Whittaker Safety Systems develops a wide
range of fire
and overheat sensors and detectors as well as specialized control
panels and
monitors for the aircraft and industrial markets.  Products
developed by Safety
Systems are used in demanding applications where reliability and
performance are
critical to system operation and overall safety.  Safety Systems
has installed
its flame and overheat sensors on scores of commercial and military
aircraft
engines, power co-generation turbines, mass transit systems and in
industrial
applications to include the petro-chemcial facilities.</P>

</B>For more
than four decades, Whittaker Electronic Systems (WES) and its
predecessor
operations have been called on by the Armed Forces and defense
industry to
design, develop and manufacture state of the art products to meet
the country's
evolving strategic and tactical national security needs.</P>
<P>
Innovative hardware, such as the <A HREF="seps.html">Shortstop
Electronic
Protection System (SEPS)</A> and <A HREF="tbmews.htm">Advanced
Early Warning
Systems</A>, digital RF memories and ruggedized displays and
monitors were
created in direct response to specific mission-critical
requirements. Today WES
commands a well-deserved worldwide reputation for  radar
countermeasures and
command and control systems' superiority, delivering top quality
technology
backed by integrated logistics support such as in-the-field
overhaul, repair and
training Whittaker will continue to make investments in new
technology
development in order to maintain a leadership position in its
specialized niche
areas of the defense electronics market. </P>
<P>
The defense industry remains in a state of overall consolidation
and recession
and is likely to remain as such for the foreseeable future. 
However, recent
commitments by the Administration to increase spending for defense
electronics
in such areas as survivability and <A HREF="c3_prod.html">C3</A>
are
encouraging, as are growing demands for exportable technologies
from foreign
nations seeking to meet regional security needs.  International
demand in
defense segments such as advanced early-warning systems and
tactical ballistic
missile detection is evident since the Gulf War.  Developing
countries continue
to assess national security threats and acquire tactical ballistic
missile and
associated weapons systems from the major weapons-producing
countries, who are
seeking increased exports to maintain internal economic stability
and a sound
defense industrial base. </P>

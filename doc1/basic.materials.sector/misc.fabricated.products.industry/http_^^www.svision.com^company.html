<p>Super Vision International, Inc. (the &quot;Company&quot;) is
a recognized innovator and leader in the creative use of fiber
optic lighting designed to meet the needs of a diverse and
changing market. From a company specializing in custom fiber
optic designs and installations for the entertainment industry,
we have grown to be a manufacturer of a full range of fiber optic
lighting products for the signage, swimming pool, architectural,
advertising and retail industries. </p>

<p>The Super Vision product line is designed to expand the
currently available market for fiber optic lighting through
reductions in cost relative to other lighting mediums, while
offering the additional features of changing color and movement
not available in traditional lighting products. From high end
light sources and side glow fiber optic cables to small point of
purchase fiber optic end point signs to custom fiber optic
displays, the Company is able to tailor its products to meet the
needs of a broad n umber of markets. </p>

<p><b>PRODUCTS AND SERVICES </b></p>

<p><b>Side-Glow Cable</b> </p>

<p>The Company's side-glow fiber optic lighting cables utilize a
patented reflective center core in the manufacturing process to
produce a plastic cable which gives off light along its length,
rather than just at the end points. The Company markets this cabl
e with a halogen or metal-halide light source as an alternative
to neon lighting for indoor and outdoor architectural accents and
large signs and displays. The Company has been issued one United
States relating to the reflective center core used i n the
process of manufacturing its side-glow cables and has filed a
patent application relating to its light source technology. While
the Company's side-glow cable currently does not achieve the
level of brightness of neon, the Company believes its benefi ts
outweigh the brightness factor for a large segment of the current
neon market. Fiber optic lighting cable is flexible and easy to
install, is not prone to the breakage associated with glass neon
tubes and is energy efficient, providing significant savi ngs in
electrical costs and maintenance. In addition, unlike neon, the
Company's product is capable of changing color. The cables are
offered in a variety of diameters with awide range of light
sources. This allows flexibility to the market in the choice of
the integration of a variety of products to produce
a&quot;custom&quot; fiber optic lighting system. When combined
with the Company's light source control systems, multiple light
sources and cables can be synchronized to provide large scale
controlled lighting s ystems and to create unique lighting
effects. To date, the Company's side-glow cable has been used in
major installations worldwide, including the Tokyo Dome and
Mitsui Greenland Amusement Park in Japan and Walt Disney World in
Orlando, Florida. The Compa ny believes that this product area
offers the largest growth potential and therefore, the Company
intends to devote the majority of its engineering and sales and
marketing efforts to expand this area of its business. </p>

<p><b>End Point Signs and Displays </b></p>

<p>The Company's end point fiber optic products employ fiber
optic strands with a flexible light source system to create
signs, displays and special effects in virtually unlimited
shapes, sizes, designs and colors using fiber optic end points.
This technolog y can be utilized in point of purchase signage as
an alternative to static signage, adding motion and color to a
logo or advertisement. Studies by various groups have shown that
motion and color in signage can increase attention time by 400%.
End point fi ber optics are also used in large scale signage,
including billboards. The flexibility of the Company's end point
lighting system allows adaptation to numerous other mediums, from
simulated galaxies in movie theater ceilings and walkways to
trade show dis plays. These products have been incorporated by
numerous restaurants, movie theaters and hotels to create
nightscape effects, advertising, signage and have been
incorporated in floats and other special effects displays for
Walt Disney World and EuroDisney land. The Company has also
produced fiber optic signs and displays for AT&amp;T, Blockbuster
Entertainment, Inc., Coca-Cola Bottling Company and McDonalds
Corporation. </p>

        President <br>
        Supervision International Inc. <br>
        2442 Viscount Row <br>
        Orlando, FL 32809</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Dear Brett: </p>
        <p>Thank you for Supervision's SUPER support of our <a
        href="/gif/logo.gif">Electric Technology</a> exhibit at
        our national association's annual meeting held this week
        in Orlando. The high tech image presented by
        Supervision's video wall, fiber optic lighting and, of
        course, Max the robot, provided the perfect setting to
        communicate the efficiencies and environrnental benefits
        of electric technology. </p>
        <p>You and your staff were always cooperative, gracious,
        and supportive throughout all phases of this project from
        the planning to setting up and breaking down of the
        exhibit. And, of course, we appreciated the friendly
        individuals who helped man the exhibit. Max the robot and
        his helper, Mark Haviland, were the &quot;hit of the
        show.&quot; There were over 11,500 people, including Max,
        who registered for this meeting, and it seemed like most
        of them came by our exhibit! </p>
        <p>We look forward to your membership in the Electric
        Council for the Economy (ECE). </p>
        <p>Sincerely, </p>
        <p></p>

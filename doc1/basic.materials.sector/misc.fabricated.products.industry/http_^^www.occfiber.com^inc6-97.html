<IMG SRC="images/incbull.gif"  align=left hspace=5>In contrast to Netscape Communications' much-ballyhooed initial public offering
in 1995, <I><B>Optical Cable Corp.'s</B></I> 1996 IPO went virtually unnoticed by Wall Street.
<I>Optical Cable's</I> IPO resulted in a similar outcome: a founding stockholder
became a paper billionaire. But in this case, the 10th digit came and went so fast
that its beneficiary, an electrical engineer named <B>R</B>obert <B>K</B>opstein, had scant time
to celebrate. The next day the market took away what it had bestowed only the
day before--in spectacular fashion even by 1996's stupefying standards.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><B>U</B>ntil his company's April 2, 1996, offering (as OCCF on Nasdaq), <B>K</B>opstein, the
chief executive officer of <I>Optical Cable</I>, had been the sole shareholder in the
company, a fiber-optic cable manufacturer he'd costarted (with partners, whom he
later bought out) in Roanoke, Va., in 1983. After selling 670,000 newly issued
shares, he still retained 93% of the company, or $90 million worth. You might
think that he'd have been content with that achievement: professionals expect a
small company going public to sell more of itself than a mere 7%--generally, they
told <B>K</B>opstein, closer to 25%. But <B>K</B>opstein's accomplishments didn't stop there.
Seven weeks later, to his and everyone else's astonishment, the price of the
stock soared to $136 (not adjusted for two splits), a spectacular increment that
pushed <I>Optical Cable's</I> market value past $1.4 billion and <B>K</B>opstein's portion to
$1.3 billion. By the close of the next day his net worth had retreated to $800
million, give or take. After two two-for-one stock splits, in May and June, <I>Optical
Cable's</I> stock settled back to around $46 (not adjusted for the splits) and closed
up 360% for the year. Had all that drama unfolded under the banner of a
prominent investment banker, <I>Optical Cable's</I> IPO would doubtlessly have been
hailed as the hottest of the year.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><B>N</B>one of it did, however. The flotation was pulled off by a total novice--<B>K</b>opstein
himself--and in virtually every review of that record year, the then-46-year-old
upstart was airbrushed out of existence. When a stock gains 1,200% in six weeks
and splits twice in 21 days, it's usually a matter for investigation. No such cloud
hung over <I>Optical Cable</I>, which came to market boasting a history of steady
growth and legitimate net sales of $36.4 million. What's more, the company
reported net income of $8.2 million--$8.2 million more than Netscape.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><IMG SRC="images/inc1.jpg" align=left hspace=5>
<p><B>I</B>f <B>K</b>opstein had committed any offense, it was snubbing the good old boys: his
deal didn't employ the services of the investment-banking crowd. But not for lack
of trying. <B>K</b>opstein's <I>initial</I> initial-public-offering urge had struck in 1992,
when his company's net sales were at $19.8 million. He intended to raise only
$15 million, enough to expand the factory facilities, hire outside salespeople, pay
down some debt, and set aside stock for employee options. So, starting with San
Francisco's Montgomery Securities (which, he says, advised him to wait until the
company was bigger), he called on prominent investment bankers who
specialized in technology. "People told me that if you're in high tech, be sure to
get a company that has good research people who can tell the story of what
you're really about," says <B>K</b>opstein.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><B>T</B>he half a dozen underwriters with whom he met over the years--including those
from such prominent houses as Robinson Humphrey and Dean Witter--couldn't
be bothered. One demurred on the grounds that while its researchers were
familiar with most things electronic, they knew nothing about optical fiber. Another
was simply too busy. A third felt the deal was too trifling to bother with. "For
anyone looking to do a small offering," <B>K</b>opstein says, recalling his
disillusionment after the last underwriter, Rodman &amp; Renshaw, in New York City,
turned him down, "there was scant interest."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><IMG SRC="images/inc2.jpg" align=right hspace=5>
<p><B>I</B>n the fall of 1995 <B>K</b>opstein at last persuaded an investment banker, Unterberg
Harris, of New York City, to handle the proposed underwriting of 1.5 million
shares of <I>Optical Cable</I>. The firm printed up preliminary offering prospectuses
showing itself as the lead underwriter on the left side of the cover (as protocol
dictates), and another investment banker, Piper Jaffray, in Minneapolis, as a
coparticipant, on the right. Unterberg Harris prepped <B>K</b>opstein for personal
appearances on the dog-and-pony circuit. But before the road show ended,
<B>K</b>opstein pulled the plug. The price Unterberg Harris was about to settle for was
disappointingly below the $10 a share <B>K</b>opstein thought his company was worth.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><B>"I</B> didn't realize that when there are two names on a prospectus, there's a big
difference in who's responsible for what," he says of the setup. "I thought I'd hired
a team of horses to pull us to the finish line. But," he says, "the job just didn't get
done."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><B>T</B>hrough a contact, he offered the now-dormant deal to A. G. Edwards and Sons
Inc., in St. Louis. Its head of corporate finance, Spencer Burke, said he'd have to
wait at least six months before the financial community would again pay attention
to the company. But he added, "You're too strong-minded a man to be held back
by what people think. Why not do it yourself?"

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><B>F</B>or a practical answer, <B>K</b>opstein consulted his company's lawyers, McGuire
Woods Battle &amp; Boothe, in Richmond, Va. And counsel "did everything it could to
dissuade me," he says. The lawyers advised that on occasion regional banks
conducted their own small best-efforts offerings over an extended period of time,
but that what <B>K</b>opstein had proposed was unheard of. "I don't want to wait six
months," <B>K</b>opstein insisted. "I want to do it quickly, and I want to do it right."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><B>F</B>or a neophyte financier, those imperatives are at odds. "I didn't realize there
were so many barriers put there to keep this type of offering from happening," he
says. Luckily, two major barriers had already been cleared: registering the
offering statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission and preparing
the instrument that exhaustively describes the deal to potential buyers. <B>K</b>opstein
simply adapted the terms of the earlier "red herring" (so called for the patches of
red ink that identify the publication as being preliminary and subject to change).
Normally, the placement of all offered shares would be guaranteed by
underwriters; <I>Optical Cable's</I> self-underwriting was an arrangement in which
whatever number of shares the public bought would constitute the flotation, and
the receipts from them, less expenses from the IPO, would flow entirely to the
company.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><IMG SRC="images/incgraph.jpg" align=left hspace=5>
<p><B>K</b>opstein's first task was to get as many prospectuses as possible into the hands
of as many prospective buyers as possible. He opened a site on the Internet
posting his intentions, and then he booked tombstone ads--stark announcements
that, by SEC edict, invite a reader only to send for a descriptive prospectus--in
major newspapers. In the states that allowed it, at any rate: in some states those
descriptions didn't meet local Blue Sky laws, the often-antiquated statutes (so
named because they refer to schemes that are worth no more than a patch of
blue sky) that define how securities can be offered to an innocent populace. To
qualify in California, for example, he would have had to change his company's
bylaws and reprint the prospectuses accordingly. In some instances, <B>K</b>opstein
chose not to bother. (He never did get registered in California.) But just in case,
he distributed 10,000 prospectuses to his Roanoke neighbors and then assigned
a cadre of employees to man the phones "like a bunch of telemarketers." Over
four weeks they booked orders for 670,000 shares from some 850 buyers.
<B>K</b>opstein wanted to keep trying and sell another half a million shares. But the
earlier buyers were getting restless. They wanted the stock to start trading in the
open market.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><B>E</B>asier said than done, <B>K</b>opstein discovered. Lacking underwriters, <I>Optical Cable</I>
also lacked market makers. For a company's stock to qualify for a National
Market listing on Nasdaq, not only must that stock meet certain performance
minimums (see "[Doc. No. /incmagazine/archives/06970771]So You Want to Go
Public" ), but the company also must have two third-party dealers to handle
outside orders to buy and sell its shares. For most of the IPO universe, a
company's underwriters ipso facto become its market makers as well as its
research analysts in the financial community.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><B>I</B>t so happened that at this time David Adam, a former Wall Streeter turned
financial freelancer, spotted a tombstone ad and phoned in to ask if there was
anything he could help out with. <B>K</b>opstein didn't hesitate. "Sure," he said, "find me
a couple of market makers." Adam called around to his buddies, but "they
wouldn't touch <B>K</b>opstein. They saw him as a guy trying to out-finesse Wall Street.
Those fellows get nice fees and warrants and stock options and 'green shoes,' but
Bob would have none of it. Everybody said, in effect, 'We don't go down there and
tell him how to make cable.' " It took more than 40 calls for Adam to unearth two
firms willing to handle <I>Optical Cable's </I>stock.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><B>U</B>nderwriters rely on mutual funds and other institutional investors to commit to
the lion's share of an issue and establish its final price. But as a peddler of
unknown merit selling a comparatively scant number of shares in a business
unfamiliar to institutional investors, <B>K</b>opstein reached just one such buyer, Newby
&amp; Co., a Rockville, Md., investment firm, which subscribed to 150,000 shares for
some retirement-fund clients. <B>K</b>opstein blames the absence of other institutional
interest on people's unfamiliarity with his unusual line of business.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><B>"W</B>hat made it difficult for us where it wouldn't have been for others is that there
was no other company doing the same type of thing. When all you have to do is
pull up a set of comparable figures and see where you fit in, selling yourself is
easier. But if institutions don't have a peg by which to judge whether you're better
or worse than other companies, they sit back to see how the market receives the
offering," he says.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><B>K</b>opstein tagged <I>Optical Cable</I> shares at $10 to yield a modest (for a fast-growth
technology issue) price-to-earnings ratio of 17. "I wanted to get a reasonable
amount of shares out there and see how the market accepted the price," he says.
"When we needed more money in the future, we could go back out at whatever
price the market thought the stock ought to be valued."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><B>T</B>he market was even more positive about the stock than <B>K</b>opstein was. The
offering price more than doubled within five weeks, passing $22 on May 9. A
week after that, it was $35; in six days more, $79. "Maybe buyers from
California," the befuddled <B>K</b>opstein conjectured, "were sending in orders for stock
they weren't allowed to buy on the offering."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><B>A</B>s the share price inexplicably jumped some 30% a day, <B>K</b>opstein got a call--not
from the SEC but from CNBC. The financial-news cable network invited him on
the air. On May 23, just after 8:30 a.m., greenhorn <B>K</b>opstein got skewered by the
squawk box. "The interviewers kept shooting arrows. They wanted to know more
about what the stock was doing than what the company was doing." <B>K</b>opstein
guilelessly confessed ignorance to the machinations of the stock market and
seized the moment to educate millions of viewers about <I>Optical Cable</I>--the job at
which he insists the underwriters he'd hired had failed. The billionaire for a day
was astounded by the response. "Right after I got off the air, the stock went
through the roof. People called and E-mailed, saying that the company of a CEO
who could stand up like that while they tried to fill him full of holes--that company
was going to have a fantastic future."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><B>D</B>espite the exhilarating ride, <B>K</b>opstein admits he wouldn't take the solo route
again. Toting up the start-at-5-a.m. days he devoted to the IPO in addition to
running the company, he says that leaving out the middlemen "cost at least as
much as if I'd used an underwriter to do the deal." Nonetheless, acknowledges A.
G. Edwards's Burke, "what he did is incredible. For most CEOs of most
companies, it would be too much of a challenge." But not impossible. "If you have
a good company and good advisers--and a lot of gumption--there's bound to be
somebody who wants to own your stock."

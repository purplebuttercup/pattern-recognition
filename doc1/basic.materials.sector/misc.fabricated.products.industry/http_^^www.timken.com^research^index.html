The Timken Research facility is located near the company's					Canton, Ohio headquarters. The facility is approximately 250,000 square					feet and houses professional and technical staff of 300. An annual budget					of $50 million supports the technology activities of both the Bearing and					Steel Businesses.					<P>					A complete range of manufacturing processes is available within Timken					Research, including a tool room, heat treatment, steel making (rolling					mill) and prototype bearing manufacturing. Specialized laboratories are					dedicated to the sciences of metrology, electronics and lubrication/tribology.					A technical library supports all research efforts. CAD, FEA (finite element					analysis) modeling and advanced bearing design are also performed within					the facilities.					<P>					Testing equipment is continually used to test bearing products from all					Timken Company manufacturing facilities to ensure Timken quality standards					are maintained. Customer application simulation testing, plus testing for					new products and processes are performed.					<P>					Research:<br>					Key Component of Timken Company Leadership					<P>					The Timken Company maintains a formidable 					research and development capability that 					combines strength in fundamental science 					with a solid base of practical knowledge.  					The goal of Timken Research is mastery of 					every technical development that might 					lead to improved products and processes.  					The result is a constantly expanding 					capability in those areas.					<P>					To sustain our global leadership in tapered 					roller bearings and specialty alloy steels, 					research is conducted on three distinct levels:					<UL TYPE=DISC>					 	<LI>basic investigation 					 	<LI>applied research					 	<LI>advanced product and process design.					</UL>					In Timken Research laboratories, these three 					levels of research operate sequentially to 					transform scientific knowledge into advanced 					products and processes our customers must have 					to maintain their own leadership positions.					<P>					Solving a new problem sometimes calls for 					basic research into the scientific fundamentals 					of bearing technology or alloy steel production 					and processing.  In addition, the new understandings 					acquired can play a role in the discovery 					of new products or process refinements.					<P>					Applied research is aimed at focusing the 					underlying scientific principles on 					meeting customer needs.  In many cases, 					the primary knowledge and work already have 					been accomplished by us or others through emerging 					technology.  We add the refinements necessary to 					transform our understanding into specific 					products or processes to solve customer problems.					<P>					When the technology is already available, we work 					to convert this knowledge into efficient, 					innovative production procedures.  					We may use existing manufacturing machines 					and instruments or we may develop entirely new equipment.					<P>					Timken Research solves customer problems and 					contributes to the evolving capabilities of The Timken Company.  					Development of revolutionary manufacturing processes 					has made the company's bearing operations a model of 21st 					century technology.  And research and development associates 					played a leadership role in defining technologies for 					the Faircrest Steel Plant, which produces the finest 					quality alloy steel available anywhere in the world.					<P>					Spurred by a corporate culture that demands continual 					effort to find a better way, the talented and dedicated 					people of Timken Research deliver the products and 					processes required for success in the highly 					competitive markets of today and tomorrow.<P>						<br>						<br>						<IMG SRC="../graphics/general/comp3.gif" ISMAP USEMAP="#comp3" BORDER=0 ALT="Timken Online">					</TD>				<!--@@INSERT@@BODY@@COPY@@END@@-->				</TR>				<TR>					<TD>					<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>					</TD>				</TR>			</TABLE>		<!--@@BODY@@TABLE@@END@@-->	<!--@@INSERT@@IMAGEMAP@@START@@-->			<MAP NAME="menu">				<AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="20,0,64,17" HREF="../index.html">				<AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="20,18,64,36" HREF="/search/index.html">				<AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="65,18,118,36" HREF="/ASP/mail.asp">				<AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="119,18,162,38" HREF="../legal/index.html">			</MAP>			<MAP NAME="comp3">			<AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="32,22,152,58" HREF="../bearings/index.html">			<AREA SHAPE=rect COORDS="175,23,244,53" HREF="../steel/index.html">			</MAP>	<!--@@INSERT@@IMAGEMAP@@END@@-->		</BODY><!--@@BODY@@SECTION@@END@@--></HTML>

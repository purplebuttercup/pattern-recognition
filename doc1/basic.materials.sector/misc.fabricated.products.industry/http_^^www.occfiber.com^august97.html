 <h2> OCC Reports Record Quarterly Revenues<BR> for Third
Quarter</h2>
</center>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR><I><B>Optical Cable Corporation (NASDAQ:OCCF) </B></I>  today announced that it booked $14.3 million in sales for its
third fiscal quarter ended July 31, 1997, a new quarterly record.  The
previous record of $13.8 million was achieved in last year's fiscal fourth
quarter, which ended October 31, 1996.  Revenues for the third quarter of 1997
grew 32% from $10.9 million in the third quarter of 1996 and grew 35%
sequentially from $10.6 million in the second quarter of 1997.

<BR><BR>
<B>O</B>ptical <B>C</B>able reported that the month of July was also a record in terms
of sales.  The Company booked revenues of $5.8 million in the month compared
to the previous record of $5.5 million in October 1996.
<BR><BR>
<B>C</B>ommenting on the record revenues, <B>R</B>obert <B>K</B>opstein, President and Chief
Executive Officer said, "We are very pleased to report these strong results,
particularly given that the prior records were both achieved in the fourth
quarter of 1996, typically our strongest quarter."

<BR><BR>
<B>I</B>n a Dow Jones interview that ran on Friday, August 15, Mr. <B>K</B>opstein was
quoted saying that third quarter revenues "surpassed...internal projections
by 5%" and that he is "more than comfortable" with estimates that the company
will earn between $0.05 and $0.06 per share in the third quarter.  He was
further quoted saying that "orders remain strong in the fourth quarter, when
sales typically show a 20% growth from the third quarter." Optical Cable
plans to report results for its fiscal third quarter ended July 31, 1997 by
the end of the month.

<BR><BR>
<B>O</B>ptical <B>C</B>able <B>C</B>orporation manufactures and markets a broad range of fiber
optic cables for "high bandwidth" transmission of data, video and audio
communications over moderate distances.  <B>O</B>ptical <B>C</B>able <B>C</B>orporation's cables
can be used both indoors and outdoors and utilize a tight-buffered coating
that protects the optical fiber.

<BR><BR>
<B>Note:</B>  This news release contains certain forward looking statements that
are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those projected or forecasted.  Such risks and
uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those disclosed in the
Company's Annual Report and Form 10-K for fiscal year 1996.

 <h2> Optical Cable CEO Comfortable With 3Q<BR> FY97 Net Views</h2>
</center>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR><BR>


<B>(Dow Jones - August 15, 1997)</B> Chief Executive <B>R</B>obert <B>K</B>opstein said he was "very comfortable" with analysts’ earnings estimates of 23 cents a share for the fiscal year because the company is coming off record-high sales in the third quarter and is heading into a fourth quarter that is typically the company’s strongest period.
<BR><BR>
<B>S</B>uch results for the year ending in October would represent 21% earnings growth over fiscal 1996 for the fiber-optic cable maker.
<BR><BR>
<B>K</B>opstein also told Dow Jones he is "more than comfortable" with estimates the company will earn between 5 cents and 6 cents a share in the third quarter ended in July.
<BR><BR>
<B>I</B>n fact, he said, those estimates may be conservative.
<BR><BR>
<B>T</B>he company, which posted net income of 5 cents a share in third quarter of 1996, expects to report results for the latest third quarter by the end of the month.
<BR><BR>
<B>K</B>opstein said third-quarter sales jumped 32% to $14.2 million from $10.8 million a year ago and were up 34% over the second quarter.  That performance surpassed the Roanoke, Va., fiber optical cable manufacturer’s internal projections by 5%.
<BR><BR>
<B>F</B>urthermore, orders remain strong in the fourth quarter, when sales typically show 20% growth from the third quarter, he said.
<BR><BR>
<B>T</B>he growing demand for fiber-optic cable, particularly for the extra-rugged cable the company makes, has <B>K</B>opstein expecting improved profitability.
At the same time, he sees increased visibility for the company since two research firms recently began covering it.
<BR><BR>
<B>A</B>lso boosting his enthusiasm: <B>O</B>ptical <B>C</B>able’s recently expanded manufacturing plant; the company’s absence of long-term debt; and expectation that selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales  will continue
to drop.
<BR><BR>
<B>T</B>he company has been profitable since its inception as an S Corporation in 1987.  It went public in April 1996 and posted a 26% operating margin during that fiscal year.
<BR><BR>
<B>T</B>he worldwide market for fiber-optic cable, estimated at $5.9 billion in 1996, is rising about 20% a year, and <B>O</B>ptical <B>C</B>able is focusing on one of the fastest growing segments: supplying cable used over moderate distances (less than 10 miles) to connect local area networks, telephone company local loops and cable TV systems, according to the company and analysts.
<BR><BR>
<B>K</B>opstein believes <B>O</B>ptical <B>C</B>able’s rugged, easy-to-install and easy-to-remove cable will allow the company to unseat Seicor, a joint venture between Siemens AG and Corning Inc. (GLW), as the leader in that market.
<BR><BR>
<B>T</B>he cable, which has a coating that protects the optical fiber indoors or outdoors, is for "high bandwidth" transmissions of data, video and audio communications.

 <h2> CEO Sees Boost From Japan Market Entry</h2>
</center>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR><BR>



<B>(Dow Jones - August 15, 1997)</B> <B>O</B>ptical <B>C</B>able’s recent break into the Japanese market will buttress sales for commercial and securities applications,  Chief Executive <B>K</B>opstein said. Other markets in the Far East and South America also are fast-growing he said.
<BR><BR>
<B>I</B>nternational sales accounted for about 27% of the company’s $45 million total for fiscal 1996 and so far this year have comprised nearly a third of sales.
<BR><BR>
<B>"W</B>e’ve been gaining ground internationally, "<B>K</B>opstein said.
<BR><BR>
<B>H</B>e sees increasing demand for the company’s extra-rugged, or  military-style, cable for use in guardless security systems, such as those used in prisons, or by broadcasters, as higher quality pictures and digital transmission become standard.
<BR><BR>
<B>O</B>ptical <B>C</B>able products have been used in winter and summer Olympics and other sporting events, and national political conventions.
<BR><BR>
<B>S</B>hares of the company’s thinly-traded stock closed Thursday at 15  -  65 times projected earnings for fiscal 1997.  <B>K</B>opstein, named Virginia’s Entrepreneur of the Year in 1997 for technology in a program sponsored by Ernst & Young, took the company public himself and owns 93% of the 38.6 million shares outstanding.
<BR><BR>
<B>T</B>he stock’s high valuation is one reason Soundview Financial Group analyst Chandan Sarkar, one of two researchers who recently picked up coverage, is recommending a short-term hold on the shares.  <B>O</B>ptical <B>C</B>able’s fundamentals, however, have him rating the company a long-term buy.
<BR><BR>
<B>A</B>nthony <B>T</B>ucker  Inc., which began coverage Aug. 7, also issued a buy recommendation and reported a 12-month price target of 18.
<BR><BR>
<B>T</B>he upbeat third quarter expectations is good news after <B>O</B>ptical  <B>C</B>able’s second quarter.
<BR><BR>
<B>S</B>hares hit  a 52-weed low of 7 1/8 June 6 after the company reported second-quarter net income fell 5.4% to $1.3 million, or 4 cents a share, from $1.4 million in pro-forma earnings a year ago.
<BR><BR>
<B>N</B>et Sales in the second quarter rose a 4.5% to $10.6 million but a slowdown in the European market was blamed for a 6.6% drop in international sales.
<BR><BR>
<B>K</B>opstein at the time blamed the day’s volatility ( the stock eventually closed at 9, off 7/8, or 9%)  on that earnings report and efforts by short sellers to drive share prices down.
<BR><BR>
<B>O</B>ptical <B>C</B>able has a huge short interest ratio - 967,920 shares as of July 15 with a short interest ratio of 22 days, the 19th highest ratio on the NASDAQ  Stock Market.  That is, it would take that many days to cover the short interest if trading continued at the average daily volume of the month.  In a short sale, the investor sells borrowed shares in hopes of replacing them later at a lower cost and pocketing the difference in price.
<BR><BR>
<B>T</B>he stock recently was up ½ at 15 ½, and the shares have gained more than 66% since hitting the low in June.
<BR><BR>
<B>F</B>or his part, <B>K</B>opstein still sees the shares as undervalued, saying he expects their price to hit 25 in the near term.  "In the entire year since we went public," he said, "I’ve not sold any of my 36 million shares."  Several weeks after the company went public at $10 a share, the stock soared to $136, before a 2-for-1 stock split.

 <h2>  Attention:  Shareholders in  "OCCF"</h2>
</center>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR><BR>
<B>W</B>e are pleased to tell you that the quarter has just been completed with
a new quarterly record being set for sales and a new monthly record high
for sales was also set in July.  Sales for the third quarter was
approximately $14.3 million versus $10.86 million in the same period last
year and $10.6 million for the second quarter.  Business levels continue
to strengthen with the fourth quarter typically being our strongest
quarter of the year.  Please find attached some of our recent press
releases for information purposes.
<BR><BR>
<B>O</B>n a more serious note, I have not responded in quite a while on the
"Short Interest" in "OCCF".  As reported in several earlier press
releases, the few large funds that control most of the "Short Interest"
continue to manipulate the stock price.  It is the value of your stock
that they are playing with.  Presently they have sold 967,920 shares that
they do not own, depressing significantly the value of your shares.
Remember, "short interest" selling means that someone has borrowed your
shares without your knowledge, then sold them without your knowledge, and
is hoping to buy them back cheap and then return them to your account.
Several stock brokers have suggested that the only way that we can drive
the "Short Interest" manipulators out of "OCCF" is to have all
shareholders request their shares back in certificate form.  Presently
2.41 million shares are at brokerage firms in street-name and 265,000
shares are in the original stock certificates.  If your "OCCF" stock is
in an account at your stock brokers office and you wish to assist in
eliminating the "Short Interest" manipulators and to increase the value
of your shares, please try the following:
<UL>
<LI> Call your stock broker's office and inform them that you wish to
have your "OCCF" shares returned to you in certificate form immediately.

<LI>  Watch what happens to the stock price as your shares are returned to
you in certificate  form.
</UL>
<B>W</B>e shall monitor the process and send out additional newsletters
approximately every two weeks so that you can stay informed with how many
shares are in certificates versus in street-name at stock broker offices.
 As the number of shares in street name gradually declines, the "Short
Interest" manipulators will be forced to buy back that 967,920 shares.
Talk to your friends at home or work and let them watch and see what
happens when shareholders take the initiative to drive these underhanded
manipulators out of "OCCF".  This process might take a little while to
complete, so be patient, inform others, and wait for the next update.
<BR><BR>
<B>F</B>or your information, here is an approximate background on when, at what
price range, and how much stock the "Short Interest" manipulators have
sold to depress the value in "OCCF".
<BR><BR>
<PRE>
	DATE		NUMBER OF SHARES
	SOLD		  SOLD "SHORT"		PRICE RANGE
        ----------------------------------------------------
	June 1996	   568,000		 $20 to $30
	August 1996	   157,000		 $18 to $20
	September 1996	    30,000		 $16 to $18
	March 1997	    65,000		 $15 to $17
	April 1997	   165,000		 $12 to $13
</pre>
<BR><BR>
<B>A</B>t what price would you be willing to sell your shares back to these
"Short Interest" manipulators?  A good question that only you can answer.
 Remember, it is like you loaning someone a stick to beat you up with and
then asking yourself what happened.  The "battle" has just begun and with
the help of our 6,500 shareholders, victory shall be ever so sweet to
you.
<BR><BR>
<B>Yours truly,
<BR><BR>

Robert Kopstein, President/CEO

<h2 align=center>Overview</h2>

<p><b>
Welcome to Wheeling Corrugating Company, a division of Wheeling-
Pittsburgh Steel Corporation.
</b></p><p><b>
Headquartered in Wheeling, West Virginia, Wheeling Corrugating is one of 
America’s leading fabricators of roll formed products for agricultural, 
construction, highway and bridge building markets.
</b></p><p><b>

Since 1890, when the company was founded by Alexander Glass, Wheeling 
Corrugating has grown to 14 facilities in 11 states.  Much of the reason for 
the company’s success centers on the same principles practiced by Glass, 
principles that are etched in steel and have stood the test of time:
<ul>
<li>Build a strong base around quality roofing and siding;
<li>Broaden the product line to meet the evolving needs of the marketplace;
<li>Improve and upgrade through capital investments;
<li>And, grow through careful acquisition.
</ul>
</b></p><p><b>
Today, these principles, backed by a team of talented and dedicated men and 
women, have kept Wheeling Corrugating a true American industrial 
success story.
</b></p>

<h2 align=center>Facilities—Mill Connected</h2>

<p><b>
Wheeling Corrugating’s 14 plants are strategically located throughout the 
country.  This ensures personalized customer service and quick delivery to 
the job site.
</b></p><p><b>
Unlike other manufacturers, Wheeling Corrugating controls every aspect of 
the products’ manufacture, from the making of the steel to the final product.
</b></p><p><b>
Since Wheeling Corrugating is connected to Wheeling-Pittsburgh 
Steel, it can ensure its products are made to its exacting specifications.
</b></p><p><b>
Wheeling Corrugating uses both galvanized and full-hard cold rolled steel.  
But the vast majority of its products are made from galvanized steel 
produced at Wheeling-Pittsburgh’s Martins Ferry, Ohio, Plant.
</b></p><p><b>
The galvanizing process involves applying a coat of molten zinc to the steel 
for corrosion resistance.  It’s this protection that makes Wheeling 
Corrugating’s products so long-lasting.
</b></p><p><b>
Once Wheeling Corrugating receives the steel, its facilities take over the 
process.
</b></p>

<h2 align=center>Products</h2>

<p><b>
Wheeling Corrugating’s products are well known and well respected from 
coast to coast.  Here’s an overview of the company’s products:
</b></p>

<ul>
<li><h3>Painted Roofing and Siding</h3>

<p><b>
<img align=left width=150 height=98 border=1 hspace=10
src="images/painted-roofing-siding.jpg">
The Company’s painted roofing and siding is a time proven building 
material.  There are four distinctive profiles of the product known as 
Channeldrain&#174, Paneldrain&#174, Centurydrain&#174 and Channeldrain
 2000&#174.  And each 
comes in a variety of colors.
</b></p><p><b>
The painted roofing and siding is the number one seller throughout 
America, year after year.  From coast to coast, all types of structures, from 
commercial to agricultural to residential, are covered with these attractive 
products.
</b></p><p><b>
The galvanized steel used in this product receives a dried in place seal 
coating that resists corrosion even more, a protective step often omitted by 
price-driven manufacturers.  This coat also enables better primer coat 
adhesion.
</b></p><p><b>
The primer coat is then applied which provides outstanding top coat paint 
adhesion in addition to adding another layer of corrosion protection.
</b></p><p><b>
After this process, the top coat paint is applied—a paint which has the 
highest gloss and best color retention in the industry, as well as excellent 
acid rain and chalking resistance.
</b></p><p><b>
The roofing and siding then undergoes a special roll-forming process, as 
does most of the company’s other products.  It’s the roll-form that gives the 
product its extreme strength and crisp appearance.
</b></p><p><b>
The product is then cut to length and shipped to the customer who will use it 
in a wide variety of construction products.
</b></p>

<li><h3>Unpainted Galvanized Roofing and Siding</h3>

<p><b>
<img align=left width=150 height=98 hspace=10 border=1
src="images/unpainted-roofing-siding.jpg">
There are three types of unpainted roofing and siding:  Barnmaster&#174, 
for 
strength on everyday, economical projects; Industrial Siding, for heavy duty 
use to protect against rough weather and rough abuse; and 5-V Roofing, 
tough enough to handle light commercial applications, handsome enough 
for residential installations.
</b></p><p><b>
As point of interest, in recent years there has been a dramatic increase in 
homebuilders using both painted and unpainted roofing for residential use.  
</b></p>

<li><h3>Composite Floor Deck/Super-Bond&#174</h3>

<p><b>
<img align=left width=150 height=98 border=1 hspace=10
src="images/super-bond.jpg">
There are three styles of Super-Bond&#174.  These products provide a
heavy-duty working platform for pouring concrete on to create a floor.
</b></p><p><b>
The floor deck’s deep, ribbed profiles and special embossments interlock 
with the concrete as it cures, combing the best of both materials into a 
single, tough-working building unit.
</b></p><p><b>
Super-Bond floor deck is economical as well as practical.  It eliminates the 
need for costly, time-consuming, labor intensive construction of temporary 
wood forms and shoring.
</b></p><p><b>
Wheeling Corrugating’s floor deck is often found in low and high rise office 
buildings and other multi-level buildings.
</b></p>

<li><h3>Steel Roof Deck</h3>

<p><b>
<img align=left width=150 height=98 border=1 hspace=10
src="images/steel-roof-deck.jpg">
The company’s roof deck is a product line well known to engineers and 
architects as a versatile construction material compatible with a wide 
variety of designs.  Roof deck is often used by contractors because it is 
lightweight, strong, economical and easy to install.
</b></p><p><b>
You could easily find this product in schools, theaters, auditoriums, malls, 
supermarkets and similar structures.
</b></p>

<li><h3>Form Deck</h3>

<p><b>
<img align=left width=150 height=98 border=1 hspace=10
src="images/form-deck.jpg">
This versatile product is used as a strong base for pouring both concrete 
floors and roofing.
</b></p><p><b>
One style of form deck is called Tensilform&#174.  Tensilform&#174 is ideally suited 
as a permanent steel base for lightweight concrete floor slabs.  
</b></p><p><b>
Another style is known as Tensilvent&#174.  Tensilvent&#174 comes with drying slots 
in the steel that accelerate concrete drying time, used in roofing applications 
with lightweight insulating concrete.
</b></p><p><b>
Where form deck is to be a permanent part of a structure, the product is 
galvanized.  Where permanence is not essential, uncoated steel panels are 
used.
</b></p><p><b>
Form deck primarily is used in schools, warehouses, and low and high rise 
office complexes.
</b></p>

<li><h3>Bridge Form</h3>

<p><b>
<img align=left width=150 height=98 border=1 hspace=10
src="images/bridge-form.jpg">
Bridge form is a heavy duty steel system for forming concrete bridge deck 
slabs quickly, safely and economically.  Bridge form is fabricated to 
individual specifications from high strength, galvanized steel.
</b></p><p><b>
The concrete is poured over the bridge form to a permanent strong bridge 
deck.  And, because all work is done from the top side, the bridge form 
provides a safe, sure-footed working area.
</b></p>

<li><h3>Galvanized Sheet & Coil for Culvert Pipe</h3>

<p><b>
<img align=left width=150 height=98 border=1 hspace=10
src="images/culvert.jpg">
Wheeling Corrugating sells galvanized steel to companies that make culvert 
pipe.  The Martins Ferry plant applies an extra thick coating of zinc to 
heavy gauge steel for culvert pipe manufacturing.
</b></p><p><b>
Steel for culvert use must be durable and long-lasting since the pipe will be 
used underground beneath and along highways.  It also is used for sanitary 
sewer systems and other similar applications.

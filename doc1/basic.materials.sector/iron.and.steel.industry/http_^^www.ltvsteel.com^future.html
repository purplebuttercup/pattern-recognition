         <P>The steel industry of the future will be far different
         from the steel industry of today. Technological advances and
         the opening of global markets have already made the
         traditional steel industry paradigms obsolete. By not
         allowing the past to restrict our view of the future, LTV is
         adopting new technologies and business practices to remain
         an industry leader for the long-term future.</P>

         In 1995, less than 7 percent of all U.S.-produced steel was
         exported. This indicates tremendous room for growth. While
         we currently supply flat rolled steel to our U.S. customers
         with foreign operations, and we also serve many foreign
         automakers operating in the U.S., these efforts will expand
         further:</P>
         
         <UL>
            <LI>All of our flat rolled steel and tin mill plants are
            now certified under the International Standards
            Organization's ISO 9000 program, giving us the tools
            necessary to compete more effectively in the global
            market.
            
            <LI>Currently we operate two international liaison
            offices in Tokyo and Mexico City. We will open offices in
            more markets as we grow.
            
            <LI>We will continue to aggressively pursue international
            joint ventures that give us a competitive edge in foreign
            markets. For more on LTV joint ventures in the U.S. and
            abroad, see <A HREF="/jointventures.html">Joint
            Ventures</A>.
         </UL>

         in Process</FONT><BR>
         
         The steel industry has become extremely competitive, and LTV
         is determined to stay a step ahead by not limiting ourselves
         in any way. An excellent example of this type of thinking is
         the Trico Steel Company, our
         <A HREF="/jointventures.html">joint venture</A> with
         Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd. of Japan and British Steel
         plc. Opening in early 1997, this flat rolled minimill plant
         in Decatur, Alabama, will serve the expanding hot rolled
         steel market in the southeastern U.S. More important, it
         signals our intention to fight the competitive attack on our
         core business by the new breed of flat rolled minimills.

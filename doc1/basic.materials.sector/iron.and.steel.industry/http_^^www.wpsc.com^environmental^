At Wheeling-Pittsburgh, protecting the environment is a top priority.  
Two initiatives this year demonstrate this commitment.  
</b></p>

<p><b>
The first of these initiatives is a 10-month old acid recycling program.  
It was for this
program that Wheeling-Pittsburgh, together with American Iron Oxide Co. 
(AMROX), has won this year's prestigious "Three Rivers Environmental Award for 
Business-Environmental Stewardship."
</b></p><p><b>
Going beyond what is required of them by federal law, the company has 
been sending one million gallons per month of spent hydrochloric acid or 
“pickle liquor” (used to clean steel of surface rust and scale) to  
AMROX.  AMROX cleans and regenerates 100 percent of 
the used pickle liquor before it is sent back to Wheeling-Pittsburgh's 
plants to be used again.
</b></p><p><b>
“Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel is demonstrating true corporate responsibility to 
the local community through its acid recycling initiative,” said U.S. 
Representative Bob Ney of Ohio, adding, “This effort goes above and 
beyond what is required of them to meet the current environmental standard 
and is good for everybody involved.”  
</b></p><p><b>
Used acid from steelmaking 
represents the largest volume of hazardous material disposed of in West 
Virginia’s landfills, according to a DEP sanitary engineer.

</b></p>

<p><b>
Wheeling-Pittsburgh's second large-scale environmental program this year is 
an electric and steam producing cogeneration facility at their South
Plant in Mingo Junction, Ohio.
</b></p><p><b>

When completed late next year, the cogeneration facility will generate 
low-cost electric power by 
burning the gas created during the ironmaking process at the South
Plant's Number 5 Blast Furnace.  The molten iron produced by the furnace
is combined with other materials to produce steel.  Currently, some of
the gas is reused by the company to produce steam, but most of the gas is 
cleaned and burned off into the atmosphere under federal guidelines.
</b></p><p><b>

Because the facility will create power for Wheeling-Pittsburgh, there will
be less need to burn fossil fuels to produce power, resulting in less
sulfur dioxide emissions into the atmosphere.
</b></p><p><b>

The cogeneration facility is being financed, constructed, and operated
by the Houston-based Air Liquide America, part of the world's largest 
industrial gas
organization, Air Liquide, S.A., headquartered in Paris, France.

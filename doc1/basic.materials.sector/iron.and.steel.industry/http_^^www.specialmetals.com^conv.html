<p align="center">With its new press capabilities, Special
Metals, a world leader in superalloy technology, expands its
conversion capabilties. In addition to superalloys, new materials
can be processed under contract with other metal producers. These
include: Nickel Alloys Titanium Alloys Stainless Steels Tool
Steels Carbon &amp; Alloy steels Other Metals (Please call

<h2 align="center"><em><strong>Advantages:</strong></em></h2>

<p>Special Metals is now able to offer even greater advantages in
forging capacity, speed and power.</p>

<p><br>
<em><strong>Product Quality</strong></em> </p>

<p>Special Metals' new press holds tighter dimensional
tolerances. Its unique combination of power and speed allows
Special Metals to produce superior metallurgical structure, with
an improved uniformity of structure from surface to center.</p>

<p><br>
<em><strong>Fast Turnaround</strong></em> </p>

<p>Special Metals now offers some of the fastest production
forging available. Fewer reheating operations are required,
allowing the product to be produced in much less time. This in
turn allows faster processing of orders, large and small, to meet
critical deadlines.</p>

<p><br>
<em><strong>Productivity</strong></em> </p>

<p>This new process enables SMC to handle larger pieces faster
and to closer tolerances.</p>

<p><br>
<em><strong>Capacity</strong></em> </p>

<p>With two presses, Special Metals has the capacity to produce
your order to your specifications, whether it's one piece or
several hundrerd tons. SMC can process it on time, with improved
yields and product quality.</p>

<p><br>
<em><strong>Responsiveness</strong></em> </p>

<p>Conversion work is a major focus for Special Metals, and with
our recent expansion, we can now provide more forging capacity
than any other metals producer. Lead times are reduced, requiring
less time from order to delivery. Special Metal's service
responsiveness, recognized as unique in the industry, is now
complemented with even faster production turnaround, while
maintaining the highest product integrity.</p>

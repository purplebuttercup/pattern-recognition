<P>Around 1944, the gas turbine engine developed by Air Commodore Whittle
in England
was brought to the United States, and General
Electric started producing the I-40 engine.  High temperature alloys at that
time were rather
limited, and Hastalloy-B and Vitallium were
probably among the first materials used for turbine buckets.
<P>
<P>Utica Drop Forge and Tool Corp., with a national reputation for its high

quality
precision hand tools, was one of the first companies to
forge buckets for the GE engine.  Other forgers included Steel Improvement
and Forge Co.,
(SIFCO) and Thompson Ramo Wooldridge,
(TRW).
<P>
<P>Dr. Falih  N. Darmara had joined Drop Forge as Chief Metallurgist in 
1941 after
moving east from the copper industry in Utah where
he had worked since receiving his Masters and Doctorate degrees at MIT and

Harvard.  Primarily
responsible for the metallurgy of the
hand tools, he set up their first metallurgy laboratory and introduced a
process for induction
hardening of cutter blades. He became
interested as well in the challenges of high temperature alloys with respect
to their chemistry,
forgability and properties.
<P>
<P>Falih, known to his friends and cohorts as "Doc," left Drop Forge in about

1944 on
leave of absence for The Lewis Flight Propulsion
Laboratory of NACA, (The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics  --
 now NASA) in
Cleveland, OH.  At NACA he set up their
first high temperature alloy development section for evaluating existing
alloys and developing
improved materials.  He believed that alloys
depending on reactive elements such as titanium and aluminum for precipitation

hardening could
not be reliably made using conventional
air melting techniques, and that such alloys must be melted, refined and
poured under vacuum to
realize their full potential.
<P>
<P>He interested the writer who was working in NACA's piston ring and cylinder

barrel
section, in joining his group in 1945 to build a small
vacuum furnace to melt alloy samples.  A small furnace was designed and built

using two
Curtiss-Wright air-cooled engine cylinder barrels
welded end-to-end as the shell.  Crucibles with a capacity of about 150 grams

were slip cast from
beryllium oxide and resistance heated
by a wound coil of molybdenum wire.  The chamber was evacuated with a mechanical

pump
backing a three-stage all-glass diffusion pump. 
There was no capability to pour the melt into a mold, and after  a heat was
 made, it  was  frozen
in the crucible  which  had  to be
destroyed to reclaim the solidified casting.  Despite the furnace limitations,

several heats of alloys
which were then considered "high
temperature" were made and examined metallographically during late 1945 and
1946.  It is not 
known what if any mechanical testing
was performed on these heats.
<P>
<P>Doc left NACA in the fall of 1946 for an advisory position  at the United

States Steel
Corp. in New Jersey until his return to Drop Forge
as Director of Research in 1949.  By this time the company was actively involved

in forging gas
turbine blades and buckets in their
Turbine Parts Division.  Doc reported directly to the President, Willis V.

Daugherty, and was
responsible not only for the metallurgical
well being of the Tool and Turbine Parts Division, but also for the evaluation

and implementation
of new processes which could improve
quality and/or productivity.  Resistance  heated upsetters and slow acting

presses for forging high
temperature alloys were two of the many
processes he introduced.  He became Assistant to the President in 1950 and
Vice president in
1952.
<P>
<P>During this period, the turbine  parts business expanded rapidly due
to the advent of
the Korean war, and the company produced parts
for not only GE but Curtiss-Wright and Pratt and Whitney.  The company's forging
facilities expanded into a
plant in Whitestown, and an extensive
blade machining facility was set up in Clayville.  One of Pratt and Whitney's
engines,
the J-48, used Waspaloy  for
its bucket material, and this alloy, which
has a fascinating legendary history, was supplied to Drop Forge by Allegheny

Ludlum, Universal
Cyclops and International Nickel as 2"
bar stock from ten-ton air-melted heats.  The stress rupture specification
for the as-forged product
was 40 hours at 32,500 psi and 1500
deg. F.  A continual state of crisis existed in the Turbine Parts Division,
since it was not possible
to get consistent properties from heat-to-heat from the air-melted stock.
 Ten-ton heats were
frequently rejected due to their inability to meet the 40 hour stress rupture

spec., and
this proved not only costly for all parties, but raised havoc with production

planning.
<P>
<P>Doc felt that the wide variations in the properties of the air melted
heats was due to the
inability to hold the amounts and ratio of the
titanium and aluminum in the heats due to random oxidation.  He recommended
to Mr. Daugherty
that Drop Forge consider setting up
a vacuum melting facility to get into the production of improved materials.
<P>
<P>In this immediate post World War II period the Air Force frequently provided

funding
for the procurement of production equipment for
installation in plants producing parts for the military.  Much of the forging

equipment and ancillary 
facilities  for  the Turbine Parts 
Division of  Drop Forge  had  been funded by such facilities contracts. 
With the support of Mr.
Daugherty and the Norris family, (which
owned Drop Forge), Doc pushed for, and succeeded in obtaining funds through
an Appendix to
one such contract in 1951 for the
procurement and installation of a 50 pound and a 200 pound vacuum induction

melting furnace. 
The total amount allotted amounted to
$135,000. This would give him the equipment necessary to pursue his theories

regarding the
potential benefits of vacuum melting.
<P><BR>

Lab</A></STRONG></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<P>In late 1951, Doc contacted the writer who had returned to the Fairchild

Engine and
Aircraft Corp. after leaving NACA, and we met for
dinner at the Barclay in NYC.  He proceeded to describe his plans for setting
up a laboratory
operation with the aim of evaluating vacuum
melting as a viable method of producing high temperature alloys with improved
and consistent
properties.  He indicated that the location
and facilities would be somewhat crude with respect to those we had been
used to at NACA, but
that Drop Forge management and the
Air force were in full support of the venture. Doc has always had a persuasive

charm, and after
minimal deliberation, the writer accepted
his offer to join Drop Forge to design, procure and install the vacuum furnaces

and ancillary
equipment.
<P>
<P>On March 17, 1952, the writer started work with Doc in setting up
the lab at the
Clayville plant.  As mentioned above, Drop Forge had
moved its blade machining operation to a large vacant textile mill in Clayville.

 Sophisticated
broaches, automatic grinders etc. occupied
the most recently built (1920s) portion of the complex, but the original
three story mill building
(circa 1824) on the northwest corner
of the property was vacant.  This structure, with 3' thick stone walls and
12 pane double-hung
windows, typical of many such textile plants
in the area, was available to house the lab and offices.  A brick structure
at right angles would be
used for the machine shop, and another
brick building close-by would be the melt shop.
<P>
<P>The first item of business was the final design of the 50 lb. and 200
lb. furnaces which
were to be built by Distillation Products Industries
in Rochester (soon to become Consolidated Vacuum).  It appeared that the
earliest that delivery
could be expected would be in the spring
of 1953.  After considerable review of the quoted equipment costs and

negotiations with DPI, it
was determined that cuts could be made
to free up enough money so that a smaller 6 lb. furnace could be built by
us on a crash basis
without exceeding the budgeted amounts on
the Appendix.
<P>
<P>The design of the 6 pounder started on or about April 1, 1952 and the
drawings were
completed by early May.  Utica Steam Engine built
the shell, base plate and cover, DPI furnished the pumps and vacuum parts,
Doc scavenged a 50
KW generator from somewhere, and the
rest was built in-house by Ray Decker, our versatile machinist, and Si Batson,

our mechanic who
could "cobble up" most anything from
bits and pieces lying around the old mill.  We learned how to leak check
by squirting acetone on
the suspect areas  and  watching  for a 
minuscule rise  on the pirani  gage.  (we couldn't afford a leak checker),
and large quantities of
glyptol were used to plug up leaks, (duct
seal wasn't invented yet).  The induction coil was rebuilt three times until
we got a turns ratio that
tuned efficiently, but finally we were
able to make the first heat, AA-1 on August 26, 1952, only five months after
the start of
design.
<P>
<P>There was an abundance of scrap Waspaloy available as raw material in
the form of 2"
bar stock from heats that hadn't met stress rupture
specs., and  campaigns were run wherein this scrap was remelted and poured
into tapered copper
molds.  After removing the hot tops,
these ingots were fullered and flattened by Drop Forge and forged into J-48

buckets.  Various
metallurgical treatments were tried including
deoxidation with carbon and the addition of discrete amounts of titanium
and aluminum to adjust
the hardener ratio.  Stress rupture tests
were performed on the forged product on the Dennison Leeds machines Doc got
from England,
set up in the lab over the summer and run
by Kenny Vincent who came over from Drop Forge.  Wet chemistries were run
by Mert
Harrington in his new lab set up on benches
bought knocked-down from Sears and put together by the whole crew on weekends.


Metallography was done by Bob Kniffen and Erwin
Deimal in a modest lab with sinks obtained from a garage sale in Whitesboro.
<P>
<P>The stress rupture results were truly amazing.  Even by just remelting

material which
had originally failed the 40 hour spec. we were able
to get rupture lives of over 200 hours, and   what was equally gratifying
was the consistency of
properties in the remelted product.  Doc
was in close contact with P&amp;W, and Win Sharp often visited Clayville
to follow the progress.  It
did not take Pratt long to issue PO No.
449769, Req. No. 782624-A for "24 J-48 Blade Forgings coined to size from
vacuum cast PWA
675-B Waspaloy" on November 13,
1952, (just 2 1/2 months after the first heat) .  This order was filled,
one heat per blade
commencing on December 31, 1952 and completed
in January 1953.  Pratt was nearly ecstatic with the properties of the resultant

blades and more
orders followed for similar product.  It then
became a matter of "how much can be produced, and how fast".
<P>
<P>The 50 lb. furnace was installed in the late spring of 1953 and the 200

pounder
followed a couple of months later.  These furnaces, despite
early problems with pumping and crucibles, ( store-bought  monolithic) were

producing "double
or triple ingots" weighing 12 or 18
pounds from scrap Waspaloy by the end of the summer.  The Lab was a true

productive unit,
albeit small.
<P>
<P>A few words are in order regarding the rest of the Lab's activities during

this period. 
Number 1 furnace was kept busy evaluating new
melting practices and developing potentially new alloys.  The first heats
of what became known as
Udimet 500 were melted during this
period.  Doc was also interested in the dynamics of the forging process and
had  brought over
Tony Notaro to run forging tests on a small
drop hammer instrumented with accelerometers and strain gages to monitor
the stress-strain curve
during the forging process.  He was
also interested in pursuing the potentials of powder metallurgy, particularly
in making intricate
shapes such as milling cutters from
carbides, and he hired Harry Hamjian, a powder metallurgist at NACA in the
summer of 1952 to
set up a powder lab.  Harry made some
impressive products in a hot press set up by Jack Haggerty who joined us
about that time, and he
and Doc obtained patents on some of
the techniques.  Harry was switched from the powder work to run the vacuum

melting production
after the 50 pounder came on line
because of the demand for the Waspaloy product.  Ray Zoeckler came over from
Drop Forge and
set up an experimental electrochemical
machining device to finish blade surfaces.   Roger Loofburrow was hired from

Merck to set up
the Spec. Lab. with a coffin-like
spectrograph,  Ray Ermacor joined us to help with a library and handle

procurement, Bob
Kreimeyer, Ted Hughes, Ray Kluska worked
with the furnaces, Gil Dodge joined Kenny in the creep room, Ed Rice was
our first draftsman and
Jean Edick became Doc's secretary.
<P>
<P>In addition, Doc retained Dr. E. S. (Gene) Machlin who had worked with
us at NACA,
(where he started work on his dislocation theories)
to assist in alloy development. Dr. Max Gensamer was also retained to assist
in mechanical
metallurgy.
<P>
<P>Typical of the crises that confronted the operation during the first year
was the relative
lack of water for cooling of the furnaces.  The water
supply for the Clayville Plant originated in a reservoir on the west side
of the valley.  During
winter and spring, there was sufficient water
to supply the town of Clayville plus the Drop Forge operations, but the summer
of 1953 proved
to be very dry.  The first operation to be
curtailed was the vacuum melting, which didn't set well with Doc.  To keep

running, a well was
drilled close to the furnace building, and
within a week an abundant vein was tapped which provided a real artesian
well with water
spouting a foot or more above the 6" casing. 
This was capped and provided all the water we needed from then on,  --  we
even let the
Machining Division use some of the surplus.
<P>
<P>Even before No. 2 and No. 3 furnaces were up and running, Doc felt that
the potential
of vacuum melting was such that more productive
equipment would be required.  As Supplement IX to an existing  Air Force

contract, two 500
pound furnaces were included along with
support equipment.  The total amount for this equipment totaled $675,000.
 This supplement was
initiated in February 1953, accompanied
by letters of support from C. R. Skinner of P&amp;W and F. P. Holter of

Curtis-Wright. A letter from
Mr. Skinner to Mr. Daugherty states".....
Our engine testing results indicate that a superior blade can be produced
by this process, and we
have entered our order 527600
with you for 10,000 forgings for the J48 engine which will require 30,000
pounds of vacuum
melted metal......." Later he
states"......Complementing the above program which has resulted in approval
of these forgings for
production engines, we are now
most actively pursuing potential applications of this vacuum cast material
to all models of our J57
engine....".
<P>
<P>Design work started on these 500 pound furnaces, (soon to become 1000
pounders by
the time they were built).  F. J. Stokes Corp. in
Philadelphia, PA was selected to build and install them.  It soon became
apparent that the
Clayville location was not large enough to
accommodate these furnaces, and a portion of the old Oneida Bleachery in
New York Mills was
selected as a satisfactory site for the
expanding operation.
<P><CENTER><STRONG><EM><A NAME="chapter3">Chapter 3  --  The Move to New
York
Mills</A></EM></STRONG></CENTER>
  
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<P>The design of the furnaces for the new plant was somewhat unique.  It
was evident that
we could no longer efficiently utilize 18 lb. tapered
ingots from heats as large as 1000 pounds.  One alternative was to pour two

ingots of about 500
pounds apiece (the old S-420 molds),
but these would have to be forged and rolled into barstock by an outside
company.  Another was
to pour 48" diameter rings centrifugally
and cut them into wedge shaped pieces for subsequent forging.  To cover both

bets, the furnaces
were designed to handle either method. 
Because of the mass of the centrifugal caster mold and poured ring, the casters

had to be mounted
on massive concrete  piers. The
caster shafts protruded through the walls of the 8' diameter stationary covers

which were affixed
to the caster piers and sealed with 2'
diameter rotating seals.  The furnaces in 8' diameter by 8' long water cooled

shells had to move on
standard railroad rails to meet the
stationary covers.  The 6-10" booster pumps were hung on the sides of the
shells, and the
capacitors were located on platforms at the rear
of the shells.  Cooling water and electric power were supplied via catenary

loops, and the waste
water flowed into the rail channels and
back to the recirculating system.
<P>
<P>Preliminary design work started in early 1953 and continued throughout
the year.  A
major crisis arose when Ajax Magnathermic
withdrew their quotation to build the induction furnaces  based on their
feelings that  "there was
no future for vacuum induction melting
which would warrant their undertaking design of such large equipment."  Tocco
in Ohio was
selected as an alternate.  The final quoted
amount for the two units complete with power supplies, pumps and casters
was about $359,000. 
Construction commenced in early 1954.
<P>
<P>While the new furnaces were being built at Stokes, work was underway to

remodel the
bleachery at New York Mills to accommodate both
the Clayville equipment, the new furnaces and a considerable list of new
shop and test equipment,
including a direct reading spectrograph. 
Some 44,000 square feet of production space and 10,000 square feet of offices
and labs were
involved. The move from Clayville
commenced in March and was finished by the end of April 1954.
<P>
<P>The first new furnace, No. 5, arrived from Stokes in August 1954 followed
soon
thereafter by its companion, No. 4.  (The numbering was
determined by the furnace location in the new melt shop).  There were the
usual startup problems,
the most severe being the need to
rework the 300 KW, 3000Hz supply from the capacitor rack to the induction
coil, but trial heats
were made during the fall of 1954, and by
December some 22 heats had been made in No. 5.  The 23rd and 24th heats were

centrifugally
cast 500 pound, 48" diameter rings.
<P>
<P>By early 1955, the plant was in full operation.  It was now known as The

Metals
Division of The Utica Drop Forge and Tool Corp. and
Doc was Vice President and General Manager.  The centrifugal castings had
not proven a viable
method of supplying forging stock due
to heavy circumferential carbide segregation.  It was therefore necessary
to go the
forging/bar-rolling route, and Latrobe Steel was the
primary conversion source, although other shops, including Vanadium Alloys
were also used.
<P>
<P>Scrap high temperature alloy was still the main raw material.  This scrap
was obtained
from low property air melted heats, hot tops from
our ingots, flashing and scrapped forged blades and blades retired from engines.

 This scrap
utilization was not only beneficial from the
raw material cost standpoint, but also because it salvaged critical elements
in alloys whose
chemistries were such that they could not be
recycled by air melting.  In fact this recycling aspect was a prime reason
why the Air Force was so
supportive of the process.  By
December 1954, over 143,000 pounds of Waspaloy scrap had been melted in No.
2 and No. 3
furnaces using 114,000 pounds of scrap,
or 80% of the total charged weight.
<P>
<P>With four furnaces in operation, having a total capacity of 180,000 lbs.
per month,
alloys other than Waspaloy, including M-252, the
Nimonics and our newly developed U-500 were added to the melt list.  GE-Lynn,

GE-Cincinatti,
Allison and Curtiss-Wright became end-use customers using Drop Forge as the
blade forging
source.  No. 1 furnace was in constant use on alloy and process development,
and
such techniques as shot pouring in vacuum were explored.  Vacuum melting
had become accepted
in the gas turbine industry as the
method to produce reliable blade material, and business was booming.
<P>
<P>It soon became apparent that the end of the scrap surplus was at hand,
and while there
would always be some 40% generated from hot
tops, flashing and bar ends, virgin melts must be considered.  This  brought
on another crisis as
we found that virgin heats did not produce
consistently high stress rupture properties.  Statistical analysis eventually

showed that the best
heats were the first melted in a new crucible
and that properties deteriorated as more heats were melted in a campaign.
 This led to the
discovery that trace amounts of boron and
zirconium were being leached from the new crucibles and giving the better

properties to the first
heats.  We did not know that the air melters had
consistently added these elements to their Waspaloy heats, and using this
scrap had automatically
provided enough to keep the properties
up.  The answer for the virgin heats, of course, was to add known quantities
of boron and
zirconium, which led to a crash program using
our new direct reading spectrograph and No. 1 Furnace to determine the optimum

amounts.
<P>
<P>As 1956 approached, it again became evident that the New York Mills plant
with its
2,400 pound total melt capacity operated by some
193 people would not be sufficient to produce the quantities of super alloys

projected in the next
few years, and it was again necessary
to consider new melting equipment.  Although No. 4 &amp; 5 were cranking
out record amounts of
material, they had one serious drawback 
--  the single frequency (3000 Hz) heated beautifully, but the "four-loop"
single phase power
supply did not stir well.  This necessitated
heating and cooling several times to adequately mix a heat before pouring,
which added
considerable time to the melt cycle.
<P>
<P>The  writer had read  of developments in  air melt  induction  equipment
by Dr. Dreyfus
at ASEA in Sweden wherein dual frequencies
were used  --  890 Hz for heating and 30 Hz for stirring.  These frequencies

could be
superimposed to give excellent temperature control
plus the ability to stir at any desired rate.  ASEA was contacted and visited
 us at New York
Mills, which resulted in a decision to explore
the use of their technique.  The writer spent the summer of 1956 at ASEA
in Vasteras, Sweden,
directing the preliminary design of a 5000
pound furnace, to be the largest VIM furnace in the world.
<P>
<P> At the same time, The Kelsey Hayes Co., with headquarters in Detroit,
MI was
negotiating to buy Drop Forge.  The purchase became
official in mid 1956, and as part of the agreement, the Metals Division of
Utica Drop Forge and
Tool Corp. would become the Metals
Division of Kelsey Hayes.  Plans included the immediate building of a separate

plant to house the
existing equipment from New York
Mills as well as the new 5000 pound furnace being designed.  A new forging
plant was also to be
constructed for Drop Forge on Halsey
Road in Whitestown, and at first it was proposed that the Metals Division
would be located
across the road and share the forge plant's
substation.  Doc would have absolutely no part of such an arrangement.  By
this time, sales had
been developed with other forge shops
and our customer and product base was expanding.  He felt that a plant in
close proximity to
Halsey Road would imply a "captive shop"
which would severely hamper his sales plans.  He literally "put his job on
the line" regarding this
decision. In a presentation "Proposed Metals
Division Expansion," November 1, 1956, Doc clearly  outlined  the  market

 potential, goals  and 
facility  which  would  be required, and
succeeded in convincing both Mr. Daugherty and Messrs. Kennedy and Williams
of Kelsey Hayes
that we must have a totally separate
plant. A search for property resulted in finding the Middle Settlement Road
site, and Doc
negotiated the purchase of not only the plot
presently owned by SMC but the property up to Clinton Road and a swath up
to Seneca
Turnpike.  It was time to plan to move again.
<P><BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<P>  Brown and Mathews, an architect-engineering firm in NYC was retained
to design the
building and support facilities on the Middle
Settlement Road Site.  They were to include a melt shop large enough for
the present furnaces as
well as the new furnaces, (there were
to be two from ASEA), as well as support operations, generous lab and pilot
plant facilities and
reasonable office space.  It was to be
located on the property such that it could be expanded as required and include,

in the near future,
a rolling mill.  The work proceeded at
a rapid rate, and construction commenced in the fall of 1957  --  it was
ready for occupancy by
April 1958.
<P>
<P>Meanwhile, the 5000 pound furnace had been designed at ASEA.  It was novel
in
several respects.
 First, it would include the dual frequency power supply.
 Second, it would operate at over 500 volts on the coil using a special

insulation technique
developed at ASEA.
 Third, since it was to be of a two-chamber configuration to permit mold
setup independent of the
melting cycle, and had to
accommodate a wide variety of mold configurations, the writer adapted a design

first used by
Mars in Hungary in a lab furnace,
wherein the melt was poured through a hollow trunion into the mold chamber.


 Fourth, in order to accommodate the 12 16" diffusion-booster pumps, the
writer employed a 48"
diameter manifold with 6 pumps
mounted on each side which tied in to the hollow trunion.
<P>
<P>ASEA was responsible for the final design and construction of the furnaces,

chambers,
add maker, pump manifold and power supply, and
F. J. Stokes supplied the pumping system.  We could find no company who would
be responsible
for the design and construction of the
large rotary seals which were vital to the operation.  Joe Byrne, who we
hired as project engineer
for the furnace, designed these seals
and tested them on an eccentric jig on a large Bullard boring mill.  They
have proven to work
without problems from their initial
installation.
<P>
<P> Doc felt that while the proposed furnace would be ideal when fully debugged,

we
should have a smaller conventional furnace "just in
case."  Besides, the projected business plan indicated that a 2000 pound
furnace could be used
effectively.  So the Swedes were asked
to furnish one in a horizontal tank with no frills except the dual frequency

power supply.  This
furnace was called No. 6, and was installed
in early 1958 in the new plant.
<P>
<P>Meanwhile, the rest of the new building with an area of about 100,000
square feet was
being readied for occupancy, and the move from
New York Mills commenced in April.  The original departmental arrangement
was as
follows:
<P>
<P> The melt shop contained No. 2  through 7 furnaces located sequentially
from south to
north.  The centrifugal
     casters   were eliminated when No. 4 &amp; 5 were relocated, and hinged

covers were used.  
Assurance.
  Sales was located where RDH and PAT's offices are and extended back through
the present
Production Control. 
          Metallurgy was located where the cafeteria is at present.
          The cafeteria was where the library is now.
    The library was in the present conference room adjacent to the lobby.
  A special chelation lab occupied the present Human Resources and Engineering

area.
        No. 1 furnace was located where the computer room is now
        There was even a pistol shooting range  in the present  Q/A area.
<P>
<P>The move proceeded in a well-coordinated fashion, and Doc remarked later
that one
could not pinpoint the moving period from
examination of production records before, during and after the move.
<P>
<P>No. 6 had some  problems with insulation technique on a start up, but
the Swedes
quickly resolved them, and the furnace soon became
a dependable source of  ingot  products until its retirement in the 1970's
when 2000 lb. ingots
were no longer in demand.
<P>
<P>No. 7 furnace was installed during the summer of 1958 and provided its
share of
startup difficulties.  On the first heat a pinhole leak in a water cooled
copper
wedge attached to an induction coil caused water to seep through the rammed

lining to a point
several inches below the melt surface.  The resultant steam
explosion lifted a sheet of molten metal upwards to the cover, causing badly

shaken  operators
and observers on the platform, but fortunately, no physical
harm or major equipment damage resulted.  After the mess was cleaned up,
the second heat was
made (without water cooled wedges), and while pouring
into two 2000 lb. cast iron molds, one of them split longitudinally when
full.  The resultant 8'
diameter pancake welded to the mold table requiring 
considerable time to  clean up and repair.  The third heat proceeded without

problems until the
pour, when an inadvertently placed 16' step
ladder got entangled in the tilt cylinders, which aborted the heat, and raised

Doc's blood
pressure.
<P>
<P>After this rather ignominious start, things proceeded in a more normal

fashion, and No.
7 soon became the company's workhorse.  It has
continued to crank out metal for some thirty-seven years, changing in product

from large ingots
to remelt stock, and being increased in
size along the line.  Its dual frequency melt/stirring arrangement has been

unsurpassed on any
vacuum furnace later to be installed
anywhere in the industry, and considering its original installed cost of

approximately $750,400, it
was one of the best investments ever
made by the company.
<P>
<P>By this time,  billet product was becoming a sizable fraction of the plant's

output.  At
first, statically cast ingots were converted at
Cameron, but problems persisted in ingot homogeneity.  Elaborate programs
were undertaken to
produce static castings with better control
of solidification, but these did not prove very effective.  It was apparent
that VAR melting was
necessary to obtain an acceptable cast
structure, and we reluctantly resorted to toll VAR melting at Latrobe.
<P>
<P>As business continued to increase during the next two years, it became
evident that
new capital investments would soon be needed if we
were to maintain our leadership in the superalloy market.  The bar business
still remained strong,
and it was apparent that we would have
to have our own rolling facility.  An in-house VAR capability was an eventual

necessity, and we
would soon be running out of capacity
again in VIM, particularly for electrode product.  Although we had received

excellent support
from Kelsey Hayes, they were reluctant,
for very sound reasons, in providing the capital required for the major

expansions necessary in an
area in which they had little experience. 
Doc had an excellent rapport with both Messrs. Kennedy, Chairman of the Board,
and Perry Williams, President, and he got the approval
to explore the possibilities of buying the company from Kelsey Hayes.
<P>Without going into the extensive and complex negotiations involved, he

succeeded in
interesting White Weld and Lehman Brothers in
NYC in putting together a package of stock ownership wherein the company
would be publicly
owned.  We spent considerable effort in trying
to come up with an appropriate name for the company using every synonym of

"vacuum," "alloy,"
"quality," "technical" etc.,  but as the day for
closing the deal approached, there  was still no  good candidate.  Hearsay
 has it  that when all
parties were assembled for the final signing, 
one of the signatories said, "we've got to have a name on the documents,
let's call it Special
Metals," and thus came about the SM of the
present SMC.

<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<P>Things moved quickly when we became publicly owned, but first a sidelight

which
occurred a year earlier in late 1960.  In frequent visits
to Europe, Doc had developed a close rapport with M. Jean Duval, President
of Aubert et Duval
in France.  This resulted in the signing
of an agreement for the exchange of certain technical information between
the two companies in
November of 1960 in Paris.  This
agreement led to visits of technical personnel from both companies which
has continued for
thirty-five years.  The help which we received
from visits to Les Ancizes on VAR, rolling, forging and melt practices over
the years greatly
assisted us in fields where we were just
starting, particularly in the selection and operation of new equipment, and
many technical and
personal friendships resulted from the
mutual interchanges of data.
<P>
<P>The first equipment need to be addressed by the new company was a VAR
furnace,
C-1.  After visits to the Les Ancizes plant, a large
Hereaus furnace was ordered from Hanau, Germany and installed in a new addition

on the
northwest of the melt shop.  We could now start
supplying our own in-house melted VAR ingots to the billet forgers across
the country.
<P>
<P>In 1962,  we installed a 12,000 lb. furnace built by Stokes.   This furnace,

 No. 8 was a
bit of a compromise.  We had wanted a unit with
a separate mold chamber to reduce cycle time, but budgetary considerations

dictated a single tank
arrangement which has plagued us ever
since from the standpoint of overall efficiency.  It did, however, increase
our electrode capacity at
a time when it was sorely needed.  Also,
in the same year we added C-2 from Hereaus as a mate to C-1 to increase our
VAR capacity.
<P>
<P>Bar rolling was still being tolled out, and it was apparent that if we
were to remain a
dominant factor in this market, we would have to
have our own facility.  This was a tough call to make.  First, the super
alloy bar business was not
a "tonnage" commodity in the parlance
of the steel industry.  There would not be bread-and-butter rolling to help

defray the capital costs,
and it would be essentially dedicated
to a single product line.  Second, superalloy rolling required a gutsy cogging

stand and a very
tight and rugged finish train to meet the
critical size requirements.  Thirdly, we didn't know a damned thing about

rolling.  With the help of
Aubert et Duval and visits to shops
in Sweden and Wales, we selected a rugged cogging stand and a three stand
finish train without
fancy repeaters, etc.  This mill, ordered
from Morgardshammer in Sweden, was delivered and installed in 1963 in the
north east  corner of
what is now the Bar Mill.  Aubert et
Duval supplied  the roll pass designs used on their Morgardshammer mill,
and these were of great
help in getting us up and running
without an extensive trial and error  learning period.
<P>
<P>The early 1960's were a very busy time at Special Metals, for  business
was not only
growing but diversifying.  It was necessary to learn
new processes such as VAR melting and bar rolling and to develop procedures
and practices to
accommodate the critical requirements
of quality superalloys.  A cooperative team effort developed among the

production, sales,
metallurgical, technical, engineering and staff
personnel which resulted in solving the problems at hand and developing quality

products, which
put the company in the lead as the largest
and best in the vacuum melting industry. 
<P>
<P>Then came the cancellation of the Dynosoar and B-70 projects, which seriously


impacted the sales picture for the immediate future.  While
we had experienced the cyclical nature of the industry in the past and ridden

with the punches, the
bankers behind Special Metals were
shaken when $700,000 had to be written off on Rene 41 and losses hit $300,000
on sales of $10
million for fiscal year June 1963 to May
1964.  It was apparent that the company needed the financial support of a
metals orientated
organization more familiar with the unique
requirements of our industry.  Doc set about locating a potential buyer,
and after early discussions
with Latrobe, succeeded in selling the
company to Allegheny Ludlum  in 1965  --  the company whose scrap Waspaloy
helped put us in
business to start with.
<P><BR>
<BR>
<CENTER> <STRONG><A NAME="chapter6">Chapter 6 --  Early SMC Days with Allegheny


Ludlum</A></STRONG></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<P>Under Allegheny Ludlum, whose management at that time recognized the peculiar


requirements of a specialty alloy producer, Special
Metals Corp. again flourished.  Almost immediately, plans were made to start
the design of  a
30,000 lb. furnace which would more than
double our VIM capacity.
<P>
<P>The writer recalls a staff luncheon with Ed Hanley, AL's Chairman of the

Board, when
Doc asked me how much a new 30,000 lb. furnace
would cost.  After roughly defining the scope, I picked a number of $3.7
million out of the air and
within a matter of weeks was given the
go-ahead to set up the project.  It was unique from the standpoint that I
don't think a detailed
appropriation request was ever generated
and circulated for approval.  It was a case of  -- we need it, design it,
build it and fast.  While we
retained McKnight, Kirmse and French
to design the building, the need was so urgent that it was constructed on
a time-and-material basis
to eliminate the time normally required
for bidding.
<P>
<P>Ajax Magnethermic was selected as the prime contractor for the new furnace,

based on
their developments in induction power supplies
(since the days when they had refused to consider powering the 1000 lb.

furnaces).  The chambers
and pumps were sub-contracted to
Temescal, who sub-contracted the steam ejectors to Elliot.  Several design

criteria were set, including a separate mold chamber capable
of handling the longest conceivable electrode molds as well as a pony ladle
for pouring if desired,
two six-stage steam ejector systems
-one for the melt chamber and one for the mold chamber with inter-connectibility,

a power supply
which would permit both heating and
stirring and an overhead charge chamber with a locking system. 
<P>
<P>The furnace was literally designed "on the fly," with a team of Temescal

designers in
residence in a trailer on Seneca Turnpike to turn
out drawings as we finalized design features.  The mold chamber underwent
many changes before
a satisfactory arrangement was
developed, and the split melt chamber with a center section holding the coil

assembly to facilitate
quick crucible changes was added as
an after thought.
<P>
<P>The melt shop, mold area and charge make-up buildings were erected during
the winter
of 1966-1967 which was more severe than
normal, and by spring, the steam ejectors, boilers and cooling towers were
in place.  The furnace
was erected during the summer and fall,
and the first heats were made before the end of the year.
<P>
<P>No. 9 was not unique in one respect.  It had its share of start-up problems

which
continued through the first half of 1968.  The brick
furnace lining, overheated yokes and various electrical switching problems
come to mind, but they
were systematically solved.  June 1968
was a hot month, and we found the BAC cooling towers would not provide sufficient

cool water
for the steam ejector condensers.  These
were replaced by BAC and by the fall we were getting reasonable productivity
from the new
installation.
<P>
<P>The latter half of the 1960s saw the installation of other new equipment
as well and the
development of new processing techniques in VIM
and VAR melting as well as conversion and finishing.  Without pinpointing
the exact dates, the
following efforts are examples:
<P>
<P> Additional VAR furnaces were required to keep up with the increased VIM

capacity. 
Two Consarc VAR furnaces were procured
from Jay Wooding.  They were installed as C-3 and C-4 in a pit by the Hereaus

furnaces which
was no longer needed for silo-cooling
of electrodes.   They were the first to incorporate Jay's co-axial method
of power supply to reduce
asymmetric magnetic fields and
reduce ingot defects attributed to pool stirring.
<P>
<P>To further increase VAR capacity, a wing was built to the west of the
Hereaus furnaces
and three Hereaus VAR furnaces, which
we had been using for toll melting at Wyman Gordon, were installed. Our observers

had noticed
pool stirring at Wyman which
resulted in ingot defects, and a magnetic survey had confirmed the asymmetry.

During the move,
some major modification in the
support structures and power feeds were incorporated to partially eliminate

asymmetric fields. It
is understood that even today some
problems exist however, which precludes their use for certain grades.
<P>
<P> VAR melt controls were studied in detail.  Soon after our acquisition
by Allegheny, a
joint program was set up between our VAR
shop and the one at Watervliet.  We had developed a program to melt defect-free

A286 which
Watervliet needed, and Breckenridge's
electronics group had developed the "Hash Control" for arc gap.  We soon
acquired the necessary
electronics to evaluate the control
and eventually incorporated it on all VAR furnaces. 
<P>
<P>Arc gap controls underwent many revisions during the next five years as

improved
electronics and  control  philosophies evolved.  This
was before the days of the micro processor, so the control and analysis of

results was  tedious. 
After trying many approaches,
including Jay's "Phantom shorts," we settled on the Robicon control until
the computer age
arrived ten years later.
<P>
<P> Billet conversion was still a toll process.  Doc wanted our  own in-house

forging
facility, and many discussions were had with SACK
and GFM trying to find equipment which we could afford.  Meanwhile, our observers

were busy
at toll forge shops which eventually
included the Dunkirk press shop owned by Allegheny and subsequently sold
to Ajax Forging and
Casting.  This then became the
prime conversion source.
<P>
<P>The Bar Mill underwent considerable expansion during this period.  The


Centro-Maskin grinder was installed as well as much more
support equipment for heating, finishing and inspection.
<P>
<P>Remelt product was supplied, as it is today, from statically cast ingots.

 Chuck Yaker
of Misco and Doc both felt that continuous
casting  in vacuum had a potential as a more efficient production method.
 Our first venture into
this area took place around 1967
with some trial heats in a small set-up in No. 3 furnace.  The results showed

enough promise to
expand the project to larger heats.
<P>
<P>No. 5 furnace was selected for the trials, and a well drilling rig was
moved in to the
melt shop with its boom over the forward part
of the furnace.  A well was drilled over 50 feet deep, and a large casing
was installed.  Within that
casing, a vacuum tight 6" pipe was
placed and attached to the bottom of an enlarged section of the melt chamber.

 This became the
run out container for 50 ' continuously
cast ingots using a specially designed casting station.  The resultant product

had to be pulled up to
the roof of the melt shop and
maneuvered over to the cut-off area, where it was cut and processed.  The
process worked,
although it was not particularly elegant. 
The metallurgical results were less conclusive.  At that time, some heats
tended to "wet" the
crucible during the investment casting
process, and it appeared that the continuously cast product was more prone
to this phenomenon. 
Many heats were made and tested
before the process was finally abandoned.  There is still some question regarding

the wetability,
but it is a moot point now.
<P>
<P>Many projects were proceeding in the Technical Department at this time,

including 
both  alloy and process  development.  I  am  not
familiar with most of these, so cannot accurately describe the details, but

powder making was
tried as well as the melting of Nitinol. 
A process was even explored for making the balls for ball-point pens.  It
was an active period of
diverse experimentation.
<P>
<P>The plant was running out of space to house the increased salaried force
which was
required in all departments, so the first section
of the present Process Lab. was built, and the equipment from the Pilot Plant
in the east wing of
the main plant was moved over.  This
wing was remodeled to provide the offices for the departments which essentially

remain there
today with a few exceptions.  The
library was moved from the front to a portion of the area now occupied by

Metallurgy with
Facilities Engineering occupying the
remainder. The main lobby was where the conference room next to Purchasing
is now, and all
personnel entered through it, with the
exception of the Staff.   This proved unwieldy and was later eliminated.
 In addition, the present
entrance road and guard house were
constructed.  Heretofore the entrance road came off Middle Settlement close
by the grove of
maples on the south east corner of the
property, and there was no guard house.  Just prior to the erection of the
VAR expansion, the
substation, which was about where C-5
to C-7 now stand had to be moved to its present location.  This was done
during a two week
vacation shut down and was a beautifully
coordinated effort on the part of Facilities Engineering.  Of course there
were continual changes
in the front office layout, and the
writer has regretted many times the decision to make the original offices
from cinder block.  The
topsy-like growth in this area  raised
havoc with the  heating/air conditioning systems as well, a fact with which
I  am sure everyone
will agree.

Seventies</A></EM></STRONG></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<P>During the next decade, SMC reached maturity.  It acquired facilities
to make it
independent of toll services, expanded its product lines,
weathered more business cycles and saw a change in leadership with Doc's

retirement.  Several of
the major highlights are described
below:
<P>
<P>Misco and Doc still felt that remelt stock could be made more efficiently
by a continuous
casting process, and a new approach was
tried in the "Chadwicks" project.  This involved feeding a continuous caster
with molten metal
from a consumably melted ingot and
withdrawing it through a dynamic seal and cutting it to length.
<P>
<P> 
The equipment was designed in-house by the Engineering Department and installed

in a vacant
building leased from Central Steel
Erecting in Chadwicks.  It consisted of an upper chamber containing the electrode

with necessary
feed ram, a transition chamber with
a water-cooled copper hearth from which the melted metal would flow through
a funnel type
tundish into the lower chamber.  Here
an oscillating continuous caster with dummy billet, withdrawal rolls and
water cooled cooling
clamps solidified the ingot which exited
through a three-stage, vacuum pumped, dynamic seal to a traveling saw which
cut the ingot and
dispatched it by a conveyor-lift to
floor level.
<P>
<P>The control of the ram drive, melting power, mold oscillation, ingot

withdrawal and
saw action had to be closely coordinated, and
before the days of microprocessors, this was a difficult challenge.  After

various modifications,
including an induction heated tundish
and a barrier diaphragm to isolate the upper sections in vacuum from the

withdrawal chamber
operated in a partial pressure of helium,
successful castings were made. 
<P>
<P>As a production operation however, it was not a dependable process.  The
main
difficulties arose in trying to maintain a constant flow
of metal from the tundish where wandering streams and icicles precluded the

constant metal flow
so necessary for continuous casting. 
Many tundish modifications were tried, but none proved truly successful,
and funds for further
development were eventually
withdrawn.  In retrospect, the process still has potential, and with a controlled

secondary heat
source (perhaps electron beam), to
provide a steady flow and the use of today's computer technology, it might
prove viable. 
<P>
<P>In the early 1970's it suddenly became apparent that the days of unlimited

energy were
a thing of the past.  The "unlimited" supplies
of  $0.53 per mcf natural gas, which had been touted when No. 9 was installed,

suddenly
disappeared.  There were curtailments
during the winter months which forced the shutdown of the furnace, and prices

naturally rose.  At
the same time, the electric energy
rates started to increase annually.  As a result, SMC became an active

participant in the Multiple
Intervenors  --  a group of industries
in upstate NY   --  which contested Niagara Mohawk's rate cases and their
effect on industry. 
This group was very effective in using
qualified rate-case experts at hearings with the New York State PSC to present

industry's side of
the testimony.  As a result, rate
increases were kept in line and substantial savings in electrical energy
costs were realized.
<P>
<P>A second result of the "energy crunch" was the formation of the Joint
Energy Task
Force, of which SMC was a co-founder along with
Revere Copper and Brass.  This group fostered energy conservation programs

within-house and
for other industries throughout the
Mohawk Valley area.  Annual energy conservation projects became a standard
part of SMC's
planning with substantial capital
expenditures allotted for those with potential paybacks of three years or
less.  The Task Force
also successfully challenged a potential
promulgation by the PSC which would have required  a stationary engineer

around-the-clock on
boilers such as those used on No.
9.
<P>
<P>One of the larger conservation projects involved the pumping system on
No. 9.  While
the steam ejectors were very effective in
pumping the chambers, they were atrociously inefficient.  It was determined
that large Roots
blowers would be more economical in
maintaining operating pressures once the chambers had been roughed down with
the hoggers and
first steam ejector stages. Four large
blowers were thus installed in the late 1970s with an attractive payback
at the prevailing natural
gas prices and availability.
<P>
<P>Doc retired in the middle of the decade, and  his retirement party on
March 5, 1976
was attended not only by SMC employees, but
many former associates, customers and industry leaders to pay him tribute
for his visions,
leadership and entrepreneurial abilities
which resulted in a company internationally renowned as the leader in the
vacuum melting
industry.   Nineteen   years  later,   Doc 
and  his  wife  Andray  reside  in Andorra, and his enthusiasm for technology
and life in general
continues unabated.  His current
challenge is the mastering of a Pentium computer.
<P>
<P>Bob Halverstadt took over the presidency of SMC on Doc's retirement, and
under his
very able leadership the company continued
to expand, not only in the existing product lines, but into new materials
and markets as well.  He
moved on to become President
of the Materials Technology Group of Allegheny International in 1981, and
John Pridgeon
became SMC's Executive Vice president
and General Manager. 
<P>
<P> Billet conversion continued at Ajax's press in Dunkirk, but SMC continually

searched
for a more elegant in-house method.  Several
evaluations of forging machines were made on both GFM facilities, one developed

by SACK in
Witten, Germany as well as at
Sandvik Steel in Sweden.  The results on the SACK machines showed considerable

promise, since
the hydraulic action of the four
dies gave remarkable hot-work penetration.  Many proposals were made for
a facility using this
technique, once in partnership with
Wyman Gordon; a second time with Ajax and third on our own, wherein a large
SACK machine
could have been procured and
installed for a ridiculously low price.  Unfortunately, for varying reasons,
none of the proposals
were approved.
<P>
<P> Later in the decade, John Pridgeon, SMC's Vice President of Technology,
became
President of Ajax.  Several of that company's
operations were sold, and emphasis was placed on rehabilitating the Dunkirk
press plant.  The
2000 ton Lake Erie forging press,
which had been a state-of-the art facility when it was built in 1957, had

suffered severely from
lack of maintenance during Ajax's
previous management, as had the furnace equipment.  Under the direction of
SMC, the press was
completely disassembled, reworked
and rebuilt.  New Wepuko pumps replaced the original Dennisons, a new hydraulic

system was
installed and computer control was
incorporated using Pressure Systems Inc. as the contractor.  The furnaces
were rebuilt and
insulated with modern refractories, and
the overhead charger, (a vital part for fast material transfer) was refurbished.

 The press rebuild
took place from late November 1977
to February 1978  after which SMC had a reliable means of conversion, although
it was still
hampered by a single manually operated
manipulator of rather ancient vintage.
<P>
<P>In early 1974, it became apparent that an electroslag remelting furnace
 was needed for
some alloy grades in which SMC and
Allegheny had mutual interests.  After some deliberation, an order was placed

with Jay Wooding,
who had left Consarc and had
formed his own design company.  The project was plagued with problems from
the outset,
primarily because the furnace incorporated
so many potential capabilities, it was an almost "universal design".  Its
features were to
include:
<P>The capability to melt in the direct current mode with bipolarity and
in an alternating
current mode as  well.
  
<P>  The capability of melting both in air as well as in a controlled atmosphere.


     
<P>     The capability of melting both slabs and cylindrical ingots in a

two-station
arrangement.
     
<P>  Since bottom poured slag through a "mouse hole" was not permitted because

this
patent was held by Jay's
          former company, Consarc, a cumbersome top-pouring system was required.

 This also
necessitated the            use of an expensive starter plate.
     
<P>          The copper crucibles were to be electron beam welded.
 
<P>   The cooling water flow through the annulus was to be much greater than

usually
employed.
<P>
<P>Suffice it to say that this was an overly ambitious undertaking for both
SMC, who had
little practical knowledge of ESR melting, and
Jay, who had great ambitions but minimal staff to undertake a venture with
the above
complexities.  As a result, after many delays
in construction and installation, it did produce conventional heats, but
most of the frills were
never used.  Its overall design was just
too complicated for efficient operation.
<P>
<P> The making of superalloy powder continued to be of interest after Joe
Wentzel left to
set up his own company.  An experimental setup
was tried in No. 4 furnace wherein metal was poured on the surface of a cylinder

rotating on a
horizontal axis.  The resultant solidified
splatter produced some fines, but the majority was flakes.
<P>
<P>A second process was explored in which molten metal was poured onto a
rapidly
spinning cup.  This was set up in "The Bluebird",
a large tank in the Process Lab. The resultant powder was finer in mesh but

yields of useable
material were still not impressive. 
Difficulties also arose in trying to maintain a controlled metal flow to
the cup, and its rotational
speed was less than optimal.  
Powder producing became a reality when the Princeton, KY and Ann Arbor, MI

facilities of the
Federal Mogul Corp. were acquired
by SMC in 1975.  This acquisition of a highly respected producer of both

superalloy powder as
well as dental alloys expanded our
product base in two attractive areas.  The previous history of these plants
as well as a summary of
their remarkable progress since
the acquisition are too lengthy to cover here,  It is hoped that they will
be sequentially
documented by some of the old-timers at
Princeton or Ann Arbor before memories become too hazy.
<P>
<P> During the Seventies, the Process Lab, (formerly the Pilot Plant), was

expanded in size
and new equipment was added including:
     
 
<P> D-1 furnace to replace the original No. 1 furnace as a more state-of-the-art

unit for alloy
development.
     
  
<P>D-5 furnace which was a modification of No.5 with improved power supply,

stirring and
pumping.
 
   
 
<P>No. 6 furnace, remodeled to provide centrifugal castings for rocket nozzles

for the space
shuttle.
  
<P>Vader melting facilities, first as a pilot unit and later as a full-scale

machine to consumably
melt axially-opposed    electrodes and cast the metal statically or continuously.


      
    
<P>Powder making facilities moved from Ann Arbor as well as the Bluebird.

<P> In 1978, ASM International designated No.1 furnace an Historical Landmark,

and it
was located by the flagpole in front of the
main offices of SMC.  An accompanying plaque states "In 1952, first commercial,

vacuum melting
induction furnace for
production of superalloys.  VIM processing upgraded the quality of existing

alloys and made
possible production of
stronger, more ductile superalloys containing higher percentages of reactive

elements."

<P>
<P>The preceding chapters give only a few of the highlights of SMC's fascinating

history. 
As I indicated in the Introduction, the events
described primarily cover equipment or process related activities, and I
am sure I have omitted
many which should have been included. 
Unfortunately, little has been said about sales and markets, technical and
alloy development,
production practices, financial details,
personnel and management organization.  These areas are equally fascinating
, but I am not
qualified to document their highlights. 
Perhaps they may be summarized by someone before the records are lost. 
<P>
<P>With a few exceptions, I have refrained from  mentioning specific individuals

after the
Clayville days.  I was often tempted to include many
people in various departments who were so instrumental to SMC's development.
 But I could not
include them all, and did not want to slight
anyone.
<P>
<P>I have ended the history on or about the start of the 1980s, and I feel
I have not done
justice to the era under Bob Halverstadt's leadership. 
The company by this time had reached maturity in its conventional superalloy

product lines, and
Bob led the way to diversification into
sophisticated powder metallurgical products, various joint ventures, capital

expansions and
departmental reorganizations to maintain
SMC's leadership in a field which had become intensely competitive.  The
days of just adding new
equipment to keep up with the demand
were over, and elaborate marketing, financial, production and engineering
studies were required
before a sound capital investment could
be justified.  His engineering and business background, combined with an

unflagging enthusiasm
for cutting-edge technology helped
maintain SMC's position in the industry.
<P>
<P>The succeeding fifteen years have been equally interesting with changes
in ownership
and management as well as some important facility
additions and product line changes.  It is hoped that someone will document
the highlights of this
period to bring the history of Special
Metals up-to-date...

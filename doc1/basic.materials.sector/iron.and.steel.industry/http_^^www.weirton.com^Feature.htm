 Weirton Steel Technical Service</FONT></B></CENTER> 

<p> Dedication to customer needs is a Weirton tradition and a true strength of the company.
<p>
To meet our customers' needs, Weirton's team of Customer Technical Service Representatives travel throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Europe.  Our people work with customers whenever a need arises.  We provide answers to simple process questions, solutions to complex application problems, and ideas for product development.
<p>
The Customer Technical Representatives will also work with prospective customers to determine the best type of steel to order for a given end use.  Years of steel processing and steel application knowledge afford our representatives a unique perspective on customer operations.  This eliminates many problems and allows customers to keep their operations running smoothly.
<p>
As a Weirton customer, you can be assured of a quick response from us.  Our technical service team has a direct link to the decision makers and to the people on the floor so you get fast, appropriate action.
<p>
When customers place a special trial order, our Customer Technical Service members will work with our mill operators, advising them what the customer plans to do with the steel and offering suggestions on how to produce the steel to meet the customer's needs.
<p>
If needed, our representatives will ask for assistance from <A HREF="randd.htm">WEIRTEC</a>, Weirton's technology center.  WEIRTEC personnel may visit the customer or the customer may come to WEIRTEC to work on a problem or develop new products.
<p>
Also available for external or internal technical support is our Analytical Services Group.  This area is equipped with highly sophisticated instrumentation and extremely competent personnel.
<p>
Weirton's Technical Service Representatives act as the customer's representative.  For Weirton customers, our Technical Service Representatives are the next best thing to being in the mill.

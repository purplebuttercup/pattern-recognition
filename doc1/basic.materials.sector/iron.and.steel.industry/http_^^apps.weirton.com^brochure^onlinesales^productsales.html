<BLOCKQUOTE>In an ongoing effort to become more responsive to our customers,
we have developed a system to expedite the procurement process for non-prime
and excess materials. Now you can view a dynamic list of the materials that
we are offering, submit a bid for material that fits your needs and receive
a disposition notification of your bid, all on-line!<BR>
<BR>
To begin your review of our materials, go to the bottom of this screen and
click on the applicable button. For further information about how our system
works, keep reading.<BR>

<B>Registration</B><BR>
<BR>
All registered users have a password that allows submission of on-line
bids, while unregistered users who do not have a password may view our offerings
but may not bid. Existing Weirton Steel customers can request registration
by <A HREF="mailto:larry.holbrook@weirton.com">clicking here</A> to send
an email to our sales department. If you are a new customer who has not
yet registered with us and are interested in doing so, you must first complete
a Credit Application. Once registered, you will be provided with an ID and
a password allowing you to bid on our offerings on-line.<br>

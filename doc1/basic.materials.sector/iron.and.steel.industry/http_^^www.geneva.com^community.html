Back in 1963, Richard Stone, administrative assistant to the general superintendent
of Geneva Works, decided Geneva Steel had more to invest in Utah County
than just jobs. He felt Geneva need to help Utah County take care of its
own.</P>

<P>His answer? Help for a United Way in Utah County.</P>

<P>Stone, who is now retired from Geneva Steel with 26 years of service,
helped organize Utah County's United Way &shy; or &quot;United Fund&quot;
as it was then called.</P>

<P>&quot;It is important that Geneva and its employees help improve our
community by establishing the United Way,&quot; he said.</P>

<P>&quot;It is a good, organized way to give, and it's a way to pay your
share to take care of the less fortunate,&quot; Stone said.</P>

<P>Geneva Steel and its employees continue to be major donors to the United
Way. Since 1966, more than $2.7 million has been donated by Geneva Steel
and its employees with virtually all of this going to help local community
needs.</P>

<P><B>Geneva Helped Establish Utah Valley Economic Development Association</B><BR>
To further help Utah Valley, Stone and a group of business leaders &shy;
under the direction of then-Govenor Calvin Rampton &shy; established and
economic development board. This group late became known as the Utah Valley
Economic Development Association, or UVEDA. UVEDA was instrumental in brining
Stouffers, Valtek, and many other businesses to Utah Valley.</P>

<P><B>Freedom Festival, Springville Museum of Art, Geneva Elementary</B><BR>
Since reopening under new owernship in 1987, Geneva Steel has been committed
to helping improve the quality of life in Utah Valley. As general sponsor
of America's Freedom Festival in Provo, Geneva has helped bring out the
spirit of freedom and democracy in our community. Geneva Steel has also
donated to the Springville Are Museum, the Boy Scouts, and many other organizations,
and has formed a valuable partnership witth Geneva Elementary School.</TD></TR>

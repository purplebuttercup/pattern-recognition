  <h3>Primary Operations:  Steubenville and Mingo Junction, OH</h3>
  <b>The Primary Operations Complex is a highly computer controlled 
  operation--from raw 
  steel production, to continuous casting, and through the 80" Hot Strip 
  Mill.  Coils are sold unprocessed as pickled, tempered rolled, or slit 
  to meet customers' specifications.  Hot rolled is available in thicknesses 
  through .375" and in large size coils that meet most industry requirements.

  <h3>Coke Plant: Follansbee, WV</h3>
  <b>Coke is one of the basic ingredients required to produce steel.
  Coke is produced by heating metallurgical coal in the absence of air.
  The coal is barged up the Ohio River to the plant from Southern West
  Virginia mines.  Once the heat transforms the coal into coke, the coke
  is then combined with heat and oxygen.  This combination creates a
  chemical reaction which is used to help convert iron ore into liquid
  pure iron.  The iron is another ingredient needed to make steel.  The
  facility annually produces 1.4 million tons of coke.  The plant stands
  as one of the world's cleanest, lowest cost cokemaking facilities.</b>

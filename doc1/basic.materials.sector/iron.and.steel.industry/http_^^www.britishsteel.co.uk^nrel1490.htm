<IMG SRC="aapic/brian1.gif"ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=96 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=9>

The year ended 29 March 1997 proved to be a difficult one for the Company
due to weak prices in our major markets and, latterly, the strength of
sterling, particularly against the deutschmark.  Despite these difficulties
the Company made a profit before tax of £451m (1995/96 : £1,102m) and
earnings per share of 15.22p (1995/96 : 38.28p).  The Board is recommending
a final dividend of 7p per share which makes a total dividend for the year
of 10p per share, the same as last year.<P>
All UK businesses were affected by the pricing and currency situation, but
Avesta Sheffield AB, our 51% owned Swedish stainless steel subsidiary, was
particularly badly hit.  Furthermore it also incurred delayed commissioning
and rationalisation costs so that its contribution to British Steels
results before tax for the year amounted to a loss of £7m compared with a
profit in 1995/96 of £228m.<P>
  
Capital expenditure during the year amounted to £413m, the highest level
since 1991.  The largest project completed in the year was the new
steelmaking and continuous casting plant and the upgrading of the hot
steckel mill at Tuscaloosa in Alabama, USA.  The plant began hot
commissioning in October 1996 and has made good progress since, with
production ahead of the project plan.  The development of the direct reduced
iron facility at Mobile, also in Alabama, is proceeding well and is due to
come on stream progressively later this year.  A number of major projects
are also being undertaken in the UK, notably the start of the installation
of a continuous annealing line at Port Talbot at a total cost of £121m, the
completion this summer of the Scunthorpe bloom caster at a cost of £43m and
the rebuild of the Scunthorpe Queen Bess blast furnace at a cost of £30m.<P>
  
Trico Steel Company LLC, our joint venture in the USA with LTV Corporation
and Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd, made good progress.  The plant began hot
commissioning in March of this year and is due to be fully operational by
Spring 1998.  During the year British Steel disposed of its Forgings
Business and at the end of the year its 40% interest in TWIL Limited.<P>
  
We continue to look for suitable opportunities to expand the Groups
manufacturing base in the growing markets of Asia and the Far East.  We are
proceeding with the purchase of land near Bombay in India to build an
organic coating line and roll profiling facilities in conjunction with
Jindal Iron & Steel Co. Ltd.  We have also been in discussions for some time
with PT Bakrie & Brothers with a view to building a coil plate mini-mill in
Indonesia, and are currently carrying out feasibility studies.<P>
  
The steel trading outlook for 1997/98 is one of cautious optimism, although
concerns remain about the current strength of sterling and its serious
impact on our future profits.  Demand remains buoyant in the UK, USA and Far
East and is progressively improving in mainland Europe where prices are also
now improving.  However, the strength of sterling is a problem to British
Steel and to many of its UK customers who are also significant exporters.
Their order books are bound to be affected later this year if sterling
remains at its present level.<P>
  
British Steel trades successfully in most steel markets in the world and is
determined to continue to do so, despite the present currency scene.
Accordingly three major initiatives have been launched to improve costs and
efficiency further.  These relate to reducing the number of employees and
improving the skills of the remaining workforce, a drive for sustained
reduction in the costs of raw materials, supplies and services, and to
enhance and make better use of our information technology systems on a Group
wide basis.  We are confident that these initiatives coupled with our
marketing and commercial skills will ensure our products remain competitive
in our various markets.<P>

<B>REVIEW OF 1996/97</B><P>
  
Turnover at £7,224m, while 2% higher than the previous year, included the
full year effect of the consolidation of Avesta Sheffield AB which became a
51% owned subsidiary on 30 September 1995.<P>
  
For steel industry products, turnover of £6,327m (1995/96 : £6,044m) and
sales volume of 15.2 mt (1995/96 : 14.4 mt) were also affected by the
consolidation effect.  Setting this aside, there was a reduction in turnover
of 6%, an increase in sales volume of 2% and average revenue per tonne was
down by 8%, from £362 in the previous year to £332 in 1996/97.<P>
  
In the UK, sales volume amounted to 7.5 mt, of which 6.6 mt were in British
Steels main finished products.  UK demand for these products at 11.3 mt was
2% below the level of 1995/96, largely as a result of destocking.  British
steel, however, increased its UK market share to 58% as compared with 57%
for the previous year.<P>
  
In other markets British Steels deliveries increased, in the rest of Europe
to 4.8mt (1995/96 : 4.3mt) and, in markets outside Europe to 2.9mt (1995/96
: 2.7mt), the effect of the consolidation of Avesta Sheffield AB for the
full year being a major factor.<P>
  
From a peak reached in mid-1995 world steel prices have declined, reflecting
a deteriorating supply/demand balance as growth in demand slowed and excess
steel stocks were run down.  This was evident first in China, where steel
imports fell sharply, and subsequently in the USA and then in Western Europe
where destocking was particularly vigorous.<P>
  
The effect of falling prices on British Steels results has been exacerbated
by the increasing strength of sterling, particularly against the
deutschmark.  Although in 1996/97 the effect was partially offset by
currency hedging, average revenue per tonne, of £398 in the second half, was
9% below the level of the first half.<P>
  
Operating costs at £6,848m in 1996/97 were 12% above the previous years
level due, almost entirely, to the effect of the consolidation of Avesta
Sheffield AB for the full year.  Excluding this factor, total costs were
largely unchanged, with the effects of increased sales volume, relatively
low cost inflation, the higher level of  provisions, efficiency improvements
and exchange rate effects, broadly cancelling each other.  Included in
1996/97 operating costs were provisions of £61m, in contrast to a net
release of £14m in the previous year.<P>
  
The number of employees worldwide was 50,400 at the end of 1996/97 as
compared with 54,000 at the end of the previous year.  Part of this
reduction, some 2,100 employees, related to the disposal of the Companys
Forgings Business in January 1997.<P>
  
British Steel continued to be strongly cash generative in 1996/97 with the
operating cash inflow of £869m, including the benefit of a £182m improvement
in working capital.  Despite significantly higher cash outflows on tax and
capital expenditure, net funds at the end of the year increased to £785m
(1995/96 : £690m).<P>

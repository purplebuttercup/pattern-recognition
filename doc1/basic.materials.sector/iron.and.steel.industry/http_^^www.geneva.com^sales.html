By increasing the power in Geneva's four-high reversing roughing mill from
7,500 horsepower to 22,000 horsepower, increased throughput with better
temperature control has resulted. The rougher can reduce a slab from 8.7
inches thick to one-inch in five passes. A coil box enables Geneva to roll
large, wide coils with good gauge and shape at proper finishing temperature.
Similarly, the installation of a laminar flow cooling system provides more
uniform mechanical properties in our steel.</P>

<P>Geneva Steel has three plate finishing capabilities, including wide coiled
plate, flat-rolled plate and strip mill plate product.</P>

<P>Geneva can roll the thinner plate products with the same production efficiencies
as thicker plate products, producing superior quality coils and plate (including
high-end products such as pressure vessel quality and HSLA steels).</P>

<P>Steel coils up to 1,000 PIW and up to 124-inches wide and 1-inch thick
can be processed through the Company's 126-inch wide cut-up-line. The line
also has rotary trimmers to produce cut edge product when required. Plate
is stenciled to mark its grade and size, transported to a piling bed and
then moved to the plate shipping facility where it is loaded onto trucks
or railcars for shipping.</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="192"><P><B><FONT SIZE=+2><A HREF="sheet.html">1,000 PIW COIL</A></FONT></B><BR>
Geneva has the only combination six stand wide plate and strip mill operating
in the world. We can switch back and forth between production of hot-rolled
coils and plate with a roll change. With our expanded capacity to produce
both hot-rolled coils and plate, Geneva can better serve customer requirements.</P>

<P>Geneva Steel coils are produced in traditional hot-rolled bands 72 inches
wide and less or coils up to 124 inches wide and one inch thick, providing
improved cost-efficiencies for customers by decreasing yield loss and down
time.</P>

<P>Geneva also offers its customers temper-rolled sheet coils for selected
end-uses where cut edges, freedom from coil breaks or special packaging
is required.</P>

<P>After being banded and categorized, coils are transported to storage
and loading facilities, where they await shipment to Geneva customers via
rail or truck transport.</P>

<P>Typical end-uses for Geneva Steel products include industrial and agricultural
machinery, pipelines, <BR>
ships and barges, rail cars, storage <BR>
tanks, structural tubing and highway guardrails.</TD>

Geneva Steel's high frequency electric resistance weld pipe mill has an
established reputation for producing high quality pipe. This is due to the
use of high quality coil made from steel manufactured through our ladle
metallurgy furnace, cast in our continuous caster, then complemented by
the Company's outstanding production and testing facilities. The pipe mill
uses an ultrasonic testing system that inspects weld quality following the
pipe welding process and again after the hydrotesting process. In addition,
the body and weld of each section is then tested with a full body electromagnetic
inspection system, making it one of the few mills in the industry to offer
both ultrasonic and EMI testing after the hydrotest. Geneva's pipe mill
is a qualified producer of API line pipe and oil country tubular products.
Due to the centralized western location and low cost production process,
the pipe mill can reach many areas of the country very competitively.</TD></TR>

    <P>Through its revolutionary plant modernization, Geneva Steel has increased
    operating efficiencies, expanded product lines, improved product quality
    and significantly increased throughput capacity. With these improvements
    in place, Geneva is working to provide superior customer satisfaction that
    brings the revolution home to our customers.</P>
    <P>The Company recently completed a product sales kit which includes a
    video of our steelmaking process for both plate and coil products. Theses
    kits are available by calling Geneva Sales at 1-800-874-5316 or by e-mail

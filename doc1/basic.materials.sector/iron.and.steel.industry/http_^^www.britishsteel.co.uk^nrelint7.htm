<B>INTERIM STATEMENT</B><P>

The results for the half year reflected the adverse impact of the sustained strengthening of sterling, particularly against the deutschmark.  Nevertheless, British Steel achieved a pre-tax profit of £143m (1996/97 : £262m) and earnings per share of 4.75p (1996/97 : 8.58p).  The Board has declared an unchanged interim dividend of 3p per share.<p>

Deliveries during the first half year totalled 7.5mt, an increase of 4% over the corresponding period last year. Average revenue per tonne was, however, lower by 11% with the effect of the strong pound more than offsetting the benefits of improved selling prices.  Turnover for steel industry products, therefore, fell 7% to £2,937m.<p>

UK demand for British Steel's main finished products, at 5.7mt, was 5% above the corresponding period last year, largely reflecting buoyant conditions in the automotive sector and improved demand for commercial buildings.  In mainland Europe, steel demand improved during the half year and in North America and South East Asia demand continued to be strong.<p>

The results of Avesta Sheffield, our 51% owned stainless steel subsidiary, were disappointing with the benefits of higher sales and modest price improvements being offset by exchange rate effects in its UK and Swedish businesses.<p>

Group results were also adversely affected by the commissioning costs of recent investments in North America.  Tuscaloosa Steel continued its working-up programme and Trico Steel, our 25% owned joint venture, commenced its commissioning and build-up in the first half year.  Commissioning of the Company's direct reduced iron making facility at Mobile began in September.  We expect all three investments to achieve full capacity during 1998.<p>

The Group achieved a net operating cash inflow of £197m.  After taking account of capital expenditure of £201m and the buyback of 93 million shares, at a cost of £146m, net funds amounted to £471m at the half year end.<p>

<B>Sir Brian Moffat, Chairman and Chief Executive, said:</B><p>

<IMG SRC="aapic/brian1.gif"ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT=144 WIDTH=96 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=9>
"This was a tough half year for British Steel due to  the strength of sterling.  Nevertheless, our commercial teams secured record order levels so that all our major  UK plants worked at or close to capacity and we continue to operate profitably.<p>

We have made good progress on the accelerated programme of cost and efficiency improvements.  The radical manpower review is already yielding significant benefits with over 2,000 job reductions being identified since April, of which over 500 left the group in the first half.  In parallel a simplified and much flatter management structure is being introduced which will result in more rapid decision making and progressive operating efficiencies throughout the Company. Our initiative on costs of supplies and services is now well underway.  We have identified significant savings in this financial year and expect these to accelerate in 1998/99 and beyond.  We have also just completed the negotiations for IT outsourcing and extending the innovative use of IT across the Group.<p>

While our order book continues to be buoyant the current strength of sterling and the present volatility of financial markets inevitably give rise to uncertainties about steel demand.  In this connection the recent financial turbulence also indicates the need for caution in the near term when considering proposals for investment in South East Asia, although the strength of sterling may yet facilitate investment opportunities for the Group in international markets."<p>

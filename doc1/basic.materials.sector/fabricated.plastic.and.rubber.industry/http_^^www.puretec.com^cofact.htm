<H3>Corporate Overview</H3>

PureTec Corporation was formed in 1995 by the merger of two established companies, the "old" Pure Tech International and Ozite Corporation, as well as a former division of Occidental Chemical Corporation.  These companies and their operating subsidiaries have been combined to form a vertically integrated manufacturer of specialty plastic products that are leaders in a number of niche markets.  In our first year, PureTec's new management team has developed a number of initiatives designed to bring more of our substantial revenue stream to the bottom line.  We will be making key investments over the next fiscal year to implement these plans, particularly in the areas of productivity improvements and expansion of our growing product lines. 
<BR><BR>
PureTec employs approximately 1,900 people and operates 22 manufacturing facilities worldwide.

<H3>Products</H3>

Although the "new" PureTec Corporation is only one year old, most of our operating subsidiaries have long histories as successful businesses, with high quality products and excellent service to our customers. 
<BR><BR>
People encounter PureTec products almost daily without realizing it.

<UL>
<LI>If you use a garden hose, there is a good chance that we made it, since we have over 45% of the U. S. hose market.
<LI>If you write with a ball point, felt tip, or cartridge pen, the plastic tube or cartridge inside is most likely ours.
<LI>If you use an aerosol or spray pump dispenser, it's very likely that we manufactured the tube and gasket inside.
<LI>We have been a leader in medical tubing for more than 35 years.  In addition, a number of leading producers of medical devices use our FDA-grade plastic compounds.
<LI>You probably walk on our vinyl dispersion resins everyday, since the tile on your kitchen floor and the soles of your shoes may be made of these materials.
<LI>In fact, you may actually use the same plastic more than once, if you buy a variety of non-food consumer products in plastic bottles made in part from our recycled materials.
</UL>
PureTec continues to grow its product lines, and to expand with its customers as they enter new markets overseas.

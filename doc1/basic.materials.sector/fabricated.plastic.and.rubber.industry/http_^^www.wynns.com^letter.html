<P>We are pleased to report that Wynn's International, Inc. had another
very successful year in 1996. In addition to achieving record financial
results for the fifth consecutive year, we also strengthened the future
prospects of Wynn's through an acquisition and a disposition. Our efforts

have drawn a very favorable reaction from the investment community. The
price of a common share at December 31, 1996 increased 60% over the share

price at the end of 1995, which itself was a 35% improvement over the 
price
at the end of 1994. Our share price performance compared to the general
stock market and to our industry peer group has been impressive over the
past several years (see Financial Highlights section for a graph showing
total return to investors).</P>

<P>During the fourth quarter of 1996, the Board of Directors authorized
a three-for-two stock split, which is the third three-for-two split in 
less
than four years. This split is part of a continuing series of actions by
the Board to enhance the attractiveness of Wynn's common stock to 
institutional
and individual investors.</P>

<P>In last year's letter we stated our belief that Wynn's stock was 
undervalued
in the marketplace. Despite the substantial appreciation in the price of
Wynn's common stock in 1996, we feel that the stock is still undervalued
because of the fundamental strengths of Wynn's. Underlying Wynn's success

is a continuing devotion to our primary corporate strategy detailed in 
our
Annual Reports in earlier years. We combine the use of technology to 
develop
new and better products with outstanding service to sell those products.
Our dedicated work force is attuned to the needs of our customers, but 
remains
focused on being the low cost producer. The Company's solid foundation 
provides
the basis for our optimistic outlook.</P>

<P>After a review of the 1996 financial results, we will describe in more

detail our accomplishments and other developments during the past year 
and
discuss our plans for the future.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#0C5683">1996 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS</FONT></H3>

<P>In May 1996, we sold substantially all of the operating assets of 
Wynn's
Climate Systems' air conditioning business. Due to this sale, we have 
recast
our financial statements into continuing and discontinued operations.</P>


<P>The focus of my comments will be on continuing operations which 
provides
better comparability between the current and historical performance of 
our
continuing businesses.</P>

<P>Income from continuing operations in 1996 was $21,301,000, a 28% gain
over 1995's strong performance. Earnings per share from continuing 
operations
were $1.50, an increase of 24% compared to $1.21 in 1995. All per share
amounts have been adjusted to reflect the three-for-two stock split to 
stockholders
of record in December 1996. The earnings growth in our continuing 
operations
was driven by another record year of revenues and profits at our two main

business units, Wynn Oil Company (Wynn Oil) and Wynn's-Precision, Inc. 
(Precision).
We also had a significant increase in interest income (net of interest 
expense)
in 1996 due to the substantial reduction of debt in 1995 and the growth
of short-term investments in 1996.</P>

<P>Net income for the year ended December 31, 1996 was $20,438,000, an 
all-time
record and a 32% increase over 1995's net income. Included in the 1996 
net
income is the $863,000 after-tax loss realized on the sale of Wynn's 
Climate
Systems' operating assets. On a per share basis, net income in 1996 rose
to $1.44 per share, a 29% jump over the $1.12 reported in 1995.</P>

<P>Consolidated revenues from continuing operations in 1996 were 
$288,531,000,
a 10% increase over 1995 revenues of $262,584,000. We're pleased to have
achieved one of our principal goals which was double digit revenue growth

in 1996. The continuing rapid growth of the Wynn Oil Product Warranty 
Division
and the Precision composite gasket product line were the major factors 
behind
the increased sales. Our gross margin in 1996 was 39.5%, only slightly 
below
the 40.1% margin achieved in 1995. The small decline in gross margin was
due mainly to the change in mix of products sold in 1996 compared to 
1995.
The mix change also led to a beneficial decline in operating expenses as
a percentage of revenues, which fell to 28.3% in 1996 from 29.8% in 1995.

The decline in operating expenses reflects the operating leverage of our
business units, as we were able to increase our revenues without a 
proportionate
increase in costs.</P>

<P>Results in the fourth quarter of 1996 were similar to the full year 
results.
Net sales from continuing operations for the quarter were $74,631,000, a
14% increase over the fourth quarter of 1995. Revenues for the fourth 
quarter
benefited from Precision's September 30, 1996 acquisition of an 
automotive
plastic sealing business.</P>

<P>Income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 1996 was 
$5,631,000
or $.40 per share, a 31% increase over the 1995 fourth quarter. Net 
income
for the fourth quarter of 1996, including discontinued operations, was 
$6,057,000
or $.43 per share, a 58% increase over the prior year. In the fourth 
quarter
of 1995, the discontinued air conditioning business recorded a loss of 
$488,000.</P>

<P>Our consolidated financial position strengthened again in 1996 due to
the earnings and cash flow generated by our operating units and the cash
received from the sale of the air conditioning business. Cash balances at

December 31, 1996 were $53,304,000, which represents an increase of over
$30 million during 1996. The year-end cash balances are net of the 
approximately
$8.3 million used for the Precision acquisition in September 1996. We 
ended
1996 again with virtually no interest-bearing debt, unchanged from the 
beginning
of the year.</P>

<P>Stockholders' equity rose to $132,952,000 at December 31, 1996. Return

on average equity, which has been steadily increasing, reached a very 
impressive
16.4% in 1996.</P>

<P>Our long standing dividend payment record now covers 88 consecutive 
quarters.
At the February 5, 1997 Board of Directors meeting, the Board declared a
quarterly dividend of $.08 per share, representing a 20% increase over 
the
previous dividend rate and the fourth increase in the dividend rate in 
the
past four years. The dividend increases and stock splits since 1993 
reflect
the Board of Directors' belief in the strength of the Company and its 
continued
commitment to enhance stockholder value.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#0C5683">THE YEAR IN REVIEW</FONT></H3>

<P>Many of our efforts proved successful in 1996. Among the most notable
was Precision's September 1996 niche acquisition of an automotive sealing

business that manufactures and sells plastic seals to automotive original

equipment manufacturers and Tier 1 suppliers. Through this acquisition,
Precision boosted its production capabilities and marketing prowess for
these products. We expect many positive returns from this acquisition in
the years ahead.</P>

<P>In May 1996, we sold the operating assets of our former automotive air

conditioning business, Wynn's Climate Systems, Inc. This division's 
spotty
results were masking the strengths of the other Wynn's operating units.
The sale enables us to devote more resources to the higher margin 
businesses
of Precision and Wynn Oil which, in turn, should generate more cash for
future growth, both internally and through acquisitions. We expect to 
receive
approximately $29 million of cash (of which we have received $26.1 
million
at December 31) from all sources in connection with the Wynn's Climate 
Systems
disposition.</P>

<P>The Wynn Oil Product Warranty Division and Precision's composite 
gasket
operations were the leaders in internal growth in 1996. Through 
innovative
product development and marketing, these very different businesses 
produced
strong results in 1996 and are expected to continue growing in 1997.</P>

<P>Wynn Oil continues to generate more than half of its revenues outside
of the United States. Wynn Oil's well developed infrastructure in Western

Europe was further enhanced through reorganization of its Italian, 
Belgian
and Netherlands distributor base and its operations in France. Earlier 
management
changes in the U.K. resulted in positive swings in financial results in
1996.</P>

<P>We also made some significant changes at the corporate level in 
December
1996 to ensure strong continuity of management. Wesley E. Bellwood, our
outstanding Chairman of the Board since 1982, was named Chairman 
Emeritus,
capping a 45-year career with the Company. James Carroll was elected 
Chairman
of the Board while continuing as Chief Executive Officer. John W. Huber,
formerly President of Precision, was appointed to the new position of 
President
and Chief Operating Officer of Wynn's International, Inc. Replacing John
Huber as President of Precision is John J. Halenda, the former President
of Wynn's Climate Systems, Inc. Also, James F. Barlow was appointed 
Treasurer
of Wynn's International, Inc.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#0C5683">OUTLOOK</FONT></H3>

<P>We are very comfortable with the outlook for Wynn's International. We
have two successful businesses, Precision and Wynn Oil, that are 
performing
extremely well. Precision is a high technology leader in the OEM sealing
business in the United States, with excellent opportunities to expand 
internationally.
In contrast, Wynn Oil is a leader in the international aftermarket for 
specialty
chemicals but still sees multiple opportunities emerging worldwide.</P>

<P>Your Company has an excellent balance sheet which provides the 
foundation
for planned growth for 1997 and future years. As part of this growth 
plan,
Precision, through technology, dynamic new product development and 
acquisitions,
is positioned to increase its share of the U.S. sealing market. The 
European
marketplace, in which Precision has little present market share, also 
offers
excellent opportunities for expansion as many of Precision's existing 
customers
are very active in Europe.</P>

<P>Wynn Oil, with 14 subsidiaries worldwide and product distribution in
approximately 100 countries, is targeting China, South Korea, Japan and
other key countries in Asia, Europe and the Eastern Bloc for future 
expansion.</P>

<P>Wynn's motivated management team, pursuing core philosophies, is 
dedicated
to achieving double digit revenue and profit growth in 1997 and further
increases in stockholder value. We thank you for your continued 
support.</P>

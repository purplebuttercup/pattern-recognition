            occasional washing, are all that it takes to keep
            your new floor looking new for years to come.</p>
            <p>Breakable household items will not shatter when
            dropped on the floor, grout lines will not crack,
            trap dirt nor stain. Best of all, resilient does not
            have to be sanded and refinished.</p>

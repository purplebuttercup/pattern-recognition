<P>Wynn Oil manufactures and markets specialty chemicals and equipment 
for
a wide range of uses. Customers include (1) automotive repair centers and

fleets for professionally installed chemicals and equipment, (2) 
manufacturing
facilities, mines and farms for industrial lubricants, coolants and 
cleaners,
(3) purchasers of previously-owned vehicles from automotive dealerships
for product warranty kits, and (4) consumers for do-it-yourself and 
household
products. These various products and service programs are sold in over 
100
countries around the world by 14 affiliated companies and an 
international
network of independent distributors and representatives. Wynn Oil's 
mission
is to be the problem-solver of choice in all markets served, by providing

the best service, quality, technology and value.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#0C5782">1996 PERFORMANCE</FONT></H3>

<P>In 1996, Wynn Oil recorded its third consecutive record year of 
financial
results. Revenues reached $148 million, representing 12% growth over 
1995,
despite changes in foreign exchange rates which negatively impacted the
dollar value of revenues in some key countries. Operating profits 
improved
significantly due to higher revenues, strict cost-controls and 
productivity
improvement measures. To increase efficiency, we strengthened our 
production
capabilities and emphasized continuous quality improvement systems.</P>

<P>Revenues from the Americas marketing area increased 24% in 1996 led by

the United States and Canada. The Product Warranty Kit sales programs in
car dealerships continued to grow at a rapid pace in North America, due
to significant expansion of national account business combined with 
improvements
in traditionally generated business. Sales of professional chemical 
service
equipment improved by 15% in 1996, with the introduction of the new 
TranServe(tm)
Automatic Transmission Flush machine service, and continued impressive 
sales
of the Du-All&reg; antifreeze flush, fill and recycle system. 
Equipment-related
service programs also were introduced in Latin American markets.</P>

<P>Revenues in the Europe/Africa/Middle East marketing area in 1996 were
essentially level with the prior year, partly due to the effect of the 
strengthening
dollar and partly due to an off year in our French automotive segments.
Except for the French automotive segments, our European business units 
recorded
improved operational results in local currencies compared to the prior 
year,
although the strong dollar generally dampened the impact of these 
improvements.
By increasing its market share, the French industrial business continued
to achieve growth in revenues and profitability despite a weak economy.
The Belgium operation made a number of important changes in its sales 
management
team and added a number of new distributors in key markets. The rapid 
decline
in the of the South African rand compared to the U.S. dollar overshadowed

good revenue gains in local currency, but profits remained strong due to
excellent management in a difficult business climate.</P>

<P>Revenues in the Asia/Pacific marketing area increased 15%. Hyundai 
purchased
a large number of Du-All machines and recycling chemicals under a private

label program. Our Australian operation continued to be a strong 
contributor
to improved earnings.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#0C5782">PRODUCTS</FONT></H3>

<P>In 1996, Wynn Oil continued to focus on the development of new 
products
and the obtaining of related OEM approvals. New specialty chemicals for
flushing transmissions and treating transmission fluids were developed in

tandem with the TranServe Automatic Transmission Flush machine. OEM 
approval
was obtained from Chrysler for the TranServe machine. Hyundai joined 
General
Motors, Chrysler and many major repair and maintenance automotive chains
and service equipment providers in approving the patented Du-All 
system.</P>

<P>During the year, we placed a special emphasis on the development of a
number of new fuel treatment products for overseas markets. We developed
and introduced in Europe the Remote Control Purger as a more convenient
and reliable means for service technicians to clean gasoline and diesel
fuel systems. In 1996, we accelerated the pace of industrial product 
development
in synthetic and semi-synthetic metalworking lubricants and coolants, 
solvents,
greases, and alkaline cleaners, building on the advanced technology of 
Wynn's
France Industrie.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#0C5782">OUTLOOK FOR 1997</FONT></H3>

<P>We have aggressive internal growth targets for 1997, despite the 
expectation
of continued strengthening of the dollar against key overseas currencies.

Our strategy, which emphasizes cost-efficient, high quality, superior 
technology
programs and products, coupled with outstanding service to the end-user,
is working and will be continued. We have a strong management team in 
place
with the energy and talent to deliver our goal of a fourth consecutive 
record
year for Wynn Oil.</P>

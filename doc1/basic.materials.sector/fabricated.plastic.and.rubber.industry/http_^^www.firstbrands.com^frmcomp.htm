            First Brands completed its first decade on July 11,
            1996. We stand today as a leader in sales, quality
            and customer service in the markets where we compete.
            The Company has been a consistent performer for
            investors, with an 18.3 percent compounded annual
            growth rate during the six and a half years our stock
            has been publicly traded. We welcome those
            shareholders who responded to our solid record of
            growth and profitability by investing in First Brands
            during fiscal 1996. We also welcome the 2,850 new
            employee shareholders who joined us in early fiscal
            1997 when our first ever profit sharing awards were
            made in the form of Company stock. This program was
            approved by the Board of Directors to build a
            stronger interest among First Brands employees in the
            Company's financial performance. <br>
            <br>
            Together, we will continue to achieve even greater
            success by building upon our fundamental strengths in
            manufacturing, marketing, research and development,
            and customer service that have brought us to this
            point. We will continue to introduce new products,
            expand our products globally, and make complementary
            acquisitions. The most important lesson we have
            learned from 10 years of success and growth is that
            the future of First Brands will be what we make of
            it. We plan to make it exciting!</td>

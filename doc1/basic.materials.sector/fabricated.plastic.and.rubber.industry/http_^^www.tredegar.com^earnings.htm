<P><A NAME="3q97"></A><B>STRENGTH IN MANUFACTURING AND TECHNOLOGY SEGMENTS
PUSHES TREDEGAR EARNINGS TO RECORD LEVELS</B></P>

<P>RICHMOND, Va., Oct. 13, 1997 -- Strong operating earnings and investment
gains boosted Tredegar Industries’ (NYSE:TG) third-quarter net income to
$15.1 million ($1.14 per share), up from $10.7 million (82 cents per share)
in 1996. Excluding investment gains and unusual items, net income was $13.0
million (98 cents per share), up from $8.9 million (69 cents per share)
in 1996. </P>

<P>Third-quarter sales were $155.1 million, up from $129.4 million in 1996.</P>

<P>The improvement in third-quarter operating earnings was driven by continued
strength in the company’s aluminum and plastics businesses, where profits
rose 34 percent and 28 percent, respectively, compared with the year-ago
period. Operating results also improved due to higher contract research
revenues at Molecumetics, Tredegar’s drug development subsidiary. </P>

<P>Third-quarter results include a net after-tax gain of $2.1 million (16
cents per share) related to the sale of equity investments in the company’s
technology segment. Through the first nine months of 1997, technology-related
investment gains totaled $6.2 million after taxes (47 cents per share).
On September 30, the cost basis of Tredegar’s technology investments was
$18.2 million, up from $6 million at the end of 1996. The estimated fair
value of these investments on September 30 was $34 million.</P>

<P>Net income for the first nine months of 1997 was $42.4 million ($3.23
per share), up from $35.8 million ($2.74 per share) in 1996. Excluding
investment gains and unusual items, year-to-date earnings were $34.8 million
($2.65 per share) versus $25.9 million ($1.99 per share) in 1996. Year-to-date
sales totaled $433.4 million, up from $397.1 million in 1996.</P>

<P>In addition to technology-related investment gains, year-to-date earnings
for 1997 include an after-tax gain of $1.4 million (11 cents per share)
related to the sale of preferred stock received in connection with last
year’s divestiture of a molded plastics subsidiary.</P>

<P>Last year’s third-quarter earnings include a technology-related investment
gain of $1.4 million after taxes (10 cents per share) and an after-tax
gain of $420,000 (three cents per share) related to unusual items. Results
for the first nine months of 1996 include technology-related investment
gains of $1.4 million after taxes (10 cents per share) and a net after-tax
gain of $8.5 million (65 cents per share) related primarily to divestitures.</P>

<P><A NAME="teijin"></A><B>TREDEGAR’S MOLECUMETICS SUBSIDIARY, TEIJIN TO
COLLABORATE ON ANTI-COAGULANT DRUG RESEARCH</B></P>

<P>RICHMOND, Va., Sep. 10, 1997 -- Molecumetics Ltd. and Teijin Limited
announced today the signing of a research and licensing collaboration aimed
at the development of new therapeutic drugs for treatment of a variety
of blood clotting disorders. The joint effort will focus on developing
Molecumetics’ orally active inhibitors of thrombin, a key protease in the
blood clotting process. Molecumetics’ oral thrombin inhibitors are the
most advanced compounds generated to date by the company’s various drug
lead development programs. The company’s scientists have identified a family
of potent drug lead compounds that have proven to be effective when tested
in primates. The agreement with Teijin is Molecumetics’ second research
partnership in the blood clotting area. </P>

<P>In May of this year, Molecumetics and Asahi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.,
agreed to collaborate on the development of Molecumetics’ orally active
inhibitors of factor VIIa, another protease involved in the blood coagulation
process. Under the terms of the agreement with Teijin, Molecumetics will
be responsible for the optimization of its drug lead compounds. Both companies
will perform preclinical studies, while Teijin will be responsible for
clinical development, regulatory approval and marketing of the compounds
in Japan and other Asian markets. Molecumetics will receive initial fees,
research funding, milestone payments based on clinical progress, and royalties
on sales of products in Japan and Asia. Molecumetics retains all rights
to the compounds in the United States and Europe. </P>

<P>John D. Gottwald, Tredegar’s president and chief executive officer,
said: “The agreement with Teijin is an important step in our efforts to
demonstrate the value of Molecumetics’ technology. It represents our second
collaboration in the anti-coagulant area and reinforces our belief that
our technology is viable from both a scientific and commercial perspective.
We’re actively seeking new opportunities to build a portfolio of drug development
partnerships that will provide additional research funding and potential
royalties.” Teijin Limited, based in Osaka, Japan, is a leading global
manufacturer of synthetic fibers, textiles, films and healthcare products
including pharmaceuticals. Teijin entered the pharmaceutical business in
1974. The company’s 1996 revenues were approximately $6 billion. </P>

<P>Molecumetics is a drug discovery company dedicated to the identification
of orally active preclinical lead compounds for clinical development by
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Compounds currently under
development at Molecumetics are designed to treat heart disease, blood
coagulation disorders, inflammatory diseases such as asthma and arthritis,
and cancer. The company, headquartered in the Seattle area, is owned by
Tredegar Industries of Richmond, Virginia (NYSE:TG). Tredegar Industries
is a manufacturer of plastics and aluminum extrusions and has interests
in drug discovery and other emerging technologies. Tredegar’s 1996 sales
totaled $523.6 million. </P>

<P>RICHMOND, Va., Jul. 14, 1997 -- Driven by record profits in core manufacturing
operations and investment gains, Tredegar Industries’ (NYSE:TG) second-quarter
net income was $16,347,000 or $1.25 cents per share, up from $8,673,000
or 66 cents per share in 1996. Excluding investment gains and nonrecurring
items, this year’s second-quarter net income from operations was $12,044,000
or 92 cents per share. The increased operating income was due to higher
profits in the company’s core aluminum and plastics businesses, where profits
rose 45 percent and 19 percent, respectively, versus last year’s second
quarter. Second-quarter sales were $144,969,000, up from $126,331,000 in
1996. Tredegar’s reported earnings of $1.25 per share include a net after-tax
gain of $2.9 million or 22 cents per share related to the sale of equity
investments in the company’s technology segment. The $1.25 per share figure
also includes a nonrecurring after-tax gain of $1.4 million or 11 cents
per share related to the sale of preferred stock received in connection
with last year’s divestiture of a molded plastics subsidiary. </P>

<P>John D. Gottwald, Tredegar’s president and chief executive officer,
said: “Everything seemed to come together for Tredegar this quarter. Our
plastic films business continued its strong and steady performance, while
profits in aluminum once again exceeded our expectations. On top of this
strength in core operations, the equity investments in our technology segment
continued to generate high rates of return and our Molecumetics subsidiary
signed a drug development partnership with Asahi Chemical, an important
first step in demonstrating the value of its technology.” </P>

<P>For the first six months of 1997, Tredegar’s reported net income was
$27,301,000 or $2.08 per share compared with $25,020,000 or $1.92 per share
in the first half of 1996. Excluding investment gains and nonrecurring
items, year-to-date net income was $21,792,000 or $1.66 per share versus
$16,961,000 or $1.30 per share in 1996. Sales for the first half of 1997
were $278,314,000, up from $267,718,000 in 1996. Year-to-date results for
1997 include after-tax gains totaling $4.1 million or 31 cents per share
related to the sale of equity investments in the company’s technology segment,
and an after-tax gain of $1.4 million or 11 cents per share generated by
the sale of preferred stock related to last year’s divestiture of a molded
plastics subsidiary. Results for the first six months of 1996 include a
net after-tax gain of $8.1 million or 62 cents per share related to divestitures.

or 83 cents per share, up from $8,288,000 or 64 cents per share last year.
Excluding investment gains, net income from ongoing operations was $9,748,000

YEAR-END RESULTS</B></P>

<P>RICHMOND, Va., Jan. 13, 1997 -- Tredegar Industries (NYSE:TG) reported
fourth-quarter net income of $9,280,000 or 70 cents per share, up from
$6,908,000 or 53 cents per share in 1995. The increase was driven by record
profits in the company’s plastic films business and higher profits in aluminum
extrusions. Fourth-quarter sales were $126,408,000 versus $142,734,000
in 1995. Tredegar’s net income in 1996 was $45,035,000 or $3.44 per share,
up from $24,053,000 or $1.80 per share in 1995. Full-year results for 1996
include a nonrecurring net gain of $8,479,000 or 65 cents per share related
primarily to divestitures. Results for 1995 include a net charge of $41,000,
or less than one cent per share, related to nonrecurring items. Total sales
in 1996 were $523,551,000, compared with $589,454,000 in 1995. Excluding
nonrecurring items, 1996 net income was $36,556,000 or $2.79 per share
versus $24,094,000 or $1.80 per share in 1995. These results reflect record
profits in Tredegar’s plastics and aluminum businesses and lower losses
in its technology segment due to investment gains. Excluding nonrecurring
items and investment gains, Tredegar’s 1996 net income was $35,187,000
or $2.69 per share.</P>

<P>The decline in sales for both periods was due to the inclusion of revenues
from the company’s Molded Products and Brudi subsidiaries, which were divested
in 1996. Excluding these revenues, fourth-quarter sales in 1996 were $126,408,000,
up from $115,449,000 in 1995. On a similar basis, annual sales in 1996
were $489,040,000, up from $472,709,000 in 1995.</P>

<P><A NAME="thirdqtr96"></A><B>TREDEGAR REPORTS IMPROVED THIRD-QUARTER
RESULTS</B></P>

<P>RICHMOND, Va., Oct. 11, 1996 -- Tredegar Industries (NYSE:TG) reported
third-quarter net income of $10,735,000 or 82 cents per share, up from
$6,626,000 or 50 cents per share in 1995. Excluding nonrecurring items,
net income was $10,315,000 or 79 cents per share versus $6,175,000 or 47
cents per share last year. Third-quarter sales were $129,425,000, down
from $145,955,000 last year. </P>

<P>Net income for the first nine months of 1996 was $35,755,000 or $2.74
per share, up from $17,145,000 or $1.27 per share in 1995. Excluding nonrecurring
items, year-to-date net income was $27,276,000 or $2.09 per share compared
with $17,186,000 or $1.27 per share last year. Sales in the first nine
months of 1996 totaled $397,143,000, down from $446,720,000 in 1995. </P>

<P>Tredegar’s third-quarter earnings were driven by continued strength
in its core plastics and aluminum extrusions businesses and lower losses
in its technology segment, where the sale of an equity investment in Indigo
Medical Inc. resulted in an after-tax gain of $1.4 million or 10 cents
per share. The decline in sales for both periods was due primarily to the
1996 divestitures of the company’s Molded Products and Brudi subsidiaries.
</P>

<P>John D. Gottwald, Tredegar’s president and chief executive officer,
said: “The fact that the third quarter is normally a seasonal peak for
Tredegar does not fully explain these exceptional results. This time around,
it seems everything went our way. Our plastic films business continued
its strong performance, and results in aluminum exceeded our most aggressive
expectations. The investment gain in our technology segment was icing on
the cake. While the accomplishments of our employees never cease to amaze
me, this quarter will be hard to top.” </P>

<P>Third-quarter results include an after-tax gain of $1.2 million or nine
cents per share related to the sale of a former plastic films manufacturing
site in Fremont, Calif. Results for the quarter also include an after-tax
charge of $795,000 or six cents per share related to the write-off of excess
industrial packaging film capacity. Last year’s third-quarter results include
a net after-tax gain of $451,000 or three cents per share related to nonrecurring
items. </P>

<P>In addition to third-quarter gains and charges, year-to-date results
for 1996 include a net after-tax gain of $8.1 million or 62 cents per share
related to divestitures. Year-to-date results for 1995 include a net after-tax
gain of $41,000, or less than one cent per share, related to nonrecurring
items. </P>

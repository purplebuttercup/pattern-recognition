<b> Mead Reports Third Quarter Results
 </b>
<PRE>
DAYTON, Ohio, Oct. 15 /PRNewswire/ -- The Mead Corporation (NYSE: <A HREF="http://www.dbc.com/cgi-bin/squote.exe?source=prnewswire&ticker=MEA">MEA</A>) today 
reported third quarter net earnings of $50.3 million, or 94 cents per share, 
compared to 1996 third quarter earnings of $62.7 million, or $1.18 per share.
    Sales for the quarter were $1.38 billion, an increase of 12 percent from
$1.23 billion in 1996.  The increase primarily reflects Mead's acquisition in
November 1996 of a coated and specialty paper mill in Rumford, Maine.
    Earnings improved over the prior year within the Paper and Paperboard
segments on strong volume.  Pricing, which has been weak for most of the year
in coated paper and corrugating medium, improved during the quarter.  Earnings
within the Distribution and School and Office Products segment were much lower
on reduced margins.
 
    Paper
    Earnings improved over the prior year on volume growth in coated paper,
primarily because of the Rumford mill and strong sales volumes within the
Specialty Paper Division.  Coated paper pricing, which had been very low
earlier this year, strengthened during the quarter.  Carbonless paper volumes
and prices declined slightly from the prior year.  The Paper segment's mills
operated well during the quarter.
 
    Packaging and Paperboard
    Earnings within the segment improved on volume growth in corrugating
medium and strong volume and operations within the Coated Board System.
Within the Coated Board System, beverage volume continued to grow, especially
in North America and Latin America, and earnings improved despite
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against European currencies.  Converting
operations improved over the prior year.  Open market sales of Coated Natural
Kraft(TM) also increased.
    In the Coated Board Division, startup of the rebuilt Number 1 machine at
the Mahrt Mill in Alabama was excellent following its June shutdown.  The
division also reported strong wood operations during the quarter.
    Volume growth in corrugating medium over the prior year was driven by the
Containerboard Division's new machine at the Stevenson mill in Alabama and
strong operations overall.  Medium pricing improved during the quarter from
very low levels earlier this year.  Sales volume at the division's corrugated
container plants also increased, although pricing is below prior-year levels.
Expansion of the new machine and related environmental improvements continue
to be on track for mid-1998 completion.
 
    Distribution and School and Office Products
    Segment earnings declined primarily on weak results within Zellerbach,
Mead's distribution company.  Zellerbach sales improved slightly during the
quarter from the prior-year period but earnings dropped significantly on
reduced margins.  The division is focusing its efforts on increasing sales
volume and is being impacted by increased costs associated with strengthening
its sales force.  Sales increased in the School and Office Products Division,
while earnings declined from the previous year due to sales mix and pressure
on margins.
 
    Northwood Investees
    Earnings for Mead's jointly owned Northwood companies declined from the
prior year but were about even with those of the second quarter.  Prices and
volume for lumber declined from the prior year.  Pulp prices were up slightly
during the quarter and about even with last year's levels.

    Other
    The company repurchased more than 350,000 common shares during the quarter
and has now repurchased nearly 55 percent of the five million shares
authorized for repurchase in April, 1995.
    "We are pleased with our improved results in the Paper and Paperboard
segments, where we have made major investments," said Steven C. Mason,
chairman and CEO.  "Our disappointing performance at Zellerbach is being
aggressively addressed by the new division management specifically through the
strengthening of the sales force."
    Mason, whose October 31 retirement as chairman was previously announced,
said, "We are encouraged by the strong markets for many of our products as
well as the improvement in pricing in a number of our grades.  I have great
confidence in the ability of Mead people to continue the significant progress
they have made in customer satisfaction, productivity improvement and the
building of Mead as a high performance organization."
    Mason will be succeeded as chairman and CEO by Jerome F. Tatar, currently
president and chief operating officer.
    The Mead Corporation produces coated papers for periodicals, catalogs,
books, and commercial printing; carbonless copy paper; uncoated and specialty
papers; and pulp and wood products.  In the packaging and paperboard sector,
the company produces coated paperboard; beverage and food packaging; and
corrugating medium and cartons.  Mead is a major supplier of value-added
school and office products.  Mead's Zellerbach division delivers products and
services for printing, packaging and industrial supply markets.

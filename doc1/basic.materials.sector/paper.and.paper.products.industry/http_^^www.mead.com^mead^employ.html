Our vision is to be recognized by the results we achieve. To make that vision come to life, we're looking for 
high-performing people... people who are willing to take risks and raise the bar higher to achieve our ambitious goals... 
people with initiative and independence who will thrive in an environment where everyone participates and each 
contribution is valued. 
<p>But realizing our vision will take much more than talented professionals. Mead employees also recognize that success 
can only be achieved with shared values. That means we conduct our business with unwavering ethical behavior -- with 
honesty, integrity and candor.</p>

From building a world-class information infrastructure, to strengthening aggressive environmental protection programs, to meeting high customer expectations and productivity goals, Mead needs people in a variety of functions who can seize opportunities and help strengthen our leadership position. <a href="/mead/careers.html">Click here</a> to view some of the current opportunities at Mead.</dd>

<dt><B>The Mead Difference</B> </dt>
<dd>We need the best talent we can find -- people who are open for a challenge, not simply a paycheck. At Mead, progress is measured, 
learning is constant, and performance and results are rewarded. It's a path that will lead to the realization of our vision and 
it's part of what makes Mead different. </dd>
<p>
<dd>With more than 16,000 employees at locations around the world, Mead recognizes that our success depends on the skills and enthusiasm of our employees. It also depends on establishing an environment where we respect each other's contributions, help each other attain our personal best, provide each other with appropriate, relevant feedback. And, most important, the commitment to give, receive and seek new ideas and learning. It comes down to a fairly simple equation: Mead grows only as Mead employees grow. </dd>

<p>
<dt><B>The Spirit of Volunteerism</B></dt>
<dd>One of Mead's key operating principles is to serve the communities in which we operate by performing successfully as a 
business enterprise and by being a responsible citizen. Mead employees are encouraged to become involved in the 
communities where they live and work. <a href="/mead/public.html">Click here</a> to request a copy of the company's Public Policy Report, which further 
describes some of the things Mead employees are doing to make a difference in their communities. </dd>

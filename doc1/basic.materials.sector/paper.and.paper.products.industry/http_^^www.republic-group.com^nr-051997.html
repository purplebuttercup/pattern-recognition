FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
<p>
	Hutchinson, Kan., May 15-Republic Paperboard Company, a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of Republic Group Incorporated (NYSE:RGC) announced today that the Hutchinson Mill has achieved ISO 9002 Certification.  Phil Simpson, Chairman of the Board, stated, "This is a milestone in the history of our Company."

	ISO refers to the International Organization for Standardization.  This organization, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, is made up of experts from over 90 countries, including the US, who collectively created a series of standards by which the manufacturing sector can certify quality systems.  The purpose of ISO 9000 is to establish uniformity in quality systems throughout the world.  Certification is granted by third party registrars after verifying that a quality system strictly adheres to the requirements of the ISO 9000 standard.  The quality system audit that resulted in certification at the Hutchinson Mill was carried out by LRQA-Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance Limited.  Lloyd's is a British based company with offices in the US and abroad.
<p>
	John Gerrie, Mill Manager, commented "ISO9002 Certification is the beginning of a new era for the Hutchinson Mill and is the culmination of the combined efforts of all our employees.  I am proud of every one of them."
<p>
	Republic Group Incorporated and its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries--Republic Paperboard Company, Halltown Paperboard Company, Republic Recycling Company and Republic Gypsum Company--are manufacturers of 100% recycled paperboard, recovered paper fiber and gypsum wallboard, servicing markets nationwide.  Republic's common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "RGC".

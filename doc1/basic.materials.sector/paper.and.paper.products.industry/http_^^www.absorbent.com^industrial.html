<b><i>Good for Business...</i></b><br> 
Our products possess superior performance characteristics.  They absorb liquids instantly making it much easier to control, contain and clean up spills.  Other competing materials such as clay often require hours of soaking time.  Our products are extremely cost effective, absorbing up to six times the volume of other brands, allowing customers to use less material and labor for clean up and reducing overall material and disposal costs. Our products also offer permanent liquid retention, the absorbed liquid is locked into the fibers, preventing leaching, secondary spills and 
handling problems.  
<p>
<b><i>Good for the Environment...</i></b><br>
Our industrial products are environmentally responsible from origin to disposal.  Manufactured from 100% reclaimed cellulose fibers (wood pulp), our products provide the most cost effective 
disposal options available including incineration, fuel blending, land filling and bioremediation (land farming).  Our products are clean, non-abrasive and free of crystalline silica dust, while competing materials such as clay are dirty, abrasive and contain crystalline silica dust, a know cause of lung disease and a probable carcinogen.  Meeting or exceeding government requirements, our products are also SCS certified (Green Cross) and are approved by the Environmental Protection Agency.

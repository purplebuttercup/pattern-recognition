<H2><A HREF="http://www.bc.com">Boise Cascade</A>, one of America's leading forest products companies, is now at the leading edge of specialty packaging as well with the introduction of <I>Wave Flute</I>, an entirely new form of corrugated packaging.  It's unlike anything you've ever seen before.<P>
<HR>

<IMG ALIGN="Right" SRC="1.gif"> We are the only manufacturer in the United States who can produce a lightweight replacement for the standard "E" or "F" flute corrugated boxes that industries around the world have used to ensure package integrity. This sort of packaging is generally used in place of lower-cost solid fiber packages due to a strength requirement, but now you can have the best of both worlds with a low-cost, lightweight, ridged paper product. <I>Wave Flute</I> is second to none in print quality and can easily be recycled.<P>
<HR>

<IMG ALIGN="Left" SRC="2.gif">Its potential applications are too numerous to foresee, but it is currently being tested for such products as: fast food items, bakery goods, clothing, footwear, computer software, bottled beverages, sporting goods, eyewear, and many other products. <I>Wave Flute</I> truly is "the future of packaging."<P><HR>

<IMG ALIGN="Left" SRC="3.gif">In addition to our manufacturing facility in Chino, California, Boise Cascade's <I>Wave Packaging</I> has a world-class design studio with an experienced and highly skilled design team and state-of-the-art computer equipment for all of your structural and graphic design needs.</H1><P>

<H3>If you are currently looking for a high-strength, low-cost solution to your recyclable packaging needs, please contact <A HREF="mailto:Ken_Barber@bc.com">Ken_Barber@bc.com</A>.

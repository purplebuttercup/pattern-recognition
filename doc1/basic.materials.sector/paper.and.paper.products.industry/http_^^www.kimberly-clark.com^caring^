At Kimberly-Clark, we have a tradition of caring.  This tradition is what
inspires us to develop products you can depend on and trust -- products
that enhance your life and the lives of those around you.

<p>

For instance, you may use Huggies diapers to help you keep your baby dry
and happy.  And, when your little one is ready, Pull-Ups training pants
will help him or her become "a big kid."  If you have an adolescent
daughter, you know that she -- like Mom -- can count on Kotex feminine care
products for comfort and protection.  And, as allergies and colds disrupt
your family routine, you can trust Kleenex facial tissue to help soothe
sore noses.  And that's just the beginning.  Kimberly-Clark products are in
hotels, airports, hospitals, restaurants, cars, office buildings and many
other places.  But no matter where our products are found, they are created
by people who truly care.

<p>

Because we care, we've collected an assortment of resources to help you in
caring for the important people in your life.  And soon, we'll have
additional information here on subjects ranging from baby care to helping
the elderly cope with incontinence.

<h3><i>Design Center</i></h3>

<p>Our reputation for innovation and our state-of-the-art design center is known throughout the Northwest. We have the knowledge to create package design that will protect and sell your products. Our point-of-purchase packaging and displays demand and get the attention of the consumer. By using our innovative computer-aided design systems, we are able to provide you with true graphic integrity that continually exceeds customer and market expectations.

<hr>

<h3><i>Six-Color Press</i></h3>

<p>We are investing in a new Graphics Communications Center that will bring new technology and more choices to our customers. The new six-color press is capable of printing the highest resolution in the postprint market.

<p>We will be able to print images directly on our products that could formerly only be achieved with labels or preprinted stock. As a result, these powerful promotional containers will seize attention, provide information, persuade, and sell product better than any "black ink, brown box." They will also be less costly than a labeled or preprinted container. We will keep you updated on the progress of this new project.

<h3><i>Community Responsibility</i></h3>

<p>We are excited to be involved in the growth and leadership of our community through the following: United Way, American Cancer Society, Morningside Elementary Mentoring Program, Educational Internships with local high schools and Willamette University, Leadership Salem, and Boy Scouts of America.

Kimberly-Clark is a company of famous trademarks.  Around the world, the
brands "Kleenex" and "Scott" need no translation.  Since 1872, we've
been known for quality, service and fair dealing wherever we do
business. <a href="#glance">Take a glance</a> at some of the things that
make us who we are, and read through some of the philosophies that are
most important to us.  You'll see how, as we approach a new century, we
intend to become one of the handful of companies recognized as "best in
the world" in terms of people, products and returns to shareholders.

<a name="glance"><h3>At a Glance</h3></a>

<ul>

  <li>Kimberly-Clark is a company that creates quality products, born
  of continual innovation and technology leadership.  We're focused on
  three core businesses: personal care products, consumer tissue
  products and away-from-home products.</li>

  <p>

  <li>With manufacturing facilities in 35 countries and sales in
  more than 150, we're the leading tissue manufacturer in the world.
  We're also the second largest household and personal care products
  company in the U.S., and No.  1 in virtually all of our U.S. product
  lines.</li>

  <p>

  <li>As a Fortune 100 company, and one of the 500 largest companies
  worldwide, Kimberly-Clark enjoys annual sales of
  more than &#036;13 billion.  Since 1983, we've been distinguished as one of
  Fortune magazine's "Most Admired" corporations.  And we're dedicated
  to sustained profitable growth that will continue.</li>

  <p>

  <li>We're a team of 55,000 people worldwide -- but our shared values and
  business priorities transcend borders. That's why we operate on a first
  name basis and don't stand on rank. Although we take our jobs seriously, we
  try not to take ourselves too seriously.</li>

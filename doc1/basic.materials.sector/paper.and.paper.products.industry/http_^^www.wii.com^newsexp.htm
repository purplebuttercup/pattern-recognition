<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>WILLAMETTE INDUSTRIES TO
BUILD SMALL-LOG SAWMILL IN TAYLOR, LOUISIANA</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">PORTLAND, Ore.&#151;The board of directors of
Willamette Industries, Inc. today approved plans to construct a
small-log sawmill at the site of the company&#146;s former
Taylor, La., plywood plant. Willamette&#146;s Taylor plywood
plant closed its doors in July, due to economic pressures of the
commodity sheathing market.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The new sawmill, which will employ 64 people,
is projected to start production during the third quarter of
1998.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The mill will utilize the existing
infrastructure of the former plywood mill. New equipment will
include a hydraulic knuckleboom loader to feed raw material into
a 26-inch debarker, chop saws to cut the stems into specified
lengths, a fully optimized small-log saw system, and an 84-foot
steam-heated kiln for drying lumber.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Dry lumber produced at the mill will be shipped
to Willamette&#146;s Dodson, La., planing mill, where it will be
surfaced. The majority of the lumber produced at the mill will be
sold to current customers, including the treated-lumber market.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Raw material for the production of narrow
dimension lumber at the new mill will come from existing fiber
supply sources, including Willamette&#146;s Southern region
forest lands.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Some of the fiber that is currently being
generated will be redirected to lumber production,&quot; says
Dave Hill, vice president of Willamette&#146;s Southern Building
Materials Division. &quot;This will enable us to produce a
higher-value product from the raw material. The new mill
won&#146;t significantly increase Willamette&#146;s overall raw
material needs.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Willamette Industries, an integrated forest
products company, produces building materials and paper products.
In Louisiana, the company employs more than 2,000 people at 10
manufacturing plants, as well as several administrative and
forestry offices. Willamette owns and manages 709,000 acres of
timberland in Louisiana.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>WILLAMETTE PAPER MILL PLANS
BOILER UPGRADE</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">KINGSPORT, Tenn.&#151;Willamette
Industries&#146; board of directors has approved a multi-million
dollar project to upgrade the No. 7 power boiler at the
company&#146;s Kingsport paper mill. The boiler produces steam to
generate electricity at the mill and also provides steam for the
production of pulp and paper.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The boiler, built in 1965, is still in
very good condition,&quot; says Mill Manager Shaker
Chandrasekaran. &quot;We looked at many options and decided
upgrading the boiler (rather than buying a new one) was the right
thing to do.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">According to Chandrasekaran, the project will
improve the operating efficiency of the boiler and reduce
manufacturing costs at the mill. The project also will have
environmental benefits.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The manual controls on the No. 7 boiler will be
replaced by a modern Distributed Control System (DCS). The new,
automatic control system will enable one operator to control both
the No. 7 boiler and the mill&#146;s new hog fuel boiler, which
is expected to start up in June 1998. The project also includes
installation of a burner management system within the No. 7
boiler. The burner management system will control fuel
introduction to the boiler, ensuring safe combustion. The DCS
will improve fuel efficiency and reduce the combustion of
by-products.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The project also will increase the capacity of
the No. 7 boiler by an additional 75,000 pounds per hour of
steam. This will allow the mill to permanently shut down four
smaller, less-efficient boilers, and reduce opacity emissions.
Three boilers will be shut down immediately upon completion of
the upgrade, and a fourth boiler will be shut down after start-up
of the mill&#146;s new hog fuel boiler next year.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;By increasing the steaming capacity of
the No. 7 boiler and shutting down several smaller boilers, we
will achieve a reduction in manufacturing costs,&quot;
Chandrasekaran explains.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The upgrade to the No. 7 boiler comes on the
heels of a project to replace the boiler&#146;s generating
section tubes, approved by Willamette&#146;s board of directors
in February.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>NEW PLANT EXTENDS RESOURCE
INTEGRATION</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>FOR WILLAMETTE INDUSTRIES</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">MILLERSBURG, Ore.&#151;Resource integration is
a philosophy that has helped Willamette Industries grow from a
small lumber mill in Dallas, Ore., into an international forest
products company. Today, that philosophy is in action at the
company&#146;s new Custom Products/ Laminated Veneer Lumber plant
in Millersburg, Ore.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Resource integration is Willamette&#146;s
term for the process that moves wood-based products to customers
in several internalized, value-added steps,&quot; explains Tom
Karshneski, general production manager for Willamette Industries.
&quot;The Custom Products/LVL plant is a perfect example of
resource integration.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The plant manufactures value-added specialty
products and laminated veneer lumber (LVL) from materials
produced at other Willamette manufacturing facilities. The Custom
Products side of the plant uses particleboard and medium density
fiberboard (MDF) to manufacture drawersides, furniture components
and a lumber substitute called Will-Trim<sup>TM</sup>.
Particleboard comes from the company&#146;s KorPINE particleboard
plant in Bend, and MDF is shipped from Willamette&#146;s MDF
plant in Eugene.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The other half of the building is devoted to
LVL production. LVL is a lumber substitute made of large sheets
of wood veneer bonded together with resin, then cut to
lumber-equivalent sizes. The raw material for LVL production
comes from Willamette&#146;s veneer plants in Dallas, Sweet Home,
Springfield and Coburg, as well as external suppliers.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Metriguard machines at the company&#146;s
veneer plants are used to identify the strength of veneer panels.
Veneer that meets certain strength requirements is sent to the
Custom Products/LVL plant for manufacture into LVL. Most of the
LVL produced at the plant is sent to Willamette&#146;s StrucJoist
plant in Woodburn where, in another value-added step, it is
manufactured into wooden I-joists.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The Custom Products/LVL plant utilizes
other wood products that the company is producing,&quot; explains
Karshneski. &quot;It gives us additional opportunities to add
value to our resources and provide quality products for our
customers.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">In operation since early November,
Willamette&#146;s Custom Products/LVL plant features all-new,
state-of-the-art equipment. Even the paint-line side of the plant
is different, Karshneski says. &quot;It&#146;s completely
different from the old plant. Knowledge and techniques that we
used at the old plant are of little use here. The employees who
worked at the old plant, as well as about 60 new employees, are
working hard to learn to use the new equipment.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">According to Karshneski, the new plant is
environmentally clean and friendly. For example, the plant no
longer uses solvent-based paints. &quot;We now use ultraviolet
coatings that are environmentally safe,&quot; Karshneski says.
&quot;This has drastically reduced our air emissions compared to
the old plant. The only solvents we use now are for clean-up
purposes.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The new plant greatly increases
Willamette&#146;s production capacity of custom products and LVL,
and Karshneski says there&#146;s plenty of room for growth in the
future: &quot;As long as we can add value to products from other
Willamette plants and provide high-quality products for our
customers, the Custom Products/LVL plant will continue to be an
important part of Willamette&#146;s resource integration
process.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>WILLAMETTE INDUSTRIES TO
BUILD </b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>PAPER CONVERTING PLANT IN
BROWNSVILLE</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Willamette Industries has announced plans to
build a $20 million paper converting plant and distribution
center in Brownsville, Tennessee.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Willamette has entered into an agreement to
purchase a 15 acre site in the Haywood County Industrial Park on
which it will build a 125,000 sq. ft. building to house the
facility. Construction will begin within two months and the plant
will open in March of 1998. When at full capacity, it will employ
30 people.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The plant will make cut sheet paper which is
fine paper cut to size for use in photocopiers, computer printers
and facsimile machines. This is the company&#146;s fourth such
plant to be developed in the last ten years, according to Bart
Nicholson, converting operations manager.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The Brownsville location is an excellent
site for us,&quot; Nicholson said. &quot;It puts us near major
western and southern business centers which are a natural market
for our product. Western Tennessee seems very pro-business and
the cooperation we received in our siting quest from state and
local government was extremely helpful.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Willamette Industries currently employs 670
people at three manufacturing facilities in Kingsport and Memphis
and two sales offices in Tennessee with a payroll of about $32
million. The company owns nearly 200,000 acres of timberland in
central Tennessee. Nationwide, Willamette is an integrated wood
and paper products manufacturer with over 13,000 employees and
1.8 million acres of timberland. The company&#146;s 1996 earnings
were $192 million on sales of $3.4 billion.</font></p>

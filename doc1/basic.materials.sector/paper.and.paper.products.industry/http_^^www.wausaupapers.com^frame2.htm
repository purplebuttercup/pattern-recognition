<P>Wausau Paper Mills, headquartered in the heart of paper country, Wausau, Wisconsin, is a leading manufacturer of uncoated printing, writing and imaging papers in the United States.With mills in Brokaw, Wisconsin and Groveton, New Hampshire, Wausau Papers offers a wide range of virgin and recycled paper, including full lines of uncoated index, vellum bristol, bond, multipurpose bond, imaging, writing, offset and text and cover grades. </P>

<P>Known for its exceptional color quality, nearly 70% of Wausau Papers sales is colored papers. A recent $2.5 million investment in more color technology now assures perfectly matched colors, no matter which mill it is manufactured at. Designers and printers never have to worry about color variation.</P>

<P>Wausau Papers continues to expand its recycled paper offerings. To date, over 50% of all paper produced contains recycled fiber. The goal in the very near future is the ability to produce100% of its product line with recycled fibers, without compromising quality. The processes are well underway, with the Groveton mill geared to run 100% recycled now. A $16 million investment in a new secondary fiber system is underway at the Brokaw mill and when completed will allow this facility to manufacture 100% of its grade structure with recycled fiber content as well. </P>

<P>Wausau Papers commitment to the environment drives the company to seek new ways to conserve energy and eliminate waste. In 1994, a new sludge processing system was constructed at the Brokaw mill which takes refuse and converts it to reuseable fuel. Through this process, the mill is able to cut consumption of coal and other energy, which in turn cuts down the VOCs (volatile organic compounds) released to the atmosphere. In addition, landfill waste is reduced significantly.</P>

<P>Under construction at the Brokaw mill is also a new wastewater treatment plant which will exceed both current and projected environmental water quality standards for years to come.</P>

<P>To Wausau Paper Mills, quality and service is the name of the game. Working closely with its network of paper distributors, Wausau ensures customer service with large finished goods inventories and guaranteed overnight delivery within a 200-mile radius of either mill.</P>

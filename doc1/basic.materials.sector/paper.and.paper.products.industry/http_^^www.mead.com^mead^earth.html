<p>Air, land and water are precious resources. They must be used wisely so they will be available in abundance and suitable 
for all users, today and in the future. As a forest products company -- reliant on these resources for our very livelihood -- 
we recognize our stewardship role. </p>

<dd>It's an understandable question: If trees are so great for the environment, then why cut them? It's easy to conclude that to 
get the ecological benefits, it's better to leave trees untouched. Actually, the opposite is often true. Take a look at what 
careful management of these renewable resources can do for the environment. </dd>

<dd>If you've driven past a paper mill (especially if it was several years ago), chances are you noticed a strange odor.  Well it's still not perfect, but it's time you check 
out what we've been up to lately to reduce emissions and protect the quality of the air and water. </dd>

<dd>Today, more than 45% of all paper Americans use is recovered for recycling and reuse, and the goal is to get to 50% by 
the year 2000. More recycling will help avoid the use of &quot;virgin&quot; trees, right? Well... maybe. Recycling extends the use 
of virgin fiber from trees, but fibers eventually wear down, lose their strength and need to be replaced. (Kind of like those 
old, tattered blue jeans you still wear.) </dd>

<dd>We all know kids are to thank for raising our collective environmental awareness. How many times have they scolded you 
for not putting a pop can in the recycling bin? The next generation is our key to a safe and clean 21st century and several 
environmental education programs are helping to give them the knowledge they need. Click here to learn more. </dd>

<dt><B><a href="/mead/quiz.html">Environmental Quiz</a></B> </dt>
<dd>We know, we know... a pop quiz doesn't exactly conjure up fond memories and might even strike fear in the hearts of 
many. Well don't fear. This is a simple check of what you know about the forest products industry and the environment. 
It's not hard and -- unlike your biology quiz -- it shows you the right answers. Besides, when you correctly fill it out and 
submit it you are automatically entered in a contest to win your very own forest. Well.... sort of. Click here and read on. </dd>

<dt><B>Mead's 1996 Public Policy Report</B> </dt>
<dd>We realize that &quot;public trust&quot; is not something that falls from the sky and conveniently lands on a company like Mead. 
Instead, it is something we must earn over time through responsible actions and straightforward, honest communication. 
That's why we publish a report on our progress -- and our shortcomings -- in several areas of corporate responsibility.

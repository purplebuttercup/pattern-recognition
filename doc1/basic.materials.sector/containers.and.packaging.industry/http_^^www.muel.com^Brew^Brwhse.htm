<FONT size="2" FACE=".arial,HELVETICA">Whether starting a new brewery or expanding your current operations, Paul Mueller Company offers equipment for every stage of wort production.  Beyond the main components described below, Mueller Brewhouse Equipment is designed to meet all the needs of the modern brewer while still offering traditional options such as onion dome heads. </font>

<center><FONT SIZE="+2" face="arial," helvetica><B>Mash Mixer</B></FONT></center><br>




<FONT size="2" FACE="ARIAL," HELVETICA><p>The Mueller Mash Mixer is designed with 2 key goals in mind:  excellent heat transfer from the steam jacket to the mash and minimization of shear damage and oxygen pickup caused by agitation.  These goals are met by using a specially designed bottom-entering mash agitator blade and Mueller's well known Temp-Plate dimple jacket.  Additionally, the Mash Mixer is designed with a grist hydration device, CIP balls and is generously sized to accommodate higher gravity brews.</p></font><br><br>


<center><FONT SIZE="+2" face="arial," helvetica><B>Lauter Tun</B></FONT></center><br>




<FONT size="2" FACE="ARIAL," HELVETICA>  <p>The Lauter Tun is designed to meet the demands of today's brewer.  Like the Mash Mixer, the Lauter Tun is designed to minimize oxidation.  This is accomplished by using a mash inlet that is level with the false-bottom, a vorlauf return below the wort level above the bed to prohibit wort splashing and the use of a wort collection pump that omits the need for a collection grant.  The Lauter Tun is designed to provide a 12" grain bed (assuming a 12 Plato wort) and is equipped with: (I) a milled false bottom, (II) a fully adjustable raking machine that smoothly moves up and down during wort collection, (III) a spent grain plow that efficiently discharges spent grains through a bottom mounted knife valve after wort collection and (IV) an under screen flushing application used during CIP cycles.</p></font><br><br>

<center><FONT SIZE="+2" face="arial," helvetica><B>Brew Kettle</B></FONT></center>

<p><FONT size="2" FACE="ARIAL," HELVETICA>Mueller Brew Kettles are designed either with internal calandria heaters or external jackets depending on the size of the kettle and the required heat transfer surface area.  All Mueller Brew Kettles are designed to evaporate at least 8% per hour of boil.  Kettles with internal calandria are equipped with electropolished heat transfer surface for easy soil release, percolator "hats" and internal spray system to rinse calandria.</p></font><br><br>

<center><FONT SIZE="+2" face="arial," helvetica><B>Whirlpool</B></FONT></center>

<p><FONT size="2" FACE="ARIAL," HELVETICA>  The Mueller Whirlpool is designed with a flat bottom and a height to diameter ratio of 0.7.  All Mueller Whirlpools are equipped with tangential inlets and trub flushing systems to remove trub after the vessel is empty, and the larger Whirlpools include multiple outlets to reduce wort residence time in the Whirlpool.</p></font><br><br>

<center><FONT SIZE="+2" face="arial," helvetica><B>Other Vessels</B></FONT></center>

<p><FONT size="2" FACE="ARIAL," HELVETICA>Paul Mueller Company is well known for custom fabrication of stainless steel process tanks in all shapes and sizes.  Other Brewhouse vessels such as infusion mash tuns, wort receivers, trub tanks, cereal cookers, and decotion kettles can be fabricated to customer specifications or designed by Paul Mueller Company's Brewery Equipment Team.</p></font><br><br>

<center><FONT SIZE="+2" face="arial," helvetica><B>Controls</B></FONT></center>

<p><FONT size="2" FACE="ARIAL," HELVETICA>Mueller Brewhouses are available in either our standard automated configuration or custom manual configurations.  The automated system utilizes RS-View, the latest in process control software by Rockwell Software, and logic controllers by Allen-Bradley.  Mueller Brewing Systems' automated package controls all process steps included in wort production.  Mueller Brewing Systems' automation is designed to allow the brewer to easily interface with the operating software to change control parameters.</p></font>

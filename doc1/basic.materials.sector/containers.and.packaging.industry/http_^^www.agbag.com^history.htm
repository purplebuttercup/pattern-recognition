</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Founded in 1978, Ag-Bag International Ltd. pioneered an
alternative method of storing feed for livestock. Traditional methods of storing
feed includes placing it in bunkers, pits, and silos, or baling and stacking it.
Ag-bag's method is to store the feed in plastic bags of up to 250 feet in length
and up to 12 feet in diameter. The feed is stuffed tightly into the bag by using
the machines the company manufactures specifically for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ag-Bag expanded its operations into Europe in 1989 where
it offers a custom bagging service on a fee per metric tonne basis in the United
Kingdom. In 1994, Ag-Bag shipped its first orders to dealers in Japan, Latin
America, and Germany. Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, Spain, France, Italy,
Central Europe, and Puerto Rico.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ag-Bag developed other uses for its technology. In 1993,
it established a grain bagging division and a composting division. The company
assembles and sells grain bagging machines which enable farmers to store whole
grains as well as other products in the recyclable plastic bags and has adapted
its bagging machines to permit bagging of compostable organic matter. The
company has developed plastic bag balers which enable baling and pickup of the
recyclable Tri-Dura plastic bags from its customers.

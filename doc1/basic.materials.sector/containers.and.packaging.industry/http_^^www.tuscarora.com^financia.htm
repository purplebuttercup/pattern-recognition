<h4><a name="letter"><font face="Garamond">To Our Shareholders:</font></a></h4>

<p><font face="Garamond">Results for the third fiscal quarter of
FY97 were mixed. We were pleased to have achieved record net
sales for a third quarter of $52.6 million, an increase of 17%
over net sales of $45.1 for the same quarter last year. However,
we were disappointed to report net income of $1.9 million,
compared with net income of $2.4 million for the third quarter of
the last fiscal year. This resulted in earnings of $.20 per
share, a 20% decrease from earnings of $.25 per share in the same
quarter last year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">For the nine months ended May 31, 1997,
net sales totaled a record $155.0 million, an increase of 14%
over net sales of $135.6 million for the year earlier period. Net
income was $7.7 million, compared to net income of $7.5 million,
while earnings per share were $.81, compared to $.80 for the
first nine months of FY96.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">The decline in net income for the
quarter was largely due to the combined impact of significantly
substandard gross profit margins at two facilities acquired in
the first quarter of the current fiscal year and at two of the
company's existing U.S. manufacturing facilities, and decreased
shipping levels to two large customers who were adjusting their
inventory levels and reducing packaging requirements.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Recent shipping rates have shown some
improvement over the early weeks of the third quarter, and the
operating problems at the two existing manufacturing facilities
have been fully identified and substantially corrected. However,
we continue to experience lower than expected gross profit
margins at certain of our manufacturing facilities, principally
in the businesses recently acquired and at plants newly opened in
the current fiscal year. Also, sales to one of our large
customers continue to be substantially below prior years' levels.
These difficulties, combined with the additional selling,
administrative and interest expenses resulting from the
acquisition on May 30, 1997 of an integrated materials business
in Hayward, California, are likely to negatively impact net
income for the fourth quarter of FY97.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Clearly, the rapid expansion of our
business in the past year has not been without a cost to current
profits. The businesses we acquire are often not strong
performers. While this allows us to purchase these operations at
attractive prices, it does take time and management skill to
bring their profitability up to our objectives. Similarly,
opening new manufacturing facilities always has a cost in terms
of training, to achieve desired efficiency levels. Also, margins
may be diminished as production is moved from profitable plants
and added to the base of business in the new facility.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">In most years, when we have not been as
aggressive and focused on sales growth, the impact of
acquisitions and the opening of new facilities has usually been
absorbed with minimal effect on the company's earnings. While we
may have been overly ambitious in growing the business this year,
you can be assured that we are focusing the best of our
management abilities on bringing the profit margins at all of our
new businesses and manufacturing facilities up to the high
standards that we expect, and generally achieve, from our mature
operations. In the long run, I believe that the actions for
growth that we have taken, and will continue to take this year,
will pay off handsomely.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">On a related note, in May we announced
the acquisitions of a thermoforming business in Southern
California and an integrated materials business in the city of
Hayward, on San Francisco Bay. We also announced the planned
opening next year of a foam molding plant in Tijuana, Mexico.
Collectively, this expansion will give us a significant presence
on the West Coast, the one major market in the U.S. in which we
had not been actively participating.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">While earnings for this quarter are
certainly disappointing and the earnings for the fourth quarter
are likely to be adversely affected as well, we believe that we
have a sound, long-term strategy in place to grow a larger and
more profitable business. That has been the company's track
record over many years and we are confident we can continue on
that path. Your support through these less than ideal periods is
most appreciated.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Very truly yours,<br>
<br>
John P. O'Leary, Jr.<br>
President and Chief Executive Officer</font></p>

Phil Enfinger Rejoins Bemis Packaging Machinery Co.

<blockquote>
<img align=left src="/images/1/iss1phil.gif">
We are happy to announce that Phil Enfinger is back with Bemis Packaging 
Machinery Co. as our new Eastern Regional Manager.
<p>
He will be covering a big part of the country -- from Oklahoma to New 
England -- but the territory couldn't be in better hands. In the east and 
southeast Phil will be working with Peter Bell, Mark Dunn, Brent Ford and 
the Rypac group. It would be hard to find someone who knows more about 
Bemis Packaging Machinery than Phil.
<p>
As many of you know, Phil was with us for 12 years, before he took a 
couple of years off to cover Florida for a Manufacturer's Representative 
Agency. He knows our product line extremely well, and will be a big asset 
to our customers and sales representatives.
<p>
With all of Phil's other interests, it's hard to see how he gets enough 
time to cover so much territory. Phil and his wife Carlene love boating, 
stock car racing, and touring the country on their motorcycles. Of course 
that is when they aren't spending time with their children and two 
grandchildren.
<p>
Phil and Carlene live in Martinez, GA, just outside of Augusta. Make sure 
you give Phil a call to welcome him back to Bemis.
<p>

<P>Foamex International, with a network of 46 facilities in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, is North America's largest manufacturer and marketer of flexible polyurethane and advanced polymer products.  Foamex's quality foams are utilized primarily in five end-markets: carpet cushion; cushioning, including bedding products;  furniture; automotive, including trim and accessories; and technical applications, including those for filtration, gasketing and sealing.</P>
 
<P>In July 1997, Foamex took several steps designed to improve operating performance and accelerate growth in our core polyurethane foam business.  These steps included dividing Cushioning Products into two new product groups:  Cushioning Products and Furniture Products.  This brings to five the number of strategic business units at Foamex.</P>

<B><P>Foamex's History</P>
</B> 
<P>Foamex's roots date back to 1983 with the acquisition of Scott Paper's foam division by `21' International Holdings, today, Trace International Holdings (TIHI), led by Marshall S. Cogan.  Since then Foamex has grown both internally and through a string of strategic acquisitions:</P>
 

<UL>

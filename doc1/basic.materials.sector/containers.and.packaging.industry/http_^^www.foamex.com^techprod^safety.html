Foamex polyurethane Safety Foam has a 30 year record, built on combat experience, of suppressing explosions in military aircraft <img src = "planesm.jpeg"> and land vehicles.  <a href = "bullet.mov">  This 9 MB Quicktime digital video</a> shows experiments documenting its explosion suppression capabilities. 

<p>Safety Foam is used in the presidential limousine and in racing cars, including NASCAR, <img src = "carsm.jpeg"> to prevent fuel tank explosions.  It is used in stunt aircraft and to help protect against possible explosion from lightning strikes on weather reconnaissance planes.
<p>According to <i>Aviation Week &#38 Space Technology</i>, February 17, 1997:
<quote>"The National Transportation Safety Board has concluded the [TWA Flight 800] 747's  centerline fuel tank exploded, destroying the aircraft and killing the 230 persons on board."</quote>  The potential for use of Safety Foam in commercial aircraft to provide safety for airline passengers and crew is being considered as the TWA Flight 800 investigation enters its eighth month.

<p>Safety Foam 
<ul>
<li>prevents explosion in fuel vapor environments;
<li>acts as a surge mitigator;
<li>mitigates hydraulic ram and overpressure;
<li>suppresses electrostatic charges.
</ul>

<p>Safety Foam adds little weight, reduces usable fuel by less than 4%, and is easy to install.  As a passive, maintenance-free system, it is always activated to increase the survivability of the aircraft or vehicle (during missions or while parked),  allowing the pilot or operator to concentrate on his primary assignment.

<p>The material is a fully reticulated flexible polyurethane foam composed of a skeletal matrix of tiny lightweight interconnecting strands which act as a three dimensional fire screen.  It is a passive, self healing, explosion suppression system capable of withstanding multiple hits.  The system is always on guard -- no gauges to check, no leaks, no mechanical malfunctions.  Foamex polyurethane Safety Foam is a combat proven system, refined from experience, that will help to prevent fuel explosions caused by:
<ul>
<li>Gunfire
<li>Electrical Ignition
<li>Lightning Strike
<li>Static Discharge
</ul>

<p>Safety Foam has also been used for discrete armored vehicles, military wheeled and tracked vehicles, as well as in service station island sumps and fuel storage tanks. It has provided gasoline flashback protection in gasoline can "Jerry Can" filler spouts. It is used in agricultural dusting air craft to reduce fuel surge.  In boats, <img src = "boatsm.jpeg"> Safety Foam is used for baffling in fuel tanks to reduce fuel surge and slosh, thereby significantly improving performance, as well as providing explosion protection.  
<p>Stringent in-flight evaluations in Arctic conditions by the Air Force using Conductive Safety Foam have shown not a single instance of aircraft static ignition since the inception of critical testing in 1986.

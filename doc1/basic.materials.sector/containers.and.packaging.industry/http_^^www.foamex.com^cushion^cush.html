PRESS RELEASE, October 21, 1997, --  <a href = "../cushion/furnmkt.html">Foamex International Highlights Recent Initiatives Focused On Serving Furniture Industry </a>
<p>Foamex continues to <a href = "reflex.html">expand its presence</a> in the <a href = "market.html">cushioning category</a> -- one of the largest in the urethane industry -- by maintaining a rigorous <a href = "produce.html">focus on quality</a> and <a href = "smt2.html">innovation.</a>  From its network of production facilities in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, Foamex supplies national and regional furniture, bedding and packaging manufacturers with cushioning foams that customers know will meet their own customers' high standards.
<p>
Developing value-added products continues to be a company wide priority and represents a key Foamex cushioning advantage.  This year Foamex introduces <a href = "reflex.html">REFLEX (tm) Polymer Cushioning,</a> which delivers longer lasting height and comfort than other products.  Last year, Foamex scientific, engineering and product development teams created new and promising applications for cushioning foams based on two of Foamex's most recent and ground-breaking technologies:  <a href = "../auto/vpf.html">VPF(tm) technology</a>, developed by a Foamex joint venture, and <a href = "../auto/smt.html">SMT(tm) technology</a>.  VPF products represent an innovative replacement for fiberfill, a principal cushioning material, because they do not mat or lose shape as quickly.  SMT allows Foamex to design products featuring unlimited "zoned comfort" possibilities in a variety of shapes and sizes.

Other value-added cushioning products introduced by Foamex include:  viscoelastic or "memory" foams for the bedding, furniture and home comfort industries -- which offer unique conformance characteristics versus other foams and materials -- and Latex Plus(tm), a urethane-based replacement for latex, a material also used in bedding products.

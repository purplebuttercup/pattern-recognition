<b> General Felt Industries (GFI)</b>, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Foamex International, is the largest manufacturer of carpet cushion in  the world.  If you have wall-to-wall carpet in your home, almost 100% of the time it will be supported by carpet cushion.  Chances are this cushion will have been manufactured by GFI.  GFI manufactures all current types of carpet cushion:  Rubber, Natural Felt, Synthetic Felt, Recycled Textile Fiber Cushion, Prime Polyurethane (a self rising polyurethane slab foam) and Rebonded Polyurethane Cushion (manufactured from trim cut during other manufacturing processes then glued together and cut into continuous sheets).

<h3>Why is carpet cushion used?</h3>
<p>
Carpet cushion is almost always used for residential applications.  The principal benefits of separate carpet cushion are that it keeps the carpet looking new longer, and it adds a plush or luxury feel to the carpet installation.  Other benefits include:  sound absorption that will make the room quieter; additional thermal installation that will keep your room warmer in winter and cooler in summer; easier vacuum cleaning by allowing additional permeability; and additional cushioning in case of slips and falls by your toddler.  Click on the icons below for additional information on the benefits of using the right type of carpet cushion.

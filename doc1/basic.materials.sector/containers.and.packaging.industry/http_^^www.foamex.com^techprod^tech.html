Foamex's history of providing sophisticated technical foam solutions is why Foamex has more patents than any other foam manufacturer.
<p>
The Foamex portfolio of technical collaboration ranges from high-tech to high-touch industries.  
<p>Foamex polyurethane <a href = "safety.html">Safety Foam</a> has a 30 year record, built on combat experience, of suppressing explosions in military aircraft and land vehicles.  

<p>For more than eight years, Foamex has  developed and fine-tuned the specialized foam in<a href = "res.html" > foam reservoirs</a> for ink cartridges used in high-speed inkjet printers. Many high-end laptop computers have relied upon <a href = "ss.html">nickel-metal hydride batteries</a> manufactured using Foamex foam to reduce battery weight and lengthen cell life. 
<p>
Foamex  created a <a href = "tpcush.html">soft, stretchable foam material</a> for use in baby diaper elastic waistbands.  For <a href = "res.html" >cosmetic applicators</a>, Foamex formulated an ultrasoft product.  Foamex supplies foam for <a href = "filt.html">filtration products</a> of the leading blood oxygenator manufacturers.  Experimental military garment liners incorporate a <a href = "filt.html">soft Foamex Foam with an activated carbon coating</a> that absorbs odors and gases.  Even the nickel-plated battery powering the victor of the 1994 American Tour de Sol, the national solar and electric vehicle championship, used Foamex foam.

Our municipal lease purchase plans give governmental 
entities a fast, flexible, affordable way to acquire 
the equipment they need, when they need it.<p>

It's a way that eliminates the need for large, 
up-front, lump-sum cash outlays.<p>

It's fast because it doesn't involve the complexity 
of a bond issue or (in most cases) the time 
necessary for general voter approval.<p>

It's flexible because payments can be tailored to 
fit the unique revenue requirements of public 
agencies. And it's economical because it offers 
tax-exempt interest rates while still building 
equity toward ownership.<p>

Simply put, it's a plan that can work like an 
installment purchase, with payments applied toward 
potential ownership.

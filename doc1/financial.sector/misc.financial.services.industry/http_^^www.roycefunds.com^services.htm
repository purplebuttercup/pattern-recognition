<font size="+1">INVESTMENT FLEXIBILITY</font><p>

<b>No-Load Funds</b> put all of your money to work on investments, not
into
sales commissions.<p>

<b>Low Minimums</b> give you the flexibility to diversify.  You can
start your
investment with $2,000 ($5,000 for Royce GiftShares Fund) and subsequent
investments of $50 or more.  You can open an IRA or 403(b)(7) account
for as low as $500, and accounts opened with an Automatic Investment
Plan can start with $500.<p>

<b>Automatic Reinvestment</b> of  dividends and capital gains
distributions
keeps your money working hard for you.  Or, you may choose to receive
your distributions in cash.<p>

<font size="+1">INVESTMENT PLANNING</font><p>

<b>Telephone Purchase</b> allows you to lock in your  purchase price as
of that
day's close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange.<p>

<b>Express Service</b> permits you to purchase or redeem shares
periodically
or at your discretion by telephone or computer online access and to have
funds automatically transferred to or from your bank account.<p>

<b>Direct Deposit</b> lets you &quot;pay yourself first&quot; by having your
investments
made directly from your net payroll or government check into your <b><i>Royce</i></b> Fund account each pay period.<p>

<font size="+1">COMMUNICATIONS</font><p>

<b>Investor Services</b> representatives are  available from 9 a.m. to 5
p.m.
Eastern time, Monday through Friday to answer questions regarding <b><i>The
Royce Funds</i></b> and to assist you in completing your applications.<p>

<b>Investor Services</b> representatives are available during regular
business hours to assist you with transactions and questions about your
account.<p>

<b>Royce InfoLine</b> is available around the clock, 7 days a week, for
you to
check a fund's closing price, your account balance, time and price of
your last transaction or distribution and the total returns of your
Fund, and to request statements and tax information.<p>

<b>Online Access</b> is available through the Internet for e-mailing,
learning
more about the Funds, viewing and downloading prospectuses and
applications and soon you will be able to access your account
information and transact purchases, exchanges and redemptions.<p>

<b>Account Statements</b>, prepared on a cumulative year-to-date basis,
are mailed after every transaction and on a semi-annual basis.<p>

<b>Fund Reports</b> are mailed semi-annually.  Each contains details
about your Fund's investments and its most recent performance.<p>

<b>These services are described in detail in the Funds' <a href="prosp.htm">Prospectus</a>.</b><p>

In June of 1993, SRS Labs was formed by purchasing technology from the Audio
Division of the Hughes Aircraft Company. Our flagship 3D Sound technology, the
Sound Retrieval System&reg; (SRS&reg;) had been licensed to RCA and Sony for use in 
high-end televisions. Upon our purchase of the technology, SRS Labs' mission became
clear:  "Revolutionize and advance the reproduction of sound by creating and
bringing to the market unique, affordable, and dramatic improvements in the
quality, enjoyment and perceived realism of the listening experience."  In less
than four years, SRS Labs' audio enhancement technologies have been included in
over 15 million products worldwide by over 115 leading manufacturers.

Our current portfolio of technologies available for license include:

SRS (Sound Retrieval System) is the leading 3D Sound technology in the world. It retrieves the spatial
information from any stereo recording and restores the original
three-dimensional sound field. As a result, the reproduced sound is much closer
to that of a live performance.  SRS
Labs and products incorporating SRS technology have received numerous industry
awards, including the "Best of CES" Distinction at the Consumer Electronic Show
and the AEA (American Electronics Association) "Innovations in Technology"
Award.

<a href="trusurround.html"><img vspace=3 border=0 width=101 height=18 src="../images/tslogo.gif" alt="TruSurround"></a><br>
TruSurround is a Dolby&reg;-certified technology that allows for a virtualized 
surround sound experience from a two-speaker playback using any multichannel 
audio source, including Dolby Digital, Dolby Surround or Dolby Pro Logic.  
TruSurround retains all of the
original audio information of the multi-channel audio source giving the listener
the sensory perception that they are surrounded by additional "phantom"
speakers. This completely immersive sound experience is achieved through only
two standard stereo speakers. 
<P>

<a href="focus.html"><img vspace=3 border=0 width=117 height=18 src="../images/focuslogo.gif" alt="SRS"></a><br>
Originally designed for use in automobiles where producing a vivid stereo sound
image is often a challenge due to door-mounted speakers, FOCUS electronically
repositions a sound image from any non-optimally located speaker. When combined
with SRS 3D Sound, FOCUS creates a completely immersive sound image in a car
with as few as two stereo speakers. FOCUS can also be used in a home theater or
computer sound environment where speakers are placed in less than optimal
locations.
<P>

<a href="avt.html"><img vspace=3 border=0 width=71 height=18 src="../images/avtlogo.gif" alt="AVT"></a><br>
AVT (Acoustic Vector System) is a passive speaker design which can be used with any traditional amplifier
to produce an expanded stereo image. Unlike the company's other audio
enhancement technologies, which are implemented in discrete circuitry or in a
semiconductor, AVT is an audio delivery system incorporated in a speaker design,
which does not modify or process the audio signal components.
<P>
SRS Labs' current patent portfolio now includes over 49 issued U.S. and foreign 
patents relating to the SRS, Sound Retrieval System technology.  SRS Labs' total 
patent portfolio includes over 75 issued U.S. and foreign patents.  In addition, 
SRS Labs has numerous patent applications still pending in countries worldwide.

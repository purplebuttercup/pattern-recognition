(Washington, DC) &#173; Allied Capital continues to help finance U.S. small businesses expanding into emerging nations.  Allied Capital&#146s most recent international investment was to Pico Products, Inc.

The company is headquartered in California, and maintains operations in Taiwan, Hong Kong, St. Kitts, Thailand, and Brazil.<P>
	The $6 million private placement was led by Allied Capital, who invested $5 million of subordinated debt with warrants to purchase common stock.  The Sinkler Corporation of Philadelphia, PA invested $1 million in redeemable preferred stock.<P>
	Cabell Williams, President, said &#147The new capital will be used to finance the company&#146s growth in the Caribbean, Brazil and Asia, to develop new products, and to acquire new telecommunications technologies.  We are very excited about the company&#146s plans to expand into OPIC&#173;designated nations, which fulfills our mission of creating opportunities both at home and overseas.&#148<P>

<B>Allied Capital Continues to Go International</B><P>

(Washington, DC) &#173; Allied Capital continues to provide financing to businesses in need of international mezzanine capital.  After securing a $20 million debt facility from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), Allied Capital has provided two businesses with financing this year.  The most recent is a $3.7 million investment in Csabai Canning Factory Ltd. located in B&eacute;k&eacute;scsaba, Hungary.  Csabai Canning Factory is one of the largest food processing operations in Hungary.  The company began in 1962, and today cans vegetables, juice concentrate, tetrapack, and produces pasta.  The Company&#146s primary customer base is in the countries that make up the former Soviet Union.<P>
	Cabell Williams, President and Chief Investment Officer of the international operations at Allied Capital, says &#147Due to its competitive advantages, Csabai Canning Factory Ltd. is well&#173;positioned to remain an important food supplier to Russia in the long run.  The long term financial projections show a steady growth in earnings over the next five years.&#148<P>
	Allied Capital&#146s first international investment was to a paging company that is expanding its operations throughout South America.  Allied Capital provided the company with $7 million in subordinated debt.

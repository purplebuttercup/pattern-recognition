Interests and Operating Policies</strong> </font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>REFAC</b> is very
selective in the technologies and products for which it
undertakes licensing responsibilities. In the United States and
abroad, we attempt to locate industrial technologies having
distinctively advantageous features that are protected by patents
and confidential know-how. Technologies submitted to REFAC are
evaluated on the basis of their proprietary features, innovative
merit, technological significance, competitive conditions and
earning potential.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In determining our interest in the
patent of a prospective client, we may become aware of various
products that appear to have a relationship to such patent. In
such event, we intensively investigate relevant issues of patent
validity and indicated infringement details. If we conclude that
there is substantial merit in the client's patent position, that
there is strong basis for concluding that infringement exists,
and that there is substantial economic value involved, serious
efforts are then made to license the manufacturer of such
product. Often these efforts are successful. If not, we may
consider it appropriate, with the client as co-plaintiff, to
initiate infringement litigation. </font></p>
<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000080">The following outlines the basic
    terms upon which REFAC undertakes a licensing responsibility: </font></p>
    <ul>
        <li><font color="#000080">Clients give REFAC the
            exclusive right to grant licenses covering products
            and processes covered by patents, copyrights, knowhow
            and/or trademarks in designated countries. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><font color="#000080">All licensing activities for
            clients are conducted entirely at REFAC's own risk
            and expense. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><font color="#000080">Gross income from license
            agreements is shared 50-50 between REFAC and its
            client. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><font color="#000080">If within a specified period of
            time, the client's income from REFAC's licensing
            activities does not reach a designated minimum
            amount, the client has the right to terminate the
            relationship. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><font color="#000080">In those instances where patent
            infringement litigation is commenced, clients are
            normally shielded from exposure for litigation costs. </font></li>
    </ul>

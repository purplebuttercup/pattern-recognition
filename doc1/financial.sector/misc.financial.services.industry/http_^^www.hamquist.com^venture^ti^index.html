         <P>TI Ventures, L.P. is a venture capital fund established
         by H&amp;Q and <A HREF="http://www.ti.com/"
         TARGET="new">Texas Instruments</A> to invest in early-stage
         communications companies, with an emphasis on DSP-related
         technologies.
         
         <P>In today's technology industry, emerging growth companies
         are faced with fierce competition, not only from established
         industry leaders, but also from other early-stage companies.
         Therefore, in recent years H&amp;Q Venture Capital has
         evolved its business to incorporate an even more value-added
         approach.
         
         <P>As venture capital investors, our greatest concern is the
         success of the companies we finance. Therefore, we are
         working with industry-leading corporations to establish
         dedicated venture capital partnerships. Through these funds,
         H&amp;Q Venture Capital and its partners bring to the table
         more than just early-stage finance capital; we are able to
         provide our <A HREF="portfolio.html">portfolio companies</A>
         with access to the technical and market resources of our
         industry partners as well as to the financial network of
         H&amp;Q's investment banking operations.
         
         <P>As the United States' second largest semiconductor
         company, Texas Instruments maintains vital interests in a
         diverse range of technologies, products, and markets. TI
         holds a market-leading position in the supply of components
         and systems for the communications and computing industries.
         TI's leadership in the field of DSPs makes it an ideal
         partner in the development of products for the wireless,
         networking, and storage industries.
         
         <P>As semiconductors are absorbing more and more of the
         functionality of an overall system, TI needs to be able to
         better understand the needs of both end users and equipment
         vendors. Through TI Ventures, Texas Instruments is able to
         participate in new markets and businesses that are beyond
         the traditional reach of its operations. As TI Ventures
         augments TI's direct strategic partnership programs, TI is
         also able to work closely with early-stage companies whose
         strategic connection to the corporation is less direct.

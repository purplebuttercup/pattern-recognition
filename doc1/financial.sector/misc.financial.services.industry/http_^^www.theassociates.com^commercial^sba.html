<H4><I>Small Business is Bigger Than You Think</I></H4>

According to SBA standards, over 90% of all U.S. 
corporations are classified as small businesses. 
And most of these companies are eligible for SBA 
loans, including manufacturing, wholesale, retail 
and service companies, both independent and 
franchised. The following guidelines can give you 
some idea of what size businesses are eligible:<br>

<UL>
<LI> Retail & Service - Annual sales $5 million - $21.5 million<br>
<LI> Wholesale Distribution - 100 employees<br>
<LI> Manufacturing - 500 to 1,500 employees<br>
<LI> Construction - Annual sales $7 million - $17 million<br>
<LI> Agriculture - Annual sales $500,000 to $9 million<br>
</UL>



<H4><I>The Associates, The SBA and You</I></H4> 

The Associates is more than an authorized SBA lender. 
We're an authorized lender who specializes in 
securing SBA loans for the following small business 
categories:<BR>

<UL>
<LI> Truck Dealers<br>
<LI> Trucking Companies<br>
<LI> General Contractors<br>
<LI> Warehousing Companies<br>
<LI> Equipment Rental Companies<br>
<LI> Light Construction / Agricultural Equipment Dealers<br>
<LI> Heavy Construction Equipment Distributors<br>
<LI> Machine Tool Shops<br>
<LI> Light Manufacturing Companies<br>
<LI> Manufactured Housing Retailers<br>
<LI> Communications Companies<br>
<LI> Communication Equipment Dealers<br>
</UL>

Because we specialize in these industry categories 
(and have for over 75 years), we're staffed with 
experts who know your competitive environment, 
your capital needs, even your seasonal fluctuations. 
Armed with this kind of professional knowledge, 
we can go about structuring the best SBA loan 
for your situation.

<H4><I>Many Different Loans and Terms Available</I></H4>

As opposed to typical business loans, The Associates 
SBA loans can offer higher loan-to-value ratios and 
longer terms (up to 25 years). Loans can be fully 
amortized for seven to 25 years, depending on use. 
And there are no balloon payments or prepayment 
penalties.<p>

Interest rates are generally indexed to no more 
than 2.75% above Prime Rate as quoted in <I>The 
Wall Street Journal</I>.<p>

With a maximum amount of $1.2 million, depending on 
use, your loan can be designed to fund a single 
purchase, or a combination of needs, including:

<UL>
<LI> Business Acquisition<br>
<LI> Building Acquisition, Improvement or Construction<br>
<LI> Purchasing Machinery, Equipment, Furniture, and Fixtures<br>
<LI> Purchase of Inventory<br>
<LI> Working Capital<br>
<LI> Debt Refinancing<br>
</UL>

<H4><I>Applying is Easier Than You Think</I></H4>

Although an SBA loan from The Associates doesn't 
require much more paperwork than a conventional 
loan, our staff is always ready to answer questions 
and provide assistance. We can even assign one of 
our professionals to walk you through the entire 
application. However, because Small Business Loans 
from The Associates are guaranteed, the SBA has 
established general guidelines. For example: owner 
investment in a new business or project should 
generally be a minimum of 20-40%; owner management 
should be actively involved; personal guarantees 
are generally required of principals owning 20% or 
more of the business; a credit history should be 
available on all principals; adequate collateral 
is generally expected; and the ability to repay 
should be shown by historical and projected data.<p>

<h4>Royce Global Services Fund</h4>
<h3>Supplement to Prospectus dated April 30, 1997</h4>

At a Special Meeting held on November 25, 1997, Shareholders of <b>Royce
Global Services Fund</b> (the &quot;Fund&quot;) approved a proposal to change the
Fund's investment objective and a related policy to permit the Fund to
concentrate its investments in the financial services industry.  The
Fund's new investment objective is long-term capital appreciation by
investing primarily in common stocks and convertible securities of
companies principally engaged in the financial services industry.

With this approval, the Fund's name has been changed to
<b>Royce Financial Services Fund</b> and the Fund has amended its
non-fundamental investment policies to eliminate the requirement that
more than 65% of its assets be invested in securities of companies from
at least three countries, which may include the United States.<p>

You cannot open a <b>Royce Financial Services</b> account through this
prospectus and application.  Please call 1-800-221-4268 for a separate
Prospectus and Application for <b>Royce Financial Services Fund</b>.<p>
<hr>
<h4>Royce Total Return Fund</h4>
<h4>Supplement to Prospectus dated April 30, 1997</h4>
In accordance with its dual objective of capital appreciation (realized and unrealized) and current
income, Royce Total Return Fund will normally invest at least 65% of its assets in common stocks
and convertible securities. At least 90% of these securities will be income-producing and at least 65% will be issued
by companies with stock market capitalizations under $1 billion at the time of investment. The remainder
of the Fund's assets may be invested in securities with higher stock market capitalizations, non-dividend-paying 
common stocks and non-convertible securities. While most of the Fund's securities will be income-producing,
the composite yield of the Fund will vary and may be either higher or lower than the composite yield of the stocks
in the S&amp;P 500.<p>

<h4>Royce GiftShares Fund (Investment Class)</h4>
<h4>Supplement to Prospectus dated April 30, 1997</h4>
In accordance with its investment objective of long-term capital
appreciation, Royce GiftShares Fund will normally invest at least 65%
of its assets in a limited number of common stocks
and convertible securities. At least 75% of these securities will be
issued
by small (under $1 billion in market capitalization) and micro-cap
(under $300 million) companies. The
remainder
of the Fund's assets may be invested in securities of companies with higher 
market capitalizations and non-convertible preferred stocks and
debt securities. <p>
September 25, 1997<p>
<hr>
<h4>Royce GiftShares Fund (Consultant Class)</h4>
<h4>Supplement to Prospectus dated June 15, 1997</h4>
In accordance with its investment objective of long-term capital
appreciation, Royce GiftShares Fund will normally invest at least 65%
of its assets in a limited number of common stocks
and convertible securities. At least 75% of these securities will be
issued
by small (under $1 billion in market capitalization) and micro-cap
(under $300 million) companies. The
remainder
of the Fund's assets may be invested in securities of companies with higher
market capitalizations and non-convertible preferred stocks and
debt securities. <p>

<h4>NOTICE TO ROYCE MICRO-CAP FUND INVESTORS</h4>

In order to control asset growth, the Trust has committed to limit
<b>Royce
Micro-Cap Fund</b>'s net cash inflows to $50 million in any calendar six
month period.  Once the $50 million is reached, the Fund will close to
new investors and advisers for the remainder of the period, but will
remain open to existing relationships.<p>

The Fund's Investment Adviser has agreed to waive its management fee to
the extent necessary to cap the expense ratio of <b>Royce Micro-Cap
Fund</b> at
1.49% for 1997 and through December 31, 1998, reflecting its continued
commitment to lower expense ratios.<p>

<td WIDTH="70%">The relative risk of investing in a particular fund should be
considered in addition to the total returns of the fund. Risk, in terms of how
volatile an investor's returns have been, can be measured in a number of ways,
including standard deviation and beta.
<br><br><b>Standard deviation</b> measures the range of performance within
which a fund's total returns have fallen. The lower the standard deviation of
the fund the less volatile and more consistent the fund's monthly total returns
have been over that period. When the standard deviation of a fund is lower than
the standard deviation of an index such as the S&amp;P 500, the fund has been
less volatile than the index.
<br><br><b>Beta</b> measures a fund's sensitivity to market movements. The
beta for the index generally chosen to represent the market (the S&amp;P 500) is
1.00. If the fund has a beta greater than 1.00, it has been more volatile than
the index; if its beta is less than 1.00, it has been less volatile than the
index.
<br><br>These measures of risk, which are historical in nature and not
necessarily predictive of future volatility, are more fully described in the
Statement of Additional Information. For the three year period ended December
31, 1996, standard deviation and beta for the Funds, the Russell 2000, an index

<p>Royce uses a &quot;value&quot; method in managing the Funds' assets. In its
selection process, Royce puts primary emphasis on the understanding of various
internal returns  indicative of profitability, balance sheet quality, cash flows
and the relationships  that these factors have to the price of a given security.

</p>
<p>Royce's value method is based on its belief that the securities of certain
small companies may sell at a discount from its estimate of such companies' &quot;private
worth,&quot; that is, what a knowledgeable buyer would pay for the entire
company. Royce attempts to identify and invest in these securities for each of
the Funds, with the expectation that this &quot;value discount&quot; will narrow
over time and thus provide capital appreciation for the Funds.
</p>
<p><b>Royce Premier Fund</b>
<br>Normally, Royce Premier Fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in a
limited number of common stocks, convertible preferred stocks and convertible
bonds. At least 65% of these securities will be income-producing and/or issued
by companies with stock market capitalizations under $1 billion at the time of
investment. The remainder of its assets may be invested in securities of
companies with higher stock market capitalizations, non-dividend-paying common
stocks and non-convertible preferred stocks and debt securities. In its
selection process for the Fund, Royce puts primary emphasis on companies with
market capitalizations between $300 million and $1 billion which have unusually
strong returns on assets, cash flows and balance sheets or unusual business
strengths and/or prospects. Other characteristics, such as a company's growth
potential and valuation considerations, are also used in selecting the Fund's
investments.</p>
<p><b>Royce Micro-Cap Fund</b>
<br>At least 80% of the assets of Royce Micro-Cap Fund will normally be
invested in common stocks and securities convertible into common stocks of small
and micro-cap companies, and at least 65% of these securities will be issued by
companies with stock market capitalizations under $300 million at the time of
investment. The remainder of its assets may be invested in securities of
companies with higher stock market capitalizations and non-convertible preferred
stocks and debt securities.
</p>
<p><b>Pennsylvania Mutual Fund and PMF II</b>
<br>Each of these Funds normally invests at least 65% of its assets in common
stocks and securities convertible into common stocks. Approximately equal
weightings of small and micro-cap companies (stock market capitalizations below
$1 billion) are included in the Funds' portfolios. In the upper end of this
range, $300 million to $1 billion in stock market capitalization, the Funds
focus on a limited number of companies with superior financial characteristics
and/or unusually attractive business prospects, companies Royce classifies as &quot;premier.&quot;
The Funds also focus on companies at the lower end of the range, below $300
million, the sector known as &quot;micro-cap.&quot;
</p>
<p><b>Royce GiftShares Fund</b>
<br>Royce GiftShares Fund will normally invest at least 80% of its assets in a
limited number of common stocks and convertible securities. At least 75% of
these securities will be issued by small (under $1 billion in market
capitalization) and micro-cap (under $300 million) companies. The remainder of
its assets may be invested in securities of companies with higher market
capitalizations and non-convertible preferred stocks and debt securities.
</p>
<p>Investments in Royce GiftShares Fund are suitable for making long-term gifts
which may qualify for the Federal annual gift tax exclusion and which may also
be designed to help fund the beneficiary's college and post-graduate education.
See &quot;Royce GiftShares Fund Investors&quot; below for further information.
</p>
<p><b>Royce Total Return Fund</b>
<br>In accordance with its dual objective of capital appreciation (realized and
unrealized) and current income, Royce Total Return Fund will normally invest at
least 80% of its assets in common stocks. At least 90% of these securities will
be dividend-paying, and at least 65% of these securities will be issued by
companies with stock market capitalizations under $1 billion at the time of
investment. The remainder of the Fund's assets may be invested in securities
with higher stock market capitalizations, non-dividend-paying common stocks and
convertible and non-convertible securities. While most of the Fund's securities
will be income-producing, the composite yield of the Fund will vary and may be
either higher or lower than the composite yield of the stocks in the S&amp;P
500.
</p>
<p><b>Royce Low-Priced Stock Fund</b>
<br>Normally, Royce Low-Priced Stock Fund will invest at least 65% of its
assets in common stocks and convertible securities of companies with shares that
trade at prices below $15 at the time of investment. In addition, at least 65%
of these securities will be issued by companies with market capitalizations
under $1 billion at the time of investment. In determining whether a convertible
security is low-priced, Royce may consider either the price of the convertible
security itself or the price of the security into which it is convertible. The
remainder of its assets may be invested in stocks of companies with higher
prices or higher market capitalizations and non-convertible preferred stocks and
debt securities.
</p>
<p><b>Royce Global Services Fund</b>
<br>Royce Global Services Fund normally invests at least 65% of its assets in
the common stocks, convertible securities and warrants of domestic and foreign
companies &quot;principally&quot; engaged in service industries. Service
industries may include: banking, insurance, securities, investment management,
advertising, communication, consulting, distribution, engineering,
environmental, health, leisure, security services, printing and publishing,
retail, food services, software and computer services, transportation services
and such other industries as Royce may from time to time determine to be service
industries. For these purposes, a company is deemed to be &quot;principally&quot;
engaged in a service industry if, as of the end of or for its most recent fiscal
year, at least 50% of its consolidated assets, revenues or net income are
committed to, or are derived from, service related activities.
</p>
<p>Royce Global Services Fund normally invests more than 65% of its assets in
securities of companies from at least three countries, which may include the
United States. In most instances, investments are made in companies principally
based in the United States or the other developed countries of North America,
Europe, Asia and Australia and not in emerging market countries.
</p>
<p>Royce Global Services Fund may also indirectly invest in the securites of
domestic and foreign service and non-service companies by investing up to 20% of
its assets in the securites of other investment companies that invest primarily
in such companies. The other investment companies in which the Fund may invest
may be domestic companies registered under the 1940 Act or foreign companies
that are not so registered or otherwise regulated. They usually have their own
management fees and expenses, and Royce will also earn its fee on Fund assets
invested in such other companies, which would result in a duplication of fees to
the extent of any such investment. However, Royce will waive its management fee
on any Fund assests invested in other open-end investment companies, and no
sales charge will be borne by the Fund in connection with such an investment.
</p>
<p>The assets of the Fund that are not required to be invested in the equity
securities of companies engaged in service industries may be invested in the
common stocks, convertible securities and warrants of companies engaged in
non-service industries and/or in non-convertible preferred stocks and debt
securities.

</b>
<p>The Funds are
<br>subject to certain
<br>investment risks
</p></td>
<td VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="70%">
<p>As mutual funds investing primarily in common stocks and/or securities
convertible into common stocks, the Funds are subject to market risk; that is,
the possibility that common stock prices will decline over short or even
extended periods. The Funds invest substantial portions of their assets in
securities of small and/or micro-cap companies. Such companies may not be
well-known to the investing public, may not have significant institutional
ownership and may have cyclical, static or only moderate growth prospects. In
addition, the securities of such companies may be more volatile in price, have
wider spreads between their bid and ask prices and have significantly lower
trading volumes than larger capitalization stocks. Thus, purchases and sales of
such securities may have a greater impact on their market prices than would be
the case with larger capitalization stocks. Accordingly, Royce's investment
focus requires a long-term horizon, and the Funds should not be used to play
short-term swings in the market.
</p>
<p>Although <b>Royce Premier</b> and <b>GiftShares Funds</b> are diversified
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the &quot;1940 Act&quot;),
they will normally be invested in a limited number of securities. The Funds'
relatively limited portfolios may involve more risk than investing in other
Royce Funds or in a broadly diversified portfolio of common stocks of large and
well-known companies. To the extent that the Funds invest in a limited number of
securities, they may be more susceptible to any single corporate, economic,
political or regulatory occurrence than a more widely diversified fund.
</p>
<p><b>Pennsylvania Mutual Fund, PMF II, Royce Micro-Cap, Low-Priced Stock</b>
and <b>GiftShares Funds</b> invest substantially in micro-cap and/or low-priced
securities that are followed by relatively few securities analysts, with the
result that there tends to be less publicly available information concerning the
securities. The securities of these companies may have more limited trading
volumes and be subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than the
securities of small-cap companies, higher priced securities and/or the market
averages in general, and Royce may be required to deal with only a few
market-makers when purchasing and selling these securities.  Companies in which
these Funds are likely to invest also may have limited product lines, markets or
financial resources, may lack management depth and may be more vulnerable to
adverse business or market developments. Thus, these Funds may involve
considerably more risk than a mutual fund investing in more liquid equity
securities.
</p>
<p><b>Royce Low-Priced Stock Fund</b> may invest in securities of issuers of
low-priced stocks which are financially distressed or involved in bankruptcy,
liquidation, reorganization or recapitalization proceedings. Specifically
because of their lower prices relative to other companies, low-priced securities
may be subject to even more abrupt or erratic market movements.
</p>
<p><b>Royce Global Services Fund</b> does not concentrate its investments by
investing more than 25% of its assets in the securities of companies principally
engaged in any one industry, including banking, insurance, securities and
investment management. However, because more than 25% of its assets may be
invested in companies engaged collectively in the banking, insurance, securities
and investment management industries, the Fund may, to that extent, be deemed to
be concentrating its investments in a group consisting of such industries.
Financial service companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation.
This may limit both the amounts and types of loans and other financial
commitments that such companies are permitted to make, and, in the case of banks
and insurance companies, the interest, fees and premiums they are permitted to
charge. Insurance companies are particularly subject to rate setting, potential
anti-trust and tax law changes and industry-wide pricing and competition cycles
and may be affected by catastrophes and/or reinsurance carrier failures. Also,
the profitability of many types of financial service companies is largely
dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and may fluctuate
significantly when interest rates change.
</p>
<p>General economic conditions are important to the operation of most financial
service companies, and credit losses resulting from financial difficulties of
borrowers may negatively impact some of them. Changes in regulations, broker
commission structure and securities market activities, together with the
leverage and trading strategies employed by broker-dealers and investment banks,
may produce erratic returns for them over time. Finally, most types of financial
service companies are subject to substantial price and other competition. Prices
of the securities of domestic and foreign financial service companies may be
more volatile than those of more broadly diversified investments, and the Fund's
performance may be tied to the financial services industries and the United
States and world economies as a whole. The securities of financial service
companies may react similarly to market conditions and may move together.

<td VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="30%"><b>Foreign Securities</b></td>
<td VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="70%">
<p>Royce Global Services Fund has no restrictions on the amount of its assets
that may be invested in foreign securities. PMF II may invest up to 25% of its
assets in foreign securities, and each of the other Funds may invest up to 10%
of its assets in foreign securities, measured at the time of purchase.
</p>
<p>The Funds may purchase securities of foreign companies in the form of
American Depositary Receipts (&quot;ADRs&quot;). ADRs are certificates held in
trust by a bank or similar financial institution evidencing ownership of shares
of a foreign-based issuer. Designed for use in U.S. securities markets, ADRs are
alternatives to the purchase of the underlying foreign securities in their
national markets and currencies.
</p>
<p>The Funds do not expect to purchase or sell foreign currencies to hedge
against declines in the U.S. dollar or to lock in the value of the foreign
securities they purchase, and their foreign investments may be adversely
affected by changes in foreign currency rates. Consequently, the risks
associated with such investments may be greater than if the Funds did engage in
foreign currency transactions for hedging purposes. Foreign investments may also
be adversely affected by exchange control regulations, if any, in such foreign
markets, and the Funds' ability to make certain distributions necessary to
maintain eligibility as a regulated investment company and avoid the imposition
of income and excise taxes may to that extent be limited.
</p>
<p>There may be less information available about a foreign company than a
domestic company; foreign companies may not be subject to accounting, auditing
and reporting standards and requirements comparable to those applicable to
domestic companies; and foreign markets, brokers and issuers are generally
subject to less extensive government regulation than their domestic
counterparts. Foreign securities may be less liquid and may be subject to
greater price volatility than domestic securities. Foreign brokerage commissions
and custodial fees are generally higher than those in the United States. Foreign
markets also have different clearance and settlement procedures, and in certain
markets there have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace
with the volume of securities transactions, thereby making it difficult to
conduct such transactions. Delays or problems with settlements might afect the
liquidity of the Fund's portfolio. Foreign investments may also be subject to
local economic and political risks, political instability and possible
nationalization of issuers or expropriation of their assets, which might
adversely affect the Fund's ability to realize on its investment in such
securities. Furthermore, some foreign securities are subject to brokerage taxes
levied by foreign governments, which have the effect of increasing the cost of
such investment and reducing the realized gain or increasing the realized loss
on such securities at the time of sale.
</p>
<p>Income earned or received by the Funds from sources within foreign countries
may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by such countries. Any
such taxes paid by the Funds will reduce their cash available for distribution
to shareholders. The Funds are required to calculate their distributable income
and capital gains for U.S. Federal income tax purposes by reference to the U.S.
dollar. Fluctuations in applicable foreign currency exchange rates may cause a
Fund's distributable income and capital gains for U.S. Federal income tax
purposes to differ from the value of its investments calculated by reference to
foreign currencies. If a Fund invests in stock of a so-called passive foreign
investment company, the Fund may make certain elections that will affect the
calculation of its net investment income and capital gains.

Corp., the Funds' investment adviser, is responsible for the management of their
assets, subject to the authority of the Board. Charles M. Royce, Royce's
President, Chief Investment Officer and sole voting shareholder since 1972, is
primarily responsible for managing the Funds' portfolios. He is assisted by
Royce's investment staff, including W. Whitney George, Portfolio Manager and
Managing Director, and by Jack E. Fockler, Jr., Managing Director.
</p>
<p>As compensation for its services to the Funds, Royce is entitled to receive
the following annual advisory fees: (i) 1% of the first $50 million of
Pennsylvania Mutual Fund's average net assets, .875% of the next $50 million of
its average net assets and .75% of its average net assets in excess of $100
million; (ii) 1% of the average net assets of PMF II, Royce Premier and Total

Low-Priced Stock and Global Services Funds; and (iv) 1.25% of the average net
assets of Royce GiftShares Fund. For 1996, the fees paid to Royce on average net
assets were .97%, 1.43%, .76%, .30% and 1.07% (net of voluntary waivers) for
Royce Premier, Micro-Cap, Pennsylvania Mutual, Total Return and Low-Priced Stock
Funds, respectively. The fees for PMF II, Royce GiftShares and Global Services
Funds were voluntarily waived by Royce.
</p>
<p>Royce selects the brokers who execute the purchases and sales of the Funds'
portfolio securities and may place orders with brokers who provide brokerage and
research services to Royce. Royce is authorized, in recognition of the value of
brokerage and research services provided, to pay commissions to a broker in

Royce Total Return, Low-Priced Stock and Global Services Funds pursuant to Rule
12b-1. The plan provides for payment to RFS of .25% per annum of the average net

<p>The Royce Fund (the &quot;Trust&quot;) is a Delaware business trust,
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a diversified open-end
management investment company. It is the successor to a Massachusetts business
trust established in October 1985 and merged into the Trust in June 1996, when
Pennsylvania Mutual Fund was also merged into the Trust as a separate series.
Pennsylvania Mutual Fund previously operated for more than 20 years as a
Royce-advised diversified open-end management investment company. The Trustees
have the authority to issue an unlimited number of shares of beneficial
interest, without shareholder approval, and these shares may be divided into an
unlimited number of series or classes. Shareholders are entitled to one vote per
share. Shares vote by individual series on all matters, except that shares are
voted in the aggregate and not by individual series when required by the 1940
Act and that if the Trustees determine that a matter affects only one series or
class, then only shareholders of that series or class are entitled to vote on
that matter.
</p>
<p>The Trust's Board of Trustees has approved a plan creating two classes of
shares for Royce GiftShares Fund, an Investment Class and a Consultant Class. In
connection with this plan, the Trust has called a special meeting of the Fund's
shareholders to be held on May 28, for the purpose of approving a 12b-1 plan and
.25% per annum distribution fee for the Fund's existing shares, which would be
offset by reducing the Fund's management fee from 1.25% to 1.00% per annum of
the Fund's average net assets. When these plans are implemented, the Fund's
existing shares would be designated as the Investment Class, and Consultant
Class shares would be offered to customers of certain broker-dealers by separate
prospectus.
</p>
<p>Meetings of shareholders will not be held except as required by the 1940 Act
or other applicable law. A meeting will be held to vote on the removal of a
Trustee or Trustees of the Trust if requested in writing by the holders of not
less than 10% of the outstanding shares of the Trust.
</p>
<p>The custodian for securities, cash and other assets of the Funds is State
Street Bank and Trust Company. State Street, through its agent National
Financial Data Services (&quot;NFDS&quot;), also serves as the Funds' Transfer
Agent. Coopers &amp; Lybrand L.L.P. serves as independent accountants for the
Funds.

<p>A Royce GiftShares Fund investment is a unique way to make a gift to a child
(minor or adult) or another individual. (You may not open an account in
GiftShares Fund for yourself or your spouse.) A GiftShares Fund investment is
suitable for making a long-term gift which may qualify in whole or in part for
the Federal annual gift tax exclusion and which may also be designed to help
fund the beneficiary's college and post-graduate education. To open a GiftShares
Fund account, call Investor Information (1-800-221-4268) for a GiftShares
Information Packet. (A GiftShares Fund account may also be opened by a trustee
for an individual or organization if the trust has a long-term duration, the
provisions of the trust instrument are acceptable to the Trust and the trustee
has his, her or its own tax adviser.) The minimum initial investment in
GiftShares Fund is $5,000.
</p>
<p>Additional investments may be made in amounts of $50 or more at any time
during the existence of the trust.
</p>
<p>The shares in a GiftShares Fund account are held in trust for the
beneficiary by State Street Bank and Trust Company, as independent trustee,
until the termination date you specify. The duration of the trust may be as long
as you wish, but generally must be at least 10 years from the time you make the
first contribution to the GiftShares Fund trust or until the beneficiary reaches
the age of majority, whichever is later. The GiftShares Fund trust is
irrevocable, and neither you nor the beneficiary may amend its terms in any way.
When the trust terminates, the beneficiary will receive the shares in the
account. The beneficiary may then continue to own the shares, but, except for
reinvestment of distributions, may not purchase additional shares.
</p>
<p>Options available to a donor under the Royce GiftShares Fund trust adoption
agreement are:
</p>
<p><b>Withdrawal Option:
</b></p>
<p>This option will be used primarily by a donor to make a gift that may
qualify for the Federal annual gift tax exclusion or when the donor wants to
allow the beneficiary to make withdrawals from the trust to pay for higher
education and related costs.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The full amount of the gift may qualify for the Federal annual gift tax
exclusion </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>The trust may be designed to permit withdrawals to help fund the
beneficiary's college or post-graduate education
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>The beneficiary will be taxed on all of the trust's income and capital
gains, and the trustee will, if requested by the beneficiary, redeem Fund shares
in order to allow for withdrawals in order for the beneficiary to pay these
taxes
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>The trustee will send an information statement to the beneficiary each
year, showing the amount of income and capital gains to be reported on his or
her income tax returns for that year
</li></ul>
<p><b>Accumulation Option:
</b></p>
<p>This option should generally be used by a donor who is not concerned about
the Federal annual gift tax exclusion and who does not want the beneficiary to
be required to pay the taxes on the trust's income or capital gains or to file
tax returns.
</p>
<ul>
<li>No part of the gift qualifies for the Federal annual gift tax exclusion
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>The trust will be taxed on all income and capital gains in excess of $100
per year
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>The trustee of the trust will prepare and file all Federal and state income
tax returns that are required each year, and will pay the taxes from the assets
of the trust by redeeming Fund shares
</li></ul>
<p><b>Split Option:
</b></p>
<p>This option generally is for a donor who wants to use a portion of the
Federal annual gift tax exclusion and wants the trust to pay the taxes on its
capital gains.
</p>
<ul>
<li>A portion of the gift may qualify for the Federal annual gift tax exclusion

</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>The trust will be taxed on its capital gains, and the trustee will pay the

<p>Each of the Funds pays dividends from net investment income (if any) and
distributes its net realized capital gains annually in December. Dividends and
distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Fund
unless the shareholder chooses otherwise.</p>
<p>Shareholders receive information annually as to the tax status of
distributions made by each Fund for the calendar year. For Federal income tax
purposes, all distributions by a Fund are taxable to shareholders when declared,
whether received in cash or reinvested in shares. Distributions paid from a
Fund's net investment income and short-term capital gains are taxable to
shareholders as ordinary income dividends. A portion of a Fund's dividends may
qualify for the corporate dividends-received deduction, subject to certain
limitations. The portion of a Fund's dividends qualifying for such deduction is
generally limited to the aggregate taxable dividends received by the Fund from
domestic corporations. Distributions paid from long-term capital gains of a Fund
are treated by a shareholder for Federal income tax purposes as long-term
capital gains, regardless of how long a shareholder has held Fund shares.
</p>
<p>If a shareholder disposes of shares held for six months or less at a loss,
such loss will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any
long-term capital gains reported by the shareholder with respect to such shares.
A loss realized on a taxable disposition of Fund shares may be disallowed to the
extent that additional Fund shares are purchased (including by reinvestment of
distributions) within 30 days before or after such distribution.
</p>
<p>The redemption of shares is a taxable event, and a shareholder may realize a
capital gain or capital loss. Each Fund will report to redeeming shareholders
the proceeds of their redemptions. However, because the tax consequences of a
redemption will also depend on the shareholder's basis in the redeemed shares
for tax purposes, shareholders should retain their account statements for use in
determining their tax liability on a redemption.
</p>
<p>At the time of a shareholder's purchase, a Fund's net asset value may
reflect undistributed income or capital gains. A subsequent distribution of
these amounts by a Fund will be taxable to the shareholder even though the
distribution economically is a return of part of the shareholder's investment.
</p>
<p>The Funds are required to withhold 31% of taxable dividends, capital gain
distributions and redemptions paid to non-corporate shareholders who have not
complied with Internal Revenue Service taxpayer identification regulations.
Shareholders may avoid this withholding requirement by certifying on the Account
Application Form their proper Social Security or Taxpayer Identification Number
and certifying that they are not subject to backup withholding.
</p>
<p>The discussion of Federal income taxes above is for general information
only. Shareholders may also be subject to state and local taxes on income and
gains from their investment. Investors should consult their own tax advisers
concerning the tax consequences of an investment in the Funds. The Statement of
Additional Information includes a more detailed description of Federal income
tax aspects that may be relevant to a shareholder.

<p>Early Redemption
<br>Fee</p></td>
<td VALIGN="TOP">
<p>In order to discourage short-term trading, the Funds assess an early
redemption fee of 1% on redemptions of share purchases held for less than one
year. Purchases of Fund shares prior to July 1, 1996 are exempt from the fee.
Redemption fees will be paid to the Fund, out of the redemption proceeds
otherwise payable to the shareholder, to help offset transaction costs.</p>
<p>The Funds will use the &quot;first-in, first-out&quot; (FIFO) method to
determine the one-year holding period. Under this method, the date of the
redemption will be compared with the earliest purchase date of the share
purchases held in the account. If this holding period is less than one year, the
fee will be assessed. In determining &quot;one year&quot;, the Funds will use
the anniversary month of a transaction. Thus, shares purchased in August 1997,
for example, will be subject to the fee if they are redeemed prior to August
1998. If they are redeemed on or after August 1, 1998, they will not be subject
to the fee.</p>
<p>No redemption fee will be payable on shares acquired through reinvestment,
on an exchange into another Royce Fund or by shareholders who are (a) employees
of the Trust or Royce or members of their immediate families or employee benefit
plans for them, (b) current participants in an Automatic Investment Plan or an
Automatic Withdrawal Plan, (c) certain Trust-approved Group Investment Plans and
charitable organizations, (d) profit-sharing trusts, corporations or other

<font size="+1"><ul>
<li><b>One of the Most Well-Respected and Oldest Small-Cap Investment Managers With a Value Orientation</b> -
 We are an independent small-cap manager with over 20 years of investment management experience. Based
 in New York, <b><i>Royce</i></b> has more than $2 billion in total assets under management -  <i>all</i> focused on small
 and micro-cap value investing. We offer a full range of small-cap open-end mutual funds and closed-end funds, 
providing investors and advisors with a wide variety of small-cap alternatives.<p>  
<li><b>Dedicated Professionals with a Singular Focus</b> - Over the last 20 years, we have built
substantial trading and research relationships in an attempt to provide shareholders with the best
possible small-cap portfolios available. Our time-tested investment approach is 
supported by 12 professionals. Charles M. 
Royce, Chief Investment Officer, remains the primary portfolio manager.<p>  
<li><b>Realistic Expectations and Consistent Results</b> - Royce Premier, Royce Total Return and Pennsylvania Mutual Fund are consistently 
ranked among the &quot;lowest risk&quot; small-cap equity funds, including Royce Premier, Royce Total Return and Pennsylvania Mutual funds. We offer a systematic and disciplined investment approach that avoids style
 and capitalization drift. All the funds seek to provide above average full market cycle total returns
 with below average risk.<p> 
<li><b>Co-Ownership  of Funds</b> - We believe it is important for our employees' financial 
interests to be congruent with our shareholders' financial interests. The Firm's principals and 
employees currently have more than $30 million invested in the Funds.<p> 

</font><font color="#000000" size="+1"><i>&quot;Our experience tells us that when a disciplined value approach is combined with small company 
investing, above average returns with lower volatility are possible. This core belief has formed the 
basis for our approach which emphasizes risk management and consistency of application. We believe 
that a system for rational decision making, whose basic premise is that the price one pays for an 
investment makes a significant difference in the returns one receives, is more important than ever.&quot;</i>

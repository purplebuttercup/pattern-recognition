	MLC has created a unique <font color="#000088"><b>Vendor Finance Program 
	</b></font>that combines a cost/benefit analysis with our historically 
	creative financial solutions to help our customers improve sales 
	productivity and provide a competitive advantage. <p>

	<font color="#660033" size=4><b>
	Program Benefits</b></font><p>

	Working with vendors throughout the information technology industry, 
	MLC helps provide flexible financing to your customers. We remain the 
	very best at providing leasing expertise and solutions for client 
	companies in our targeted industries and are unmatched in program 
	availability, services offered, and overall capability. <p>

	MLC provides an efficient, easily implemented solution for companies 
	that need the benefit of an in-house, dedicated equipment leasing 
	group but do not want to directly bear the cost associated with 
	acquiring that capability and expertise. The MLC solution can be 
	transparent to the sales people and clients of the companies we 
	serve; under a <font color="#000088"><b>Private Label</b></font> approach
	the vendor's name appears on all financing documents with the 
	customer, even though the service is provided by a third party; 
	this simplifies the transaction for your customer.<p>

	A private label approach where the vendor is the contractual 
	interface with the customer provides two primary benefits:<br>&nbsp;</td></tr>

	Our strength and focus in this area is an understanding of, and the
	ability to, finance non-traditional assets such as software, 
	services, and maintenance/warranty agreements -- a vision we 
	believe is <font color="#000088"><b>the future of information 
	technology financing.</b></font> In addition to mainframes and 
	peripherals, we finance used equipment, networks, and distributed 
	systems. MLC also provides lease financing for the more traditional 
	hard assets.<p>

	<font color="#660033" face="arial, helvetica" size=4><b>
	Legal/Contractual Expertise</b></font><p>

	Like any business transaction, the details of the lease 
	or financing agreement are important and can have a profound effect
	on the lessee both in terms of cost and flexibility. Experience
	has placed MLC on both sides of contract negotiations and we've
	developed an impressive amount of expertise in the critical areas
	of documentation and protection of the interests of all parties. We
	thoroughly research the customers' present and future needs
	so that maximum flexibility and minimum costs are obtained. Leasing
	is a binding legal arrangement in which all issues must be
	thoroughly examined: MLC's precision is invaluable during this
	process.<p>

    <h2><font face="Arial">Bill Elliott and Dan Marino to Join Forces For 1998 NASCAR Winston
    Cup Season</font></h2>
    <h3><font face="Arial">FIRSTPLUS FINANCIAL, Inc. Primary Sponsor of New Car</font></h3>
    <p><!--prnews|879885900--> <!-- TextStart --> </p>
    <p><font face="Arial">NFL All-Pro quarterback Dan Marino has entered into an agreement
    with NASCAR veteran Bill Elliott to jointly own the second car on the Elliott team for the
    1998 NASCAR Winston Cup season. Under the ownership of Elliott-Marino Motorsports, the new
    entry will make its' debut at the Daytona International Speedway on February 15. Jerry
    Nadeau will be the driver of the Elliott-Marino car. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">FIRSTPLUS FINANCIAL, Inc. the Dallas-based specialized consumer
    finance company, will be the primary sponsor of the #13 Ford Taurus, Marino's uniform
    number throughout his Miami Dolphin career. The new team will continue FIRSTPLUS' interest
    in motorsports which began a year ago with the company's sponsorship of a team in the Indy
    Racing League and associate sponsorship of the Cartoon Network car. FIRSTPLUS was
    attracted to NASCAR racing because of its rapid growth in popularity and the opportunity
    to partner with Marino and Elliott. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">``From a business standpoint, NASCAR offers us the opportunity to be
    part of one of the fastest growing sports in the world today. That fact, along with the
    opportunity to partner with two legends in sports -- Dan Marino and Bill Elliott -- make
    it a great opportunity for FIRSTPLUS,'' said FIRSTPLUS Chairman and CEO Dan Phillips. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">``Last year, more than 148 million people watched Winston Cup races
    on television and another 5.6 million watched the races in person. We feel that the brand
    loyalty demonstrated by these fans and our special variety of home improvement and debt
    consolidation products will be a great fit,'' added Phillips. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">This is not the first opportunity for FIRSTPLUS to partner with
    Marino. Marino has served as the national spokesperson for FIRSTPLUS in all its television
    advertising for more than a year and is featured in the company's direct mail and
    marketing efforts. Marino also serves as chairman of FIRSTPLUS Sports Marketing, which
    supports FIRSTPLUS sales efforts through a variety of sports-related marketing venues. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">``I've been a fan of NASCAR for a long time and wanted to get
    involved in the sport at a very high level,'' said Marino. ``The opportunity to join with
    Bill Elliott, one of the superstars of the sport, while at the same time helping FIRSTPLUS
    increase its name awareness and meet its financial goals, is the perfect combination of
    business and pleasure for me.'' </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">``Dan and I became friends over the past several months and as that
    friendship grew, our mutual interest for a joint effort in racing emerged,'' said Elliott.
    ``This is an exciting opportunity for our team in Dawsonville (Ga.), to work with Dan and
    FIRSTPLUS FINANCIAL and build a successful program. We're looking forward to working with
    Dan Phillips and the entire FIRSTPLUS family as they grow their business through
    motorsports. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">``Dan Marino is a leader in the NFL, having rewritten the record
    book as a quarterback,'' Elliott added. ``FIRSTPLUS is a leader in consumer lending
    throughout the U.S. Partnered with this kind of leadership and ability, we think this
    program will grow to be a leader on the racetrack.'' </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Dan Marino has become a staple in American sports culture during his
    15 seasons in the National Football League. He has managed to re-write the NFL record book
    by establishing 20 records and positioning himself as the all-time leading passer in NFL
    history. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">His accomplishments to date include (through the 1996 season): NFL's
    all- time leader in touchdown passes (369), total yards passing (51,636), pass attempts
    (6,904) and pass completions (4,134). Now in his 15th consecutive season with the Miami
    Dolphins, Marino will continue his quest for his ultimate professional goal; a Super Bowl
    championship. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">With more than 20 years of NASCAR Winston Cup competition
    experience, Bill Elliott has accumulated 40 career victories, a Winston Cup Championship
    (1988) and was the first driver in NASCAR history to win the Winston Million, a $1 million
    bonus from R. J. Reynolds for winning three of the ``Big Four'' races in 1985; the Daytona
    500, the Winston 500 at Talladega (Ala.) and the Southern 500 at Darlington, S.C. In 1996,
    Elliott was voted NASCAR's ``Most Popular Driver'' for a record 11th time in a poll
    conducted by the National Motorsports Press Association (NMPA). This placed Elliott in an
    individual category as the most popular driver in the history of the sport. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Jerry Nadeau, 27, brings to Elliott-Marino Motorsports valuable
    experience in road racing and open-wheel competition. Out of a total of 57 starts in these
    divisions, he has collected 16 wins, 21 top-five finishes and seven pole positions. With
    only nine NASCAR Busch Grand National series starts, Nadeau was elevated to compete in
    five races in NASCAR's premier division, the Winston Cup series. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">FIRSTPLUS FINANCIAL is a specialized consumer finance company that,
    through its subsidiaries, originates, purchases, services and securitizes consumer finance
    receivables, primarily home improvement and debt consolidation loans, all secured by liens
    on the borrower's home. FIRSTPLUS, headquartered in Dallas, has regional offices in
    Denver, Colorado; Holly Springs, Mississippi; Columbus, Ohio; Columbia, South Carolina;
    Mission Viejo, California; Salt Lake City, Utah and a network of origination branches
    nationwide. <!-- TextEnd --> </font></p>

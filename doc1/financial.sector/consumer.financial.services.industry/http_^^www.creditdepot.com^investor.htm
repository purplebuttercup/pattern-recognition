<BR><BR><A NAME="secqtr"><H3></LEFT><CENTER>CREDIT DEPOT ANNOUNCES IMPROVED FISCAL 1997 SECOND QUARTER</CENTER><LEFT></H3></B><BR>
<I>January 30, 1997</I><BR>
<BR></CENTER>
<LEFT>(GAINESVILLE, GA) - (Business Wire) - <B>Credit Depot Corporation</B> today announced financial results for the fiscal 1997
second quarter and six months ended December 31, 1996.<BR><BR>
For the fiscal 1997 second quarter ended December 31, 1996, revenues increased sharply to $2,194,418 from $190,168 reported a year ago.  An operating profit (income before taxes) of $123,948 was recorded in the fiscal 1997 second quarter compared to an operating loss of $1,371,078 incurred in the same period a year ago.  Net income for the quarter was also $123,948, or $(0.00) per share after preferred stock dividends, compared to a net loss of $1,371,078, or $0.44 per share after preferred stock dividends, recorded in the similar period a year ago.  For the six months ended December 31, 1996, revenues increased sharply to $3,578,130 from $630,144 recorded in the fiscal 1996 first half.  The operating loss narrowed sharply to $150,245 in the fiscal 1997 first half from $2,284,934 in the like period a year ago.  The net loss in the fiscal 1997 first half also equaled $150,245 versus the year ago loss of $2,284,934.  After preferred stock dividends, the losses were equal to $0.12 and $0.71 in the 1997 and 1996 
periods respectively.<BR><BR>
Per share results in the 1997 and 1996 second quarter and first half are based on 3,660,861 and 3,378,761, and 3,519,811 and 3,378,761 weighted average shares outstanding in the respective periods.  The company made no provision for income taxes as a result of the financial effect of prior years tax loss carry-forwards.  The improvement in operating results in the fiscal 1997 second quarter and first half reflects principally an increase in loan originations of approximately 54% from the fiscal 1997 first quarter and 170% from the fiscal 1996 second quarter, as the company began to realize the benefits of its gains on sales of mortgage loans in the 1997 fiscal second quarter sharply increased to $2,018,000 from $4,000 in the comparable period a year ago due to the increased volume of loan sales and increased profit margins on these sales.<BR>
<BR><B>Gerald F. Sullivan Sr.</B>, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated: "We are pleased by our results for the fiscal 1997 second quarter and first half.  The results are a tangible measure of the continuing successful implementation of our operating plan.  "In the fiscal 1997 first half, we completed a $9 million convertible debt offering and agreed to provide $125 million of sub-prime first mortgage residential loans for inclusion in the securitizations of a large institution.  Both of these events have provided Credit Depot with additional liquidity and operating flexibility to capitalize on the growth opportunities in the sub-prime residential real estate market.</LEFT>

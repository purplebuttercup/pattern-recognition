<CENTER><B>It's your choice!</B></CENTER>
Your benefit program is an important part of your total compensation. The
Green Tree Flexible Benefits Plan is comprehensive, responding to both
your short- and long-term needs, and flexible, allowing you to tailor an
individualized program that best meets your needs.
<P>

<A HREF="#Top">Back to Top</A>
<UL>
<LI>Upon hire, you enroll in the Flexible Benefits Plan and elect different benefit programs and different levels of coverage. </LI>
<LI>During the annual open enrollment period, you have the opportunity to change your benefit elections or elect different levels of coverage.</LI> 
<LI> Each year Green Tree allocates benefit credits to you to spend on your flexible benefits. </LI>
<LI>Each flexible benefit option costs a specific number of benefit credits. The higher the level of coverage, the more credits it requires. Likewise, lower coverage levels require fewer benefit credits. </LI>
<LI>If the total cost of your benefit elections is more than the credits allocated, you pay the difference through payroll deductions each pay period. Any unused credits will be forfeited. </LI>
<LI>Unless otherwise instructed, payroll deductions are made on a pre-tax basis, with the exception of Long-Term Disability Insurance which is made on an after-tax basis.</LI>
<LI>The Flex Plan allows you to select the benefit elections and the levels of coverage that are right for you.</LI>

					<B><I>LOS ANGELES - October 13, 1997 -</I></B> Aames Financial Corporation (NYSE: AAM) today announced that
					Chairman Gary K. Judis and Director Joseph R. Cerrell will not
					seek re-election to the company's board of directors and will
					leave the board, effective November 19, when their directorship terms
					expire.<BR>
					<BR>
					Georges C. St. Laurent, Jr., 61, former chairman and chief executive
					officer of Western Bank, Oregon, a subsidiary of Washington Mutual,
					Inc.; and George W. Coombe, Jr., 72, a senior fellow at Stanford
					Law School and former general counsel for the Bank of America;
					have been nominated and their appointments are subject to election
					by shareholders at the company=s annual meeting to be held November
					19, 1997. A new chairman will be elected after the new board is
					finalized.<BR>
					<BR>
					&quot;After more than 30 years in the financial services business,
					I am looking forward to spending more time with my family and
					friends,&quot; said Mr. Judis. Chairman, former chief executive and
					president of Aames since 1982, Mr. Judis, 59, has been a key executive
					with Aames since it became a public company. Under his leadership,
					Aames pioneered the concept of sub-prime home-equity lending,
					as well as packaging those loans into pools for sale to institutional
					investors. He oversaw the growth of Aames, as it filled a neglected
					consumer need by providing loans to credit-impaired homeowners.<BR>
					<BR>
					&quot;Gary Judis has been a pioneer in our industry for more than three
					decades,&quot; said Neil B. Kornswiet, president. &quot;To a large extent
					Aames' leadership position today is directly related to Gary's
					valuable contribution. We will miss his leadership talents, but
					we wish him well.&quot;<BR>
					<BR>
					&quot;We are also grateful for the many years of service that Joseph
					Cerrell has given the company,&quot; continued Mr. Kornswiet. Mr. Cerrell,
					62, chairman of Cerrell Associates, Inc., a public affairs consulting
					firm, has been an original member of the Aames Board of Directors
					since January 1992.<BR>
					<BR>
					Mr. St. Laurent was chairman and chief executive officer of Western
					Bank, Oregon from 1988 to 1997. He is currently a principal in
					various real estate, agricultural and forestry related ventures
					and also serves as a director of Baxter International, Inc. and
					The Perkin Elmer Corp.<BR>
					<BR>
					Mr. Coombe is a senior fellow at the Stanford Law School teaching
					international commercial arbitration. From 1990 to 1995 he was
					a partner in the law firm of Graham &amp; James and from 1975 to 1990
					he was executive vice president and general counsel of Bank of
					America. From 1968 to 1975, Mr. Coombe served as assistant general
					counsel and corporate secretary of General Motors Corporation.<BR>
					<BR>
					&quot;We are honored and privileged to add two new directors to the
					Aames board with such extensive financial services backgrounds,&quot;
					said Cary H. Thompson, chief executive officer. &quot;Their years of
					experience will enable the company to continue to build upon its
					leadership position.&quot;<BR>
					<BR>
					Today's announcement coincides with the distribution of the company's
					proxy statement prior to the annual meeting to be held November
					19, 3 p.m., Hotel Inter-Continental, 251 S. Olive Street, Los
					Angeles. The proxy solicits votes for directors, a stock ownership
					plan and ratification of accountants.<BR>
					<BR>
					Aames Financial Corporation is a leading home equity lender and
					currently operates 59 Aames Home Loan offices in 23 states throughout
					the United States. Its wholly owned subsidiary, One Stop Mortgage,
					Inc. operates in 41 offices in 35 states.<BR>

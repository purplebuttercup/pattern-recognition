Typically, this term is used when the new equipment is financed using the same lease structure (i.e., Fair Market Value, $1.00 Purchase Option, Fixed Purchase Option, etc.) as was used in the underlying transaction except that the lease term for the add-on is set so that it expires coterminously with (on the same date as) the original transaction.

Similar to a purchase option, it is a provision in a lease giving the lessee the right to purchase the leased property for a price less than its anticipated fair market value. This term is most often used in connection with classifying a lease for accounting purposes.

			<p><font color="#660033"><b>

Capital Lease	</b></font><br>
A lease that meets at least one of the criteria outlined in paragraph 7 of FASB 13 and, therefore, must be treated essentially as a loan for book accounting purposes. The asset is carried on the lessee's balance sheet. The four criteria are:<p>

<li>lease term is greater than 75% of estimated economic life of the equipment <p>
<li>present value of lease payments is greater than 90% of the equipment's fair market value  -- A Capital Lease is treated by the lessee as both the borrowing of funds and the acquisition of an asset to be depreciated; thus the lease is recorded on the lessee's balance sheet as an asset and corresponding liability (lease payable). Periodic lessee expenses consist of interest on the debt and depreciation of the asset. 
</ul>

			<font color="#660033"><b>
Capped Fair Market Value</b></font><br>
A provision in the lease allowing the lessee to purchase the leased property for its fair market value, but not exceeding a certain amount. The advantage of the cap is that the lessee will know the maximum payment required to purchase the leased property.

			<p><font color="#660033"><b>
Conditional Sale (Time Sale)</b></font><br>

<li>Officers who operate the corporation on a day-to-day basis. They are removable at the will of the board of directors. The corporation's bylaws should be reviewed to determine how many officers the corporation has, what their titles are, and whether there are limitations on their powers. -- A corporation exists independently and apart from the people who own it. Its shareholders are liable only tot the extend of their investment in the corporation. The corporation is responsible for its own debts and therefore shields its shareholders from corporation debts and other obligations as long as the business is conducted in "good faith."

The provisions of FASB 13 derive from the view that a lease that transfers substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership should be accounted for as the acquisition of an asset and the incurrence of an obligation by the lessee (a capital lease) and as a sale or financing by the lessor. Other leases should be accounted for as the rental of property (operating leases).

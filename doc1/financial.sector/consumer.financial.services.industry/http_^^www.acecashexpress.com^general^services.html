<B> ACE provides its customers with a means to obtain cash immediately as well as other
services, including: </B>
 
<P>
 
<B>Check cashing.</B> ACE's primary business is cashing checks for a fee. The principal type of check the Company cashes is a payroll check.  The Company also cashes government assistance and tax refund checks and insurance checks or drafts. Although the Company has established guidelines for approving check cashing transactions, it has no preset limit on the size of the checks it will cash.
<P>
	<B>Money transfer services.</B> ACE is an agent for the transmission and receipt of wire transfers through the MoneyGram network. Through this network, ACE customers can transfer funds electronically to any of over 14,000 MoneyGram locations nationwide (including other ACE stores) and 19,000 locations worldwide. 
<P>
	<B>Small consumer loans.</B> Small loans are a relatively new product, but one with a proven track record and tremendous potential.  ACE has experienced substantial demand for this product from consumers with limited access to other sources of credit. The product offered by ACE varies by region and state where local regulatory agencies determine how the product is structured and presented. The average cash advance is $134 with a short-term signature loan that may involve the holding of a check for future deposit. ACE is a licensed provider of small consumer loans in Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, and Washington.  Loan fees and interest revenue from this product for fiscal 1997 amounted to $5.7 million, compared with $2.5 million in fiscal 1996.
<P>
	<B>Money order sales.</B> The Company sells (IPS) Money Orders in denominations up to $1,000.  These money orders are generally used by the Company's customers for bill payments, rent payments and other general disbursements. The fees charged for money orders depend on local market conditions and the size of the money order.
<P>
	<B>New Customer fees.</B> The Company charges a one-time fee for each new check cashing customer to cover the costs of the initial setup in the ACE customer database and identification verification.
<P>
	<B>Food stamp distribution.</B> The Company is a distribution agent for food stamps in four of its market areas (Albany, Atlanta, Savannah, and Seattle).
<P>
	<B>Lottery and lotto ticket sales.</B> The Company's owned stores sell lottery and lotto tickets in most of the jurisdictions in its markets that operate lottery and/or lotto games (Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Texas, Virginia and Washington, D.C.).
<P>
	<B>Other services and products.</B>  In addition to the above, in some owned stores ACE offers a variety of other retail financial products and services to its customers, including telephone and utility bill payment services, public transportation passes, copying and fax transmission services and postage stamps, pagers, prepaid long distance telephone cards and local phone service.

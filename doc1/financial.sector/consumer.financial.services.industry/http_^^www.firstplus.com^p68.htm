    <b><p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Arial">FIRSTPLUS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. and Deutsche
    Morgan Grenfell Inc. Announce Committed Financing Facility</font></p>
    </b><p><font face="Arial">FIRSTPLUS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. (Nasdaq: FPFG) today announced
    that it has executed a $1.6 billion committed warehouse and residual financing facility
    with German American Capital Corporation, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank North America
    Holding Corp. (&quot;Deutsche Bank North America&quot;). FIRSTPLUS will use the facility
    to fund its second lien installment loans and the residual interests it generates from its
    related securitization activities. Pricing for borrowings under the new committed
    warehouse facility is Libor plus 0.5%, a 50 basis point improvement from FIRSTPLUS&#146;
    most favorably priced current warehouse facility. The residual financing portion of the
    facility features a similarly preferential financing rate. This facility is part of an
    overall plan to reduce all FIRSTPLUS&#146; funding costs and further strengthen its
    balance sheet through committed facilities.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Dan Phillips, FIRSTPLUS&#146; CEO, said, &quot;This new line of
    credit gives FIRSTPLUS access to an attractive funding rate on a committed basis. The
    lower financing costs should translate into stronger 1998 cash earnings, as the net spread
    on loans residing on our balance sheet increases substantively as a result of this
    transaction. Equally as important, the commitment and its associated relationship with
    Deutsche Bank North America and its affiliate, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Inc.
    (&quot;DMG&quot;), produces a stronger FIRSTPLUS balance sheet. The relationship with
    Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Inc. should significantly enhance FIRSTPLUS&#146; capability to
    access the global capital markets for its securitization and other capital raising
    activities.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Kevin Ingram, Managing Director of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Inc.,
    added, &quot;DMG is very pleased to begin this relationship with FIRSTPLUS, a company we
    view as a market leader among financial services companies. We view this as the beginning
    of a long-term relationship which DMG hopes to expand over the years ahead. Initially, DMG
    will assist FIRSTPLUS with the expanded funding, securitization and securities
    underwriting services that we offer in the domestic capital markets. In addition, through
    DMG&#146;s global funding and securities underwriting platform, we also hope to assist
    FIRSTPLUS to expand its opportunities and business in Europe.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

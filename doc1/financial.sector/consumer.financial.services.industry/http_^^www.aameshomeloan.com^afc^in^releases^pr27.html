					<B><I>Los Angeles, California - October 29, 1997 -</I></B> Aames Financial Corporation (NYSE: AAM) today reported record
					loan production in its core retail and One Stop Mortgage operating
					units. In addition, Aames' loan servicing unit generated record
					revenues during the fiscal quarter.<BR>
					<BR>
					Revenue for the quarter was $77.9 million, up from $75.6 million
					from last year's first fiscal quarter. Net income for the quarter
					was $13.1 million, compared to a net loss of $4.6 for the same
					period a year ago. Excluding nonrecurring charges net of taxes
					of $18.6 million in the prior year's first quarter, net income
					amounted to $14.0 million. On a fully diluted per share basis,
					net income per share for the quarter totaled $0.40, compared with
					$0.46 (excluding nonrecurring charges and adjusted for the three-for-two
					stock split in the form of a stock dividend effected in February
					1997), in the prior-year period.<BR>
					<BR>
					Neil B. Kornswiet, Aames president, said, &quot;We are continuing to
					set new records in our core loan production units. Total loan
					production for the quarter increased 4.4 percent to $523 million,
					compared to $501 million for the comparable quarter last year,
					despite an expected reduction in correspondent volume. Aames'
					retail originations for the quarter were $133 million, compared
					to $101 million for the same quarter last year, an increase of
					32 percent, and origination volume for the One Stop broker network
					reached $262 million, compared to $141 million in 1996, an increase
					of 86 percent.&quot;<BR>
					<BR>
					Kornswiet added, &quot;We are pleased to note that approximately 80
					percent of our loan production volume is now being generated by
					our core retail and One Stop broker operating units. Continued
					geographic expansion in the retail and broker channels is expected
					to enhance growth opportunities for the Company.&quot;<BR>
					<BR>
					Kornswiet said that as expected, the previously announced pricing
					changes made in the last fiscal year resulted in no large bulk
					purchases in the correspondent unit this quarter. Notwithstanding
					these changes, loan production for correspondent was $128 million
					for the quarter, compared to $259 million for the comparable quarter
					in 1996.<BR>
					<BR>
					Cary H. Thompson, Aames' chief executive officer, said, &quot;We view
					the loan servicing unit as a significant component of our core
					business due to its positive cash flow contribution and its stable
					revenue stream. The Company recorded record loan service revenues
					of $9.8 million in the quarter, an increase of 109 percent from
					the $4.7 million in the comparable quarter in 1996. We are continuing
					to focus our efforts on increasing the loan servicing portfolio
					and achieving increasing economies of scale.&quot;<BR>
					<BR>
					Thompson added, &quot;At September 30, 1997, Aames' loan servicing
					portfolio increased to $3.4 billion, up 89 percent from $1.8 billion
					for the same period last year. Consistent with the Company's strategic
					plan, the Company's in-house serviced portfolio increased by both
					the transfer of loans which had been subserviced by a third party,
					and the servicing of the majority of new production during the
					period. Future plans call for the in-house transfer of substantially
					all of the Company's servicing portfolio by the end of fiscal
					1998.&quot;<BR>
					<BR>
					The carryover of loans held for sale at September 30, 1997 increased
					43 percent to $204 million from $143 million at September 30,
					1996. The Company securitized $504 million during the quarter
					ended September 30, 1997. The decline from the $243 million carryover
					at fiscal year end 1997 resulted from whole loan sales which totaled
					$39 million during the quarter ended September 30, 1997.<BR>
					<BR>
					The Company also announced that its board of directors has declared
					a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.033 per share, payable
					on November 21, 1997, to stockholders of record as of November
					10, 1997.<BR>
					<BR>
					Aames Financial Corporation is a leading home equity lender, and
					at September 30, 1997, operated 60 retail offices serving 26 states,
					including the District of Columbia. Its wholly-owned subsidiary,
					One Stop Mortgage, Inc., operates 40 branches serving 35 states,
					including the District of Columbia, at that date.<BR>

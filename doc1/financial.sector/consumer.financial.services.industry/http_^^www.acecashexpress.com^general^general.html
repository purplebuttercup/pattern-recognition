These measurements demonstrate management's ability to increase revenue, profitability and cash flow while maintaining a solid financial position.<P><HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#000000"><CENTER><FONT COLOR="336633">"ACE CASH EXPRESS MAY BE ON VERGEOF UNCHECKED GROWTH, SAY BULLS"<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE="2">THE WALL STREET JOURNAL - HEARD IN TEXAS ISSUE: AUGUST 13, 1997</FONT></CENTER><HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#000000"><P><B>REVENUES</B><BR>	ACE has experienced exceptional revenue growth over the past five years.  The three and five year annual compounded revenue growth rates are 30% and 27%, respectively.  The growth can be attributed to the opening of de novo units, acquired units, same stores sales increases, and new products.<P><B>EARNINGS</B><BR>	Earnings per share (EPS) increased 40% in fiscal 1997 over fiscal 1996. Driving the increase in EPS are increases in average revenue per store, new product offerings, and increased center level contribution. The three and five year EPS compounded annual growth rates are 27% and 17%, respectively.<P><HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#000000"><CENTER><FONT COLOR="336633">"AMERICA'S FASTEST GROWING COMPANIES"<P>"WHERE BANKS FEAR TO TREAD"</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="2">THE INDIVIDUAL INVESTORISSUE: SEPTEMBER 1997</FONT></CENTER><HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#000000"><P><B>EBITDA</B><BR>	Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) have grown dramatically over the past five years, at a 36% compounded annual growth rate, and over the past three years, at a 42% compounded annual growth rate. Management is focused on growing the network of stores while maximizing cash flow from operations.<P><B>LOAN FEES AND INTEREST</B><BR>	ACE's fastest growing product line is small consumer loans, generating fees and interest.  Introduced in December 1994, the loan product is now available in 189 stores, up from 141 stores at June 30, 1996.  Loan fees and interest revenue increased 132% in fiscal 1997 from fiscal 1996.<P><HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#000000"><CENTER><FONT COLOR="336633">"CHANGING THE IMAGE OF THE CHECK CASHING STORE"<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE="2">INVESTOR'S BUSINESS DAILY ISSUE:  APRIL 7, 1997</FONT></CENTER><HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#000000"><P><B>NUMBER OF STORES</B><BR>	ACE's store growth continued in fiscal 1997 with 45 new (de novo) stores and 46 acquired stores. ACE continues to evaluate its entire store network, and in the normal course of business, closed 18 of its stores during fiscal 1997.  ACE expects to open 60 new (de novo) stores in fiscal 1998.<P><B>STORE CONTRIBUTION</B><BR>	Store contribution as a percentage of revenue increased 8% in fiscal 1997 from fiscal 1996. Fiscal 1997 was a record year, with store contribution at 32.1% of revenue.  <P><B>REGION AND HEADQUARTERS</B><BR>	During fiscal 1997, ACE made an investment in both headquarters and region expenses.  Driving the increase was spending on technology, office space and personnel.  ACE devoted more full-time supervisors to store management, which we believe has helped increase average revenue per store.  <!-- Commented out for now --><!-- <P><HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#000000"><CENTER><FONT COLOR="336633">"OUR INVENTORY NEVER GOES OUT OF STYLE AND IT NEVER SPOILS"<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE="2">THE WALL STREET CORPORATE REPORTERISSUE:  AUGUST 4TH - 10TH, 1997</FONT></CENTER><HR SIZE="2" NOSHADE COLOR="#000000"> --><P><B>CHECKS CASHED</B><BR>	Our core business of check cashing continues to perform well.

<H3>OUR WORLD FAMOUS CABLE CARS</H3>

Every visitor wants to ride San Francisco’s <I>moving landmarks</I>, our world famous CABLE CARS. And they are an exciting trip… up and down some of the city’s steepest hills at a steady 9.5 mph. Andrew Hallidie, a Scottish wire cable manufacture, introduced the system over 120 years ago in an attempt to improve on the City’s method of horse-drawn transportation. When the world’s first Cable Car traveled down Nob Hill in the summer of 1873, the invention was an immediate hit. Not only was this new system safer, but it opened up many new areas for home building previously though unsuitable due to their steep hillside locations.<BR><P>

Prior to 1906, the system had 600 cars rolling over its 110 miles of track. The Great Quake, however, caused extensive damage and many cable car lines were never rebuilt. Currently, there are 39 cars operating over a 10-mile network:<BR>

<LI> The <B>POWELL-MASON Line </B>begins at Powell & Market, runs over Nob Hill to Bay Street at Fisherman’s Wharf.
<LI>The <B>CALIFORNIA Line</B> runs from the foot of California street at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, in the Financial District, right past <B>The Pacific Bank </B> headquarters at 351 California Street,  through Chinatown, over Nob Hill to Van Ness Avenue.

A complete renovation in 1982 has the system running better than ever. To take a ride, purchase tickets at self-service machines - except at Powell and Market, where you purchase them from the police kiosk - or pay the conductor on board. Cars operate daily from 6:30am until 12:30am. $2.00 one way fare; or use a MUNI passport.<BR><P>

Visit the Cable Car Museum at 1201 Mason Street for a behind-the-scenes look at the system. A gift shop is also located on the premises.

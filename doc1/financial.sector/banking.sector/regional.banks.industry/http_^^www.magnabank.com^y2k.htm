<p align="center"><font size="5">Year 2000 Compliance Position</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">Magna has committed what it
believes are significant resources to meeting its goal<br>
of achieving full year 2000 compliance by December 31, 1998. A
dedicated internal<br>
task force, supplemented with outside consulting resources, has
worked to evaluate<br>
the scope of the situation and developed a comprehensive action
plan. The task<br>
force has completed a number of portions of its plan. Areas being
addressed<br>
include: in-house developed programs, PC and client services
applications, hardware<br>
upgrades, mainframe operating system and banking applications,
third-party vendor<br>
assessments, and compliance testing.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">Magna envisions compliance of its
systems to be in line with the following Federal<br>
Reserve definition:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4"><em>Software and hardware systems
are defined as compliant if they can demonstrate<br>
correct management and manipulation of data involving dates,
including single-<br>
century and multi-century formulas, without causing an abnormally
ended scenario<br>
within the system of data exchanges via applications interfaces,
as well as data<br>
spanning the period before, during, and after the turn of the
century.</em></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">Should you have any specific
questions about our Year 2000 activities, please contact<br>
your Magna Relationship Officer.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">We look forward to serving you in
this century and the next.</font></p>

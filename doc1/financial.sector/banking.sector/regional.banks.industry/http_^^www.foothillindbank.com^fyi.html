<P>
In three short years when the ball drops at Times Square and calls an 
end to the year 1999, those two nines will be replaced by two zeros, 
creating for most businesses and corporations, a critical problem.  Our 
customers, and potential customers, are our primary reason for being and 
for that reason, we feel it's important to bring to your attention an 
issue that can affect ninety percent of all known computers.

<P>
<B>THE ISSUE</B><BR>
The issue is simple. Since the invention of computers, programmers have 
conserved space in data fields by abbreviating as much as is reasonably 
possible.  A standard abbreviation is to use the last two digits to 
designate a year. Thus the year 1997 in your computer's records is the 
year "97."  The computer then keeps track of years mathematically, the 
next large number indicating the following year, and a smaller number 
indicating an earlier year.  Unless corrected, when the year following 
"99" is coded by "00," an error message will occur.  Almost every 
transaction that is entered into your company's computer has a date 
associated with it. 

<P>
There are literally hundreds of potential trouble spots in all companies.

<P>
<B>HOW CAN IT INVOLVE YOUR BANK</B><BR>
It is anticipated that at least 90 percent of most banks will have 
serious computer problems associated with the calendar rollover from 1999 
to 2000.  Examples of problems that can occur in banks (and other 
institutions): investment accounting systems will not be able to accrue 
interest on investments, or to calculate how much interest is due.  
Personnel benefits records will not compute.  Pension plans are going to 
lose track of who is vested and who is not. File retention systems are 
going to quit retaining files in chronological order.  Entire accounting 
systems may fail.

<P>
If other banks have not begun a risk assessment as Foothill Independent 
has, they may not have enough time to properly identify the software and 
hardware equipment that needs to be corrected.  Testing and "back up" 
contingencies are also issues for the year 2000.  It has been proposed 
that it will take the remaining three years to ensure that the "switch" 
in the year 2000 is a non-event.

<P>
<B>HOW IT CAN AFFECT YOU, OUR CUSTOMER</B><BR>
Corporate and business customers can expect the same problems.  Besides 
financial formulas and personnel information, customers can anticipate 
inventory and maintenance records failing, and billing procedures 
corrupted. Software programs designed specifically for time management 
programs and security systems may abort.  

<P>
<B>THE SOLUTION BEGINS NOW</B><BR>
Foothill Independent Bank has begun preparation for the year 2000.  If 
you are not a customer of Foothill, we suggest that you contact your 
institution and ask if contingency plans are in place.  As a company, we 
strongly suggest you begin preparing too. Take the following steps to 
ensure your company's computer systems are problem free for the Millenium.
<UL>
<LI>Begin with a risk assessment.
<LI>Identify the systems that must be modified.
<LI>Develop a plan to get the systems modified.
<LI>Test systems and execute "back up" measures.
<LI>Pursue external vendors with vigor.
</UL>

<P>
As a Foothill customer, you can learn more about how to implement these 
steps.  Please leave your name in our <A HREF="guestbook.html">Guestbook</A>

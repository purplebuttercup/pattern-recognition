Home Loans

</p>

<p> 
What's more important than where and how you live? Is there any investment more 
important than the home you buy? Yet, is any purchase more emotionally charged? We are here. To offer innovative thinking and a consultative, "custom-fit" approach 
to 
financing your home, whether it's your first or your 10th home purchase, a primary 
residence, second home or investment property, a new mortgage or a refinance.
</p>

<p>
We can offer you more attractive choices than you may have thought possible. And 
with 
laptop access to information and resources, a Wachovia Mortgage Loan Consultant 
can 
take your application on-line (often from the comfort of your home or office) and 
can 
often give you a firm commitment on the spot.
</p>

<p>
By expediting the approval process, we can speed up your closing and put you in a 
better negotiating position with your seller. We can also show you how you can 
save 
money by choosing the right mortgage program for your individual situation. Your 
Mortgage Loan Consultant can help you decide which approach is best for you, 
drawing 
from our more than 25 loan programs. 
</p>

<p>
Talk to us. You'll find us wherever you are in the Carolinas and Georgia--and in 
some 
parts of Virginia and Florida--or contact us by <a href="contact.html">
phone</a> or <a href="../../personal/mortgage/loan.html">e-mail</a> and we'll help you get 
started.

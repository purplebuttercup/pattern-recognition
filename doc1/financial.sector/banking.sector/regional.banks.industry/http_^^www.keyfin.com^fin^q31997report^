<H2><CENTER>Third Quarter Report 1997</CENTER></H2>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>

<br>
<HR="#0000ff">

<H4>
We are pleased with our third quarter financial performance. As we continue
to face numerous competitive market challenges, we are confident that our
strategies to build market position by providing our customers with solutions
for their financial needs will enable us to maintain the growth momentum
of the past several years.</H4>

<H4>
 <BR>
Net income in the third quarter was $24.6 million, or $0.48 per share,
compared with $22.3 million or $0.43 per share in the same 1996 period.
Excluding the impact of the special charges and portfolio restructuring
losses taken during the second quarter of 1997, net income for the nine
months was $70.9 million or $1.37 per share, versus $66.7 million or $1.28
per share in 1996. We remain focused on two vital measures of performance
and are constantly at work to improve our returns on both equity and assets.
ROE for the quarter reached 14.64% while ROA was 1.43%. The competitive
marketplace is challenging us to achieve our goal of being in the top quartile
in these measures among banks in our peer group.</H4>

<H4>
 <BR>
Maintaining net interest income strength is critical to the success of
our organization and as a way of building this capability, we continue
to roll out new financial products at the same time we are strengthening
relationships on a customer-by-customer basis. Our newest product is KeyBuy,
a package of services that includes advising customers on new vehicle purchases,
financing the vehicle, and providing tips on how to get the best price
for their old car. Well suited to our emphasis on relationship banking,
KeyBuy helps customers do the research necessary to decide what buy is
best for them. Maximizing convenience, customers can access this program
through our Internet site.</H4>

<H4>
 <BR>
KeyBuy replaces the indirect automobile lending program, which we exited
this quarter, enabling us to serve customers directly and to create opportunities
to extend relationships through additional financial services. We believe
KeyBuy is a better way for us to serve the important automotive market.
Auto dealers remain important customers to us and we will continue to provide
financing for their inventories and offer additional services to them.</H4>

<H4>
 <BR>
Increases in fee income are being fueled by growing market recognition
of our programs and continuing investment in fee-based financial services.
During the third quarter, we acquired MMC&amp;P, a retirement benefit services
firm in Pittsburgh. This acquisition will increase our capabilities in
defined contribution recordkeeping and specialized retirement plan management,
enabling customers in Keystone's markets to attain outstanding service
levels for all of their employee benefit programs. The firm's president,
John Parks, assumes responsibility for Keystone's employee benefit trust
operations as we continue to grow our many resources in meeting the complete
financial needs of our customers.</H4>

<H4>
 <BR>
Indeed, investment market confidence in our asset management group is shown
in our steady rise of assets under management. Bill Martindale, chief investment
officer of our Martindale Andres investment management subsidiary, was
recently recognized in Money Magazine as one of the top portfolio managers
in the country. Martindale Andres &amp; Co. manages the KeyPremier family
of mutual funds, which was introduced earlier this year and has been accepted
well in the market. At present, the KeyPremier family consists of seven
separate mutual funds with assets expected to reach one billion by year-end.</H4>

<H4>
 <BR>
In addition to sharing information with you on our earnings growth and
other progress within the company, I would also like to announce the promotion
of Mark L. Pulaski to Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer. He was
also appointed as a member of the board of directors. In his new posts,
Mark will be responsible for all customer sales and support and related
administrative segments of the company. Mark previously served as Sr. Executive
Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer, and Chief Financial Officer.</H4>

<H4>
 <BR>
Concurrently, George H. Groves, Sr. Executive Vice President and Chief
Banking Officer, has resigned to pursue other business interests. George
has made many valuable contributions to the company over the past 12 years,
and we wish him well in his future endeavors.</H4>

<H4>
 <BR>
While we have experienced substantial growth over the last decade, we believe
our potential is still ahead of us. Our ability to build effective relationships
with customers and our investments in more products and services are distinguishing
Keystone as the financial institution of choice in our markets. We thank
you for your continued support as we continue to build shareholder value.</H4>

Keystone recorded earnings growth as third quarter net income reached $24,600,000
or $0.48 per share, compared to $22,287,000 or $0.43 per share for the
same period last year. Earnings per share growth was 11.6% from the third
quarter of 1996 to the same period in 1997.
<BR>
<br>
Net income for the nine-month period declined to $62,353,000 or $1.21 per
share, from $66,717,000 or $1.28 per share in 1996. Excluding the impact
of the special charges and portfolio restructuring losses taken during
the second quarter of 1997, net income for the nine months was $1.37, up
from $1.28 for the same period in 1996, resulting in a return on average
assets of 1.44% and a return on average equity of 14.44%.
<BR>
<br>
Operating performance for Keystone continued to reflect underlying strength
and was influenced by both stable net interest margin and growth in noninterest
revenues, including security gains. Net interest income grew over 10% since
the third quarter of 1996, including loan growth of over 11% and a net
interest margin of 4.62%. Noninterest revenues grew over 16%, reflecting
increases in nearly all revenue categories. </H4>

<H4>
During the third quarter, Keystone was able to complete the conversions
of Financial Trust Corporation and First Financial Corporation of Western
Maryland to Keystone's various systems and applications. This effort will
position Keystone's new partners and their customers to take full advantage
of the complete array of financial products and services available through
Keystone.
<BR>
<br>
The additional time and effort to convert and consolidate operating systems
of merger partners resulted in increased salary expenses during the period.
However, this effort is expected to improve the operating efficiency in
the fourth quarter and beyond. Despite the effect of the expenses associated
with the conversions and consolidations, Keystone's ratio of noninterest
expenses to revenues remained constant at 58.51%, and further improvement
is expected.
<BR><br>
Asset quality ratios continue to reflect underlying strength, despite national
trends of higher consumer delinquency levels. Key measures included ratios
of nonperforming assets to loans of 0.59% and total risk elements to loans
of 1.10%, both of which are stable compared to historical results.</H4>

ECONOMIC COMMENTARY</H2>

<TABLE CELLPADDING=10 >

<TD ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=TOP COLSTART="1"><IMG SRC="earnpershare.gif" ></TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP COLSTART="2">
<H4>
Stagflation is a term we have not heard in quite some time. Recall that
it is a term which was coined in the 1970s to describe the phenomenon of
stagnate economic growth with high unemployment and accelerating inflation.
Perhaps we should lament the decline in "wordsmithing" as the best phrase
we have been able to conjure up for the opposite of "stagflation" is a
"Goldilocks economy." The point is that the "New Paradigm" of high growth
with low unemployment and near price stability we have been hearing so
much about isn't new at all. It is simply the converse of the stagflation
of the 1970s. After the experience of the '70s, we already knew that the
contemporaneous, or near term correlation between employment/growth and
inflation, the Phillips Curve, was weak at best.
<BR>
<br>
Rather, it appears that we are seeing the results of some tough decisions
made in the late '80s regarding the restructuring of the private as well
as the public sector. And for those of us old enough to remember hiding
under our school desks during air raid drills, the collapse of the Soviet
Union and the subsequent decline in our defense spending should not be
overlooked as a major contributor to declining inflation.
<BR>
<br>
But what about the future of inflation? For answers to that question we
must look back to the early part of this decade. Five years ago, on September
30, 1992, the yield on the 90-day T-bill was 2.74%; the 5-year T-note,
5.32%; and the 30-year T-bond, 7.38%. At quarter end '97, the yields were
5.09%, 5.99%, and 6.40%, respectively. Five years ago the yield curve,
the plot of interest rates from overnight to 30 years, had not been so
steep for nearly a half century in relative terms. The yield on an intermediate
maturity was double that of a short-term T-bill, and a long-term Bond returned
nearly half as much as an intermediate Note. This was the midpoint in an
approximately 2-year period of extraordinary liquidity creation for the
financial system by the Federal Reserve. The steepness of the yield curve
is a key indicator of the level of liquidity in an economy, as well as
inflation expectations to some degree. The Federal Reserve made it possible
for some large financial intermediaries to borrow short and invest long
at extraordinarily wide spreads in order to rebuild their balance sheets
that were severely damaged in the late '80s and early '90s.</H4>

<TD ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=TOP COLSTART="1"><IMG SRC="nonperformallow.gif" ></TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP COLSTART="2">
<H4>
The Federal Reserve withdrew some of that liquidity in 1994, causing one
of the sharpest declines in fixed income securities prices in many years.
But much of the liquidity has remained in the financial system. The system
itself has created enormous additional liquidity on its own through increased
valuations of equity securities, the rebound in real estate prices, and
increased lending by financial intermediaries. In the third quarter, for
example, an important indicator of economic growth, Commercial and Industrial
Loans, increased at nearly a 10% pace. This indicates very strong growth
for the third quarter and likely the fourth quarter as well.
<BR>
<br>
Economic weakness in the economies of our major trading partners, Europe
and Japan, has kept a lid on pricing power domestically. The memory of
massive corporate downsizing has kept worker demand in check until recently.
However, Europe appears to be rebounding to the point that the German Central
Bank saw fit to raise key interest rates to slow credit expansion. The
UPS strike settlement could be viewed as a turning point in labor compensation.
Ironically, the once vaunted Japanese economy still struggles.
<br>
<br>
 Close inspection may reveal that the people who suggested that the Japanese economic model
was to be emulated by all are the same people who are saying inflation
is dead. The flat yield curve relative to 1992, with a relatively passive
Federal Reserve, seems to indicate a high degree of investor confidence
that inflation will not be an issue well into the future. A "New Paradigm"
or just another chapter in economic history?</H4>

<h4>
<h3>Buying a car can be a tedious and often confusing process.</h3> <h4>On September
2, 1997, Keystone Financial, Inc. introduced KeyBuySM, a customized research
and auto loan service designed to take the worry and frustration out of
buying a new car. The first direct auto loan service of its kind to be
offered by banks in the Keystone market area, KeyBuy allows customers to
research the car they want to buy, apply for an auto loan, and get assistance
with their trade-in vehicle, all on-line at www.keyfin.com. Or, customers
may call a KeyBuy Associate toll-free at 1-888-4-KEYBUY.
<BR>
<br>
KeyBuy handles those things that buyers don't have the time or desire to
do themselves. KeyBuy helps the customer find the right car through a series
of simple, intuitive questions. For example, a customer can demand that
a car have a sunroof (thereby ranking cars with sunroofs higher than those
without). The guide generates a personally ranked list of cars. The customer
can then obtain a detailed, side-by-side comparison of the cars on the
list.
<BR>
<br>
After finding the right car, a customer can calculate payments and fill
out a loan application on-line. Once approved, KeyBuy financing includes
a sight draft (which works like a check) that the customer can take to
a dealer. This permits buyers to negotiate with the power of cash and purchase
the vehicle of their choice, right on the spot.
<BR>
<br>
This new direct auto loan service package further reinforces Keystone's
commitment to Relationship Banking.

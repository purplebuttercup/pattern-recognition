<STRONG>
<P>Keystone Financial Inc. (KFI) is a Bank and Financial Services Holding
Company headquartered in Harrisburg, PA.</P>

<P>Keystone Financial Inc. practices a super community banking
philosophy.  We deliver personalized services to our customers 
through our local community banks. </P>
<IMG BORDER=2 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="kfihq.jpg">
<P>In addition to traditional services provided by our community 
banks, Keystone also operates several nonbanking companies which
deliver an array of services to our customers:   brokerage, 
investment, mortgage banking, leasing, life / accident and health insurance.</P>

<P>Our investment and banking subsidiaries service 31 counties 
in central, eastern and southern Pennsylvania and 3 counties in 
Maryland and West Virginia.  And our mortgage services are also
available in Virginia and Delaware.</P>

<P>KFI was formed in 1984 as a result of the merger of Mid-State Bank
of Altoona, PA and Northern Central Bank of Williamsport, PA.
In 1988 Pennsylvania National Bank of Pottsville, PA was included.</P>

<P>Since then KFI has brought several other banks into the family: 
Keystone Bank (formerly Frankford Bank), American Trust Bank N.A. and 
other smaller banks, which have been incorporated into our larger ones.</P>

<B>The Solution To The Last Chapter</B><BR>
<P>
John Stevens the reporter is John Stephano, high school classmate of Zach Brandt and Nora Norman.  John and Zach had frequently been engaged in friendly competition all through high school with Zach always one-upping John.  John and Nora were high school sweethearts until senior prom night when Zach and Nora were chosen King and Queen.  Who could blame Nora for falling head over heals for Zach.  Zach Brandt and John Stephano were virtual look-alikes, but Zach had that extra something that always seemed to leave John playing second fiddle when they went head-to-head.<BR>
<P>
John Stephano/Stevens could not forgive Zach for stealing his girlfriend.  When Zach and Nora announced their engagement, John decided to seek his revenge.  John knew that there was a tremendous amount of pressure being placed on Hollywood's perfect couple, and was betting on a scandal to rip them apart.  Nora Norman's fans would be outraged if Zach showed any signs of indiscretion, and Zach's ailing career could not withstand any bad publicity.  What could be more perfect then a public display of infidelity - photos and all - to drive a wedge between Zach and Nora.<BR>

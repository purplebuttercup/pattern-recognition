<H2><B>MYSTERY CLUE #5</B></H2>
Nearly hidden deep within Derek Fisher's personnel file was a faint pencil notation, initialed "RC," that Derek had been useful as a primary witness for the company in a lawsuit eighteen months ago. Bank reviewed the <I>Legal News</I> for more information. The case had been filed by a former employee, who claimed he was wrongly fired on a trumped-up misconduct charge. The judge found no concrete evidence of misconduct, and issued a warning to the company. The claimant won the lawsuit.<BR>

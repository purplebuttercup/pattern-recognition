Welcome to The Vault, an interactive spot for you to win prizes and valuable coupons from The Columbia Bank.

<p>
It's easy, all you have to do is answer three little questions and the The Vault will be unlocked.

<p>
<FONT COLOR="#DD0055"><B>What will you find inside?</B></FONT><br>
You never know, could be a prize or a coupon for bank products and services....you just never know!!  You'll have to visit often to get them all!

<p>
<FONT COLOR="#DD0055"><B>How do I play?</B></FONT><br>
Just click on your answers from the choices given and if all three match, the combination is secured and The Vault will swing open.  Anything that's inside is yours for the taking!  You must then print out the page and take the coupon to any branch location to redeem.  If all 3 tumblers drop, the door opens.  If one of the tumblers is still locked, try again (everyone's a winner!)

<H5><A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/"><IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=bottom SRC=gif/netscape.gif></A> We recommend using the latest version of Netscape Navigator&#153; for optimal viewing of this web site, and to take advantage of <A HREF="#secure">secure interactivity</A> with our site.  If you are not using Netscape Navigator&#153;, please follow these download instructions to obtain the latest version of it:</H5>

<OL>
<LI>Go to <a href="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/">1-2-3: DOWNLOAD NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR</A>. 
<LI>Follow Netscape's prompts which will ask you:
<OL>
<LI>What operating system you use (i.e. Windows, Mac, etc.)

<LI>If you select Netscape Navigator&#153; for Windows&#153;, follow these instructions:
<UL>
<LI>Read the license agreement and the readme.txt file.
<LI>Download either the 16-bit or 32-bit .exe (executable) file (e.g. <B>n1612b4.exe</B>) and save it to a temporary directory, such as C:\TEMP\.
<LI>In <B>File Manager</B>, double click on the .exe file which will then self-extract.
<LI>Once extracted, choose <B>Window</B>, <B>Refresh</B>, then double-click on on the file <B>setup.exe</B>.  This will automatically set up Netscape in it's own directory on your hard drive.

Bank West rubbed his bleary eyes once more as the button on his phone flashed insistently. "Yeah, yeah, yeah," he muttered. He took a quick swig from his coffee mug, then shuddered at the bitter dregs of yesterday's pot.<BR>
<P>
"Yeah, hello," Bank croaked into the phone.<BR>
<P>
<IMG align=left width=144 height=91 src="phone.gif">
"Is this the Bank West Detective Agency?" came the hesitant voice.<BR>
<P>
Bank cleared his throat. "Uhn--yeah. This is Bank West."<BR>
<P>
"Mr. West, my name is Henry Schmidt. I am calling at the request of my employer, Roby Cates, who owns the Cates Creative Company. Perhaps you've heard of us?" questioned Henry thinly.<BR>
<P>
"Yes, I've heard of you. You do advertising work for some of the biggest companies  in  town."<BR>
<P>
"That is correct. And we often work with persons referred to us by the May Agency. In fact, Amanda May herself recommended that we put ourselves into contact with you."<BR>
<P>
This guy worked at an ad agency? Maybe he was the accountant. "What can I do for you?" Bank asked, wishing Henry would get to the point.<BR>
<P>
"Ms. Cates would like to set up an appointment for you to meet with us at our offices, if you could . . . perhaps sometime this afternoon?"<BR>
<P>
Bank <A HREF = "chksave.htm">checked</A> his calendar. "How does one o'clock sound?"<BR>
<P>
"Fine, just fine," Henry bubbled nervously. "We'll see you here at one, then. I truly appreciate your squeezing us in, Mr. West. Thank you."<BR>
<P>
"No problem," Bank mumbled and hung up. Whew! He rummaged his desk for the plastic-wrapped danish he'd been saving for an emergency, then glanced at the legal pad in front of him. He had doodled a mythical Henry Schmidt, complete with black horn-rim glasses, suspenders and a bow tie.<BR>
<P>
Bank chuckled. Well, he would learn the scoop on Henry soon enough.<BR>
<P>
<CENTER>*    *     *     *     *</CENTER><BR>
<P>
No suspenders or bow tie, thankfully. And the glasses had stylish wire frames, not horn-rims -- although Henry's plaid pants were a bit <A HREF = "cds.htm">seedy</A>.<BR>
<P>
"I'm so pleased to meet you, Mr. West," Henry said. "Please, if you'll step this way, Ms. Cates is waiting for us in her office."<BR>
<P>
"Mr. West!" Roby Cates smiled generously and waved Bank into a nearby seat. "Glad you could come. I see you've met Henry, our art director."<BR>
<P>
Bank nodded. Art director? He'd had Henry pegged as a numbers man, for sure. "I'd like to get down to business right away, if you don't mind."<BR>
<P>
"Of course," Roby Cates answered smoothly. "Henry, please excuse us. I think it would be best if I explain the situation to Mr. West myself."<BR>
<P>
Henry bit his lip. "Certainly, Ms. Cates." He withdrew, closing the door behind him.<BR>
<P>
"Now then," Roby sighed, with a glimmer of a frown. "That Henry -- he's quite a character. This is an ad agency, after all..." Roby paused. "We have a delicate balance of creative and artistic minds here -- Henry seems to have trouble... adapting into the mix." She shrugged. "But he's harmless enough, I suppose -- or at least, I hope."<BR>
<P>
<IMG align=right width=119 height=72 src="pen.gif">
"What do you mean, Ms. Cates?" Bank clicked his pen impatiently. <BR>
<P>
"Well, it's not a catastrophe, but I <I>am</I> having quite a morale problem. You wouldn't believe how much <A HREF = "comserv.htm">production</A> has suffered -- oh, but I'm getting ahead of myself. You don't even know what I'm  talking about."<BR>
<P>
Bank clicked his pen again. "Go on."<BR>
<P>
"It's our music. We subscribe to an automated satellite music service and pipe it throughout the office. The channel is always set to contemporary hits, which our workers prefer. But lately, quite often the channel is mysteriously changed. To Muzar. You know -- elevator music."<BR>
<P>
Bank shuddered, as if again tasting those bitter coffee dregs. "But why don't you just reset the channel? It sounds like a practical joke."<BR>
<P>
"Perhaps it seems so. But it's become much more than a nuisance. It nearly amounts to sabotage. We actually missed a deadline because a copywriter <I>fell asleep</I> at his desk. We need to determine who is behind this, so we can take the appropriate action." Roby shook her head. "And as for resetting the channel -- the receiver is kept in our equipment vault, which remains locked at all times."<BR>
<P>
"Who has the key?" Bank asked.<BR>
<P>
<IMG align=left width=144 height=97 src="vault.gif">
"The vault is the responsibility of the art director -- Henry Schmidt." <BR>
<P>
Bank scratched his chin. "Henry have any beefs?"<BR>
<P>
Roby shrugged again. "Maybe. Co-workers pull pranks on him. Hide his coffee cup, glue his pens down. That sort of thing. He never really seems comfortable with them. He just does his job, and that's it. But all I know is, each time the channel has been changed, Henry's gone. Once he was on a week's vacation. I heard it got pretty hairy around here."<BR>
<P>
"Heard?"<BR>
<P>
"Well, yes," Roby lifted a brow. "I was out of town myself that week, courting a new account. I'm out most of the time, actually. Since I bought the company back, I've been working nearly 24 hours a day."<BR>
<P>
"Bought it back? But hasn't this always been your company?"<BR>
<P>
"Yes and no," Roby explained. "It was, but a few years ago I was convinced to sell to a huge conglomerate. The money was fabulous, and I had more free time. But I didn't like it. I had very little say in what went on in my own company. So I scraped, and I managed to buy my company back." She grinned with pride.  "Now I'm in control again. This baby is all mine, now."<BR>
<P>
Bank stood. "I need to see the vault."<BR>
<P>
"Of course. Right this way." Roby rose and ushered him through the bustling <A HREF = "loan.htm">building</A>.<BR>
<P>
Young workers in jeans and T-shirts scurried about with artboards and stacks of paper. The air had a pleasant energy; conversation and laughter mingled with the upbeat music, making it seem more like a social club than a business.<BR>
<P>
A man brushed by and winked at Roby. She gave him a soft smile and a subtle "thumbs-up" sign.<BR>
<P>
"Who was that?" Bank asked.<BR>
<P>
"Oh, Derek Fisher. We go way back," Roby answered casually. She stopped. "Ah, here we are. Henry, please open the equipment vault."<BR>
<P>
<IMG align=left width=136 height=110 src="keys.gif">
"Certainly." Henry glanced uneasily at Roby as he pulled a tangle of keys from his pocket and turned several locks on the nearby steel door.<BR>
<P>
"As you can see, Mr. West, we store all our items of value here; including photo equipment and backup computer components."<BR>
<P>
Bank patrolled the room. There were no other ways to get in. No large air ducts, no access panels. He located the innocuous brown music receiver. "Can the box be operated by remote control?"<BR>
<P>
"No."<BR>
<P>
"Hmmm," Bank mumbled. "Henry, what if you're not here and someone needs equipment?"<BR>
<P>
"Well, there is an advance sign-out sheet. So usually, I've already taken care of them. On occasion, in the <A HREF = "about.htm">past</A>, I have left my keys with my assistant to supervise a sign-out."  Henry cleared his throat.<BR>
<P>
"And who is your assistant?"<BR>
<P>
"Derek Fisher."<BR>
<P>
"I see. But what if you're not here, and Derek doesn't have the keys?"<BR>
<P>
"Well, then, Ms. Cates has the master set. Didn't she tell you?" He cast Roby a confused glance. Roby's smile remained fixed.<BR>
<P>
Bank headed for the door. "Thank you, Henry.  Ms. Cates, I'll be needing some papers from you, and then I'll be on my way."<BR>
<P>
"Anything you'd like, Mr. West. Anything at all."<BR>
<P>
Behind them, Henry Schmidt's hands trembled as he re-locked the vault.<BR>

Yields go up and down, but with the <B>PENALTY-FREE CD</B>, your yield can only go up! The <B>PENALTY-FREE CD</B> lets you lock in today's high yields, while letting you increase your rate if it rises with the One Up Option.** Plus there's no penalty for early withdrawal, and it's FDIC insured.

<P>
Stop by any of our 13 branches or simply call our <B>Express Service at 1-888-TCB BANK</B>.

<FONT SIZE=4>Bank compared the equipment sign-out sheet to Henry's attendance records. There were no sign-outs on the days Henry had been gone or the evenings before he had left. Bank also compared photocopies of Roby's appointment calendar to Henry's records. Their days away matched. Derek Fisher's timeslips showed he had punched in early nearly every time Henry had been absent.</FONT><BR>

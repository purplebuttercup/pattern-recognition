BankAmerica's views on financial services subjects are presented in a 
variety of venues around the world.  In this space, we'll put up a few 
sets of remarks on important issues that we believe may be of interest 
to the public.

"To sustain our current employment levels in a mature economy with 3 
percent GDP growth, the U.S. must sell to those emerging markets that 
are enjoying growth levels two and three times faster than ours... And 
as hard as it may be to accept in the most powerful economy in the 
world, to do this in an increasingly competitive world we must 
continue to adapt faster, we must compete smarter, and we must act 
more boldly and with a broader vision.<BR>
Make no mistake: The world is watching . . . but it is not waiting."<P>

"Last year, when I spoke to shareholders at the annual meeting for the
first time, I identified an overall goal I had set for the 
company. I said then that we wanted to make BankAmerica the
best place to bank, the best place to work, and the best place 
to continue to invest.... There is one more thing that I think can
help us to be the best: you."<p>

"We all have a decision to make about the common good.  
We can be bound by close horizons, or we can behave like leaders.  
We can demand of our representatives a sense of urgency in addressing 
the crisis in Social Security.  We can demand of our representatives a 
solution that is broad-minded, thorough, and fair.  We can demand a 
return to values like personal accountability and responsibility.  And 
we can demand that demagoguery will not be tolerated."<P>

"You and I in this room may grasp the benefits of a global economy and free 
trade.  The fact is that across this country, a good many people, some 
thoughtful and some not so thoughtful, simply think we're wrong.  They think 
that trade should be limited, American jobs protected, and domestic industries 
insulated... The challenge is to convince ourselves and our colleagues to look 
beyond a short-term "win-lose" view, to see the real long-term advantages and 
benefits of free and open global trade."<P>

"As individuals, we must move from an entitlement ethic to a savings ethic, or 
what former Commerce Secretary Pete Peterson recently called a "self-endowment 
national ethic."  At present, however, we are acting like a nation in denial.  
We personify the definition of insanity – which is, doing the same things over 
and over and expecting different results.  Instead, we must become a nation of 
savers once again, living within our means and endowing our nation's future by 
creating the seed capital for investment."<P>

          "Our goals, in essense, are very simple.  We want BankAmerica to be 
     the best place to bank, the best place to work, and the best place to 
     continue to invest.  To me, that means keeping our focus on providing 
     customers the services they want, when, where, and how they want them. 
      It means recruiting the most talented people in the buisness, 
     motivating them to do their best work, recognizing their efforts, and 
     rewarding them appropriately.  Above all, it means running the bank 
     for you, the shareholders, weighing all of our decisions according to 
     the impact they will have on long-term shareholder value, investing 
     only in those businesses which we believe can give us an appropriate 
     long-term return for the risk involved, and showing you with our 
     results that BankAmerica Corporation is a place in which you want to 
     continue to invest."<P>

"I believe that the financial services industry is on the verge of a new era of 
growth and strength for four basic reasons: first, industry leaders are building 
strong new franchises that expand the scope and breadth of their business; 
second, the pace of technological change is accelerating and, while often 
challenging, has many positive implications for our daily activities; third, the 
increasing globalization of world capital markets gives us new opportunities to 
act as financial intermediaries; and fourth, it appears to BankAmerica that the 
California economy is rebounding, which gives all of us a near-term favorable 
environment in which to do business."<P>

"Genuine and sustained community development cannot be achieved by one company, 
or even by one industry.  To be successful, it will require partnerships and 
alliances that transcend individual agendas.  It will require market-based 
models of community development that are motivated by solid business strategies, 
including long-term profitability.  And it will take a good-faith, genuine 
commitment on the part of everyone here today, and our counterparts throughout 
the country."<P>

"I've been a banker here in San Diego for 20 years.  During that time, I've seen 
the industry change a great deal.  I've seen bankers' hours replaced by 24-hour 
service.  I've seen government deregulation herald an era of unparalleled 
convenience and unyielding competition.  I've also seen our city lose a number 
of its major financial institutions in the industry's nationwide trend toward 
consolidation.  But today, more than ever, I believe that where a company is 
headquartered matters less than what it contributes to the community.  By that 
measure, I think we are very much a local company.  The bank is proud of its 
partnership with San Diego, and we look forward to working with everyone here to 
make this city -- our city -- an even better place to live and work. "<P>

<H3>THE BANKAMERICA FOUNDATION COMMUNITY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE</H3>
</CENTER>

<P>

In 1993, BankAmerica Foundation launched the Community Economic Development
Initiative, which provides grants to nonprofit, community-based groups that
support economic development and job creation in low-income communities.<p>
The <B>BankAmerica Community Economic Development Initiative (CEDI)</B>
supports BankAmerica Foundation's strategy to provide philanthropic resources
that support the long-term business activities and policies of BankAmerica
Corporation, and the growth of the markets it serves. 
<p>
By directing resources to small nonprofit groups with a demonstrated capacity
to generate jobs in low-income communities, BankAmerica hopes to promote
sustainable development in critical, emerging markets.<p>
In 1993, BankAmerica disbursed $500,200 to six groups in California that are
doing pioneering work in the area of grass-roots economic development. In 1994,
an additional $500,000 was awarded to community organizations in western states
other than California. This year, BankAmerica Foundation commissioned a study
by Oakland-based Walker &amp; Associates to measure the ongoing success of the
six California groups that received funding in 1993. Based on the findings of
that study, BankAmerica Foundation will again extend grants to those California
organizations so they can continue to enhance their economic development
programs.
<p>
Profiles of these programs, which are drawn largely from the research work of
Walker &amp; Associates, are presented here as models for community-based
economic development.

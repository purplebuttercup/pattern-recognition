For a select group of individuals--business owners and their families,
active investors, and top corporate executives--the traditional

Their finances are connected at many levels, and their financial
decisions demand increasingly sophisticated solutions. These are the
needs that Bank of America's Private Bank was established exclusively to
serve. As part of one of the nation's leading corporate banks, our
Private Bankers can manage the close relationship between your business
and personal finances. We have decades of experience serving
individuals, families, and family businesses, so we understand the risks
and opportunities you face. And we have the experience and resources to
develop customized solutions for your personal financing, investment,
and long-term asset management requirements, as well as your retirement
and estate-planning concerns. We also provide a complete range of
services for privately held businesses. <P> <A

BankAmerica's environmental commitment extends throughout 
 the corporation, from recycling programs to credit 
decisions. Our goals include improving our efforts 
by learning from other organizations and by sharing 
the successes and challenges of our environmental initiatives. 



The Bank's programs and record are described 



in our <A HREF="1994_pr_overview.html">1994</A>, <A HREF="1995_pr_overview.html">1995</A>, and <A
HREF="env_progress_rep.html">1996 Environmental Program Progress Reports</A>.

We believe that effective 



land use requires a mix of intelligently planned expansion 



on the urban fringe and making better use of existing 



urban areas. <A HREF="env_p8.html">Beyond Sprawl</A>, a report co-authored 
by BankAmerica, raises the issue of how California 



should accommodate future growth. To this end, BankAmerica 



supports the <A HREF="http://www.ceres.ca.gov/CRA/NCCP/index.html">Natural Communities Conservation Planning 



Process</A> and <A HREF="env_p7.html">Conservation Banking</A>. Also discussed are innovative efforts 



to renew contaminated inner city land through <A HREF="env_p9.html">Brownfields 



Redevelopment</A>.<P>

Throughout the environment section, we offer links to World Wide Web pages of organizations with which 
we have worked or which offer valuable information on subjects we cover.  Those 
organizations have interesting and innovative programs, and we invite you to explore their web sites as well as ours.

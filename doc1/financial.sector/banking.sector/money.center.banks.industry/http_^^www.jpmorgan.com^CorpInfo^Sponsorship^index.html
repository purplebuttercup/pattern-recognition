J.P. Morgan, as a global enterprise, sponsors cultural events the world
over. A dance performance in Johannesburg, the restoration of an historic
church organ in Brussels, a chamber music recital in Santiago, an exhibition
of paintings in Chicago . . . these opportunities enable us to enrich the
fabric of life and our relationships in the communities where we, our neighbors,
and our clients live and work. At Morgan, we look for opportunities to celebrate
new perspectives as well as timeless traditions - echoing our commitment
to innovation and our heritage of service in global finance.</P>

<P>This portion of our website highlights the firm's diverse sponsorship
activities and seeks to share our delight in the creativity, beauty, and
energy of the arts - and artists - we support.</TD></TR>

This exhibition will open September 25, 1997 through January 12, 1998 at
the national Renaissance museum at the Chateau d'Ecouen, 19 km north of
Paris.</P>

<P>These 16th century ceramics, of which fewer than 80 objects are known
today, are among the rarest Renaissance artifacts. At the end of the 19th
century they were prized by wealthy collectors, among them Pierpont Morgan.
This will be the first time that the &quot;Morgan&quot; pieces have been
on view in France since their purchase at the turn of the century.</P>

<P>This exhibition is sponsored by the J.P. Morgan Paris office and the
R&eacute;union des mus&eacute;es nationaux (RMN).</TD></TR>

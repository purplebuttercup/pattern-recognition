<BR>
Build Your Own Bank puts you in the driver's seat.  You tell us who you are and what you're interested in, and we give you the information most likely to be important to you.  Sign in and you're on your way to Your Own Bank.  It's easy.  It's optional.  You only need to tell us about yourself once.  And you can update your personal information at any time.
If you're <A HREF="/sbin/admusrinfo?form_name=usrregi&usrreg_type=new&URL=/byob/thanks.html">ready to start</A>, click here.<P>

Before exploring other parts of our site,  you'll receive information that's most likely to interest you, such as:
<UL>

<P>
<LI>Daily announcements about new information on our site in those areas that are most important to you.  And, just like the Money Tips, we'll collect announcements for you and save them until your next visit.

Want to apply for a loan online?  Open a checking account?  Sign up for HomeBanking?  
We'll automatically transfer information you've entered in your profile to any forms or applications on 
this site so you don't have to type it in again.  (But only if you've Built Your Own Bank.)

<font FACE="ARIAL","HELVETICA" COLOR="#ff0000"><B>Getting started is easy!</B></FONT>
<BR>
Click on the Start Here button at the bottom of this page and complete the brief Personal Profile to Build Your Own Bank.  All information in your Personal Profile will stay with us and be kept confidential. You can update your profile whenever the mood strikes.  Simply select Update Your Personal Profile from Your Own Bank page.
<P>
To see Your Own Bank page for the first time, don't forget to sign in after you fill out the profile.  Consider it practice for the future.  It's that easy!
<P>
You might want to write down your user name and password for future reference.  Keep in mind:
<UL>
<li>People often use the same user name and password for many sites to keep things simple.

<li>Only use numbers and letters in your user name and password and please don't use spaces.

<li>Your user name and password is different than the Passcode you'll use to access your accounts through HomeBanking or BankAmericard&174; from our web site.
</UL><P>

<font FACE="ARIAL","HELVETICA" COLOR="#ff0000"><B>How do you get to Your Own Bank?</B></FONT>
<BR>
On your first visit, click on Sign In after you fill out your Personal Profile.
<P>
On subsequent visits:
<ul>
<li>Click on the BYOB button from our Home Page or at the bottom of any page and the <I>Take Me to My Own Bank</I> button on the page that follows.
</ul><P>
Remember to visit Your Own Bank page each time you return to the Bank of America web site.  Over time we'll be adding even more customizable features.  
<P>
And don't forget, if you're a HomeBanking or BankAmericard customer, you can go directly to your personal accounts from Your Own Bank page as well.

In order to provide our customers with the optimal experience, 
we have designed the Citibank site using frames technology. This 
means that it will be easier for you to navigate through the site and 
download time will be considerably reduced. 
<br><br>
Consequently, you can only view this site if you are using a 
browser that supports frames. <b>If you are seeing 
this page, your browser does NOT support frames.</b>
You will have to upgrade your browser to move further into Citibank's website.
<br><br>
Browsers that may be used include <a 
href="http://www.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/index.html">Netscape 
Navigator 3.0</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie">Microsoft Internet 
Explorer 3.0</a>. If you are using <a href="http://www.aol.com/try/">America 
Online</a>, please be sure that you've upgraded to version 3.0.

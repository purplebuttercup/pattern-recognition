<H4><A NAME=global>Global Leadership</A></H4>
Bankers Trust began managing money on behalf of clients in the 1930s and has since become one of the world’s leading asset management firms.  We have done so by offering a wide range of investment strategies that span the risk/return spectrum, providing full-service solutions that meet diverse client needs through our three major funds management locations in New York, Sydney and Tokyo, as well as our worldwide global network.  The confidence our clients have placed in us is reflected by our rankings:  we are the fourth largest investment manager in the U.S.; the largest manager of mutual funds and the second largest of institutional funds in Australia; and the leading foreign-owned trust bank in Japan.
<H4><A NAME=service>Full Service Solutions</A></H4>
The breadth of our capabilities and our global network of professionals differentiate us from most other investment managers.  Our core competencies range from quantitative investment disciplines, where we manage a broad array of indexed and enhanced strategies, to niche, high value-added active and alternative investment strategies which seek to generate superior risk-adjusted returns.  For many of our clients, this depth of capabilities enables us to implement both their strategic and tactical asset allocation programs.
<P>Our strategies are available through separately managed accounts and a broad range of commingled funds, mutual funds, unit investment trust vehicles and offshore funds.  We serve a wide variety of institutions, individuals and high-net worth investors, managing their tax-exempt and taxable assets.
<P>Our portfolio management teams are small groups of talented specialists who focus on specific market niches.
<P>Integral to the management of all of our investment strategies is our unrivaled commitment to risk management.  A risk management team operating independently from our portfolio management teams works to measure and monitor the risks in each portfolio.

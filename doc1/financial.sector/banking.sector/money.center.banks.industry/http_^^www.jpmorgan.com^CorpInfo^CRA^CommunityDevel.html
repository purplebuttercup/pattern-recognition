<p>J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated makes charitable contributions to a wide range of organizations in the arts, education, the environment, health and human services, international affairs, and urban affairs, through both the J.P. Morgan Charitable Trust, which is funded by Morgan, and the firm's offices and subsidiaries around the world. In 1996 contributions totaled nearly $16 million, including $4 million that matched gifts made by more than 6,000 Morgan employees, retirees, directors, and spouses.</p>
	<p>The Community Relations and Public Affairs department is responsible for relationships with nonprofit organizations and governmental agencies working in education, health, the arts, civic and urban affairs, the environment, and international activities. It supports recognized and competent groups with financial grants, donated equipment, volunteer services, technical advice, and other services. The department also supports Morgan's efforts to comply with the <A HREF="./CRAstmt/ST96hp.html">Community Reinvestment Act</A>. Additionally, it manages grant programs from foundations for which Morgan serves as trustee, as well as the Volunteer Center, the Matching Gifts program, and summer community internships.</p>

<p>In fulfilling the firm's responsibility to promote community development, J.P. Morgan takes the same approach it uses in other markets and with other clients. As is the case with all of the firm's endeavors, the first thing we look to do is establish a relationship. And from that relationship we build a partnership.</p> 

<p>We approach community development with a philosophy that economic, social, and cultural challenges are best met with long-term commitments rather than temporary quick-fixes. Toward that end, we work with individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and government institutions, using our financial expertise and resources to enhance their ability to bring about lasting change.</p>

<p>Loans and investments are made through the J.P. Morgan Community Development Corporation (MCDC). Established in 1971 as the first bank holding company subsidiary of its kind, MCDC continues to be a leader among wholesale financial institutions in devising innovative financing to assist in the development of inner-city communities.  It focuses on four broad areas: affordable housing, nonprofit organizations, minority enterprises, and economic development projects.</p>

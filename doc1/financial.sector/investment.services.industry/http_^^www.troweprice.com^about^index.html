<P>

Founded in 1937 by Thomas Rowe Price Jr., the Baltimore-based
investment management firm is one of the nation's leading
providers of no-load mutual funds, both for individual
investors and for corporate retirement programs. T. Rowe
Price and its affiliates manage approximately $125 billion for more than six million
individual and institutional accounts.<P>

In the six decades since its founding, T. Rowe Price has
remained focused on investment management. Today, the firm
and its affiliates serve as investment adviser to more than
70 stock, bond and money market funds.  T. Rowe Price strives
to achieve superior investment performance for its investors,
but is always mindful of the risks incurred versus the
potential reward. <i>BusinessWeek</i> last year noted that
T. Rowe Price is "One of the industry's strongest and best
run fund companies."<SUP>1</SUP><P> 

T. Rowe Price's joint venture with Robert Fleming Holdings
Ltd., a century-old London-based merchant bank, currently
manages more than $33 billion, including $18.8 billion in
no-load international funds, making
<A HREF="/interspot/rpfi.html">Rowe Price-Fleming</A> the
largest international no-load manager.<SUP>2</SUP>  Rowe
Price-Fleming has access to more than 100 analysts worldwide,
carrying on the firm's tradition of rigorous, independent
research.<P>

The firm also operates a discount brokerage service that lets
investors buy and sell individual stocks, bonds, precious
metals and other securities. <P>

The overriding strength of T. Rowe Price remains its people.
Our 45 portfolio managers, who have an average of 10+ years
tenure at the company, work closely with more than 50
analysts to uncover solid investment opportunities. In
addition, more than 400 highly-trained service representatives
are available seven days a week through our toll-free number

<i>Merrill Lynch OnLine</i> permits you to view account data for your primary Merrill Lynch central asset account (e.g., your CMA account) and any other accounts that are linked to such primary account for account statement mailing purposes.  By accepting and using <i>Merrill Lynch OnLine</i>, you represent on a continuing basis that you are authorized to have viewing access to any account for which you and other linked account parties have requested linking of account statements.  Merrill Lynch will provide you with a User ID and password when you enroll to ensure the security of your account data and that of any other linked account parties, which you agree to safeguard.  Merrill Lynch shall not be responsible for any breach of security caused by your failure to maintain the confidentiality of your User ID and password.  All account data is provided as a convenience and for your information, but it is not the official record of your account activity with Merrill Lynch; your Merrill Lynch account statement remains such official record.  Account data provided through <i>Merrill Lynch OnLine</i> is generally updated as of the prior business day's close of business, but is subject to adjustment and correction; therefore, it should not be relied upon for taking any action without first confirming its accuracy and completeness with your Financial Consultant or Client Service Representative (for EAA accounts only).  Merrill Lynch will not be responsible for any loss or damage that could result from your taking any such action if you do not first contact your Financial Consultant or Client Service Representative (for EAA accounts only) to confirm the accuracy and completeness of your account data.<p>

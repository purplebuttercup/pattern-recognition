<H2>Awad &amp; Associates</H2>
</CENTER>
<img src="images/ainvpl.gif" hspace=5 align=left> <FONT  SIZE=+2>A</FONT>wad & Associates was established in 1992 as joint venture between James D. Awad and Raymond James & Associates, Inc. We are an investment advisor, registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, currently managing more than $725 million for clients. Our clients include individuals, corporations, trusts, endowments, municipalities and unions. As a division of Raymond James & Associates, we have the financial security of a much larger firm. Yet there are just nine professionals in our New York office, which gives our clients the intimacy of a small firm. This is an unusual characteristic that we believe is beneficial for clients. <p>

Regardless of the type of client, Awad & Associates has three overriding objectives:
	<ul><li>Protect our client’s capital
	<LI>Generate capital appreciation substantially in excess of inflation and reduced-risk returns
	<LI>Provide returns in excess of all applicable stock and bond indices</ul>
<p>
We employ a growth-at-a-value-price approach. While small cap stocks generally involve greater risks, we believe this approach will produce higher risk adjusted returns over time. We invest in companies that demonstrate strong earnings growth, strong cash flow from operations, good or improving balance sheets, and strong management ownership. 
<p>
These companies must also have stocks that exhibit low price-to-book, low price-to-earnings and low price-to-strategic acquisition value. 
<p>
Finally, if a company meets these criteria, we visit with management not only at company headquarters but at their operating facilities as well. Only after a favorable visit, will we invest in the company. 
<p>
Because we seek companies that are not widely followed by Wall Street analysts, we place notable emphasis on the quality of management. We invest a significant amount of time and effort to achieve a high level of comfort with management before making an investment. 
<p>
The portfolio management team is led by Jim Awad, chairman and chief investment officer of Awad & Associates. Jim has been in the investment business since 1965 focusing on research and portfolio management. Prior to forming Awad & Associates, he was president of BMI Capital, a successful money management firm he founded. Jim has also managed assets at Neuberger & Berman, Channing Management and First Investors Corporation.  He holds a BS Cum Laude from Washington & Lee University and an MBA from Harvard Business School.
<p>
Jim is assisted by Dennison (Dan) Veru, president of Awad & Associates. Dan, a member of the firm’s Investment Advisory Committee, is principally responsible for all research activities. He joined Awad & Associates in November 1992. Previously, he was senior vice president of Whiffletree Capital Management, a subsidiary of Smith Barney Harris Upham which specializes in small and medium capitalization stocks. From 1988 to 1990, he was vice president of Broad Street Investment Management. Prior to that, he was an assistant vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert. Dan has a BA from Franklin and Marshall College.

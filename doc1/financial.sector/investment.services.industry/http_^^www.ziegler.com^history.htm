<P>B.C. Ziegler and Company is a firm that has a dedication to client services
unmatched in the financial services industry. B.C. Ziegler and Company,
has been serving and responding to its client's needs since 1902. <BR>
<BR>
Founded in West Bend, Wisconsin by B.C. &quot;Ben&quot; Ziegler, today,
Ziegler is an investment banking and brokerage firm. A recognized leader
in investment banking for churches and the healthcare and long-term care
industries, it is the largest subsidiary of The Ziegler Companies, Inc.
<BR>
<BR>
Founded as an insurance agency, the firm soon added other financial services.
In 1913 it underwrote its first bond issue-for a West Bend church. By the
1960s Ziegler was noted for its leadership in healthcare financing; in the
1970s Ziegler expanded and introduced a tax-exempt financing division. <BR>
<BR>
The fast-paced 1980s and 1990s have brought a great broadening of services
and products. Today, a network of Ziegler brokerage offices serves investors
nationwide. <BR>

As an investment banker, Ziegler has developed new methods of financing
that continue its preeminence in the healthcare and long-term care fields.
Having underwritten bond issues totaling more than $20 billion, Ziegler's
record of safety and investor service is a special point of pride.<BR>

It is the intent of the management of Ziegler to continue to grow this business

<H1>About The Company</H1>
<IMG SRC="hr.gif"></CENTER>
<P>M. H. Meyerson &amp; Co., Inc., a securities firm originally
founded in 1960, conducts its business in four separate
divisions.  These are Wholesale Trading, Correspondent
Services, Retail Services, and Investment Banking. These four
divisions are functionally supported by the Compliance Department
and the Back Office Department (operations).</P>
<P>As of March 31, 1996, the Company had 160 employees, 108 of
which were registered representatives, including 25 registered
principals, licensed by the National Association of Securities
Dealers ("NASD") and various state securities commissions.  The
balance of the Company's employees, which number 52, are support
staff.</P>
<P>The Company's largest division (in revenue contribution) is
wholesale market making, which means engaging in principal
transactions on behalf of its proprietary trading accounts in
what are usually dealer to dealer transactions. The Company
employs 18 securities traders and 24 assistant traders who, with
management supervision, conduct the Company's high volume trading
operations.  The Company's traders are compensated by receiving a
fixed percentage of the profits from trading after deduction of
general expenses.  The traders are party to employment contracts
which provide for individual liability for any funds owed the
Company relating to losses, if any, incurred from trading
activities.  Pursuant to these employment contracts, the
individual traders are restricted to Company imposed limits as to
the extent of the trading positions they are permitted by the
Company to maintain. Traders are also required by the Company to
maintain a reserve, the size of which is a factor by which the
trading position limit is determined.  This reserve is also
available to offset trading losses, if any, suffered by the
individual trader in his trading account.  The Company endeavors
to observe high standards of commercial honor and just and
equitable principles of trade in conducting its business.</P>
<P>In its market making function, the Company carries long or
short trading positions in various securities.  The Company
currently trades over one hundred million shares of common stock,
preferred stocks and warrants per month. The Company's clearing
agent for market making and trading activities is Spear, Leeds
&amp; Kellogg, Inc., members of the New York and other principle
stock exchanges, of New York City, New York.  The Company has
contracted with an information services provider to supply
trading information regarding securities in which the Company has
an investment interest.  The Company obtains daily printouts that
inform the traders regarding financial and market information on
a current basis.  As of March 1996, the Company was a market
maker in approximately 2,500 securities.</P>
<P>The Company's trading activities have substantially increased
with the addition of several automated trading systems such as
Instinet, ACT, Selectnet, BNET,  and the automated ticketless
Brass trading program.  The Brass system, which, in effect, makes
trading "paperless", enhances the ability of the traders to focus
on market conditions by eliminating the prior administrative
burden incumbent in trading. The Selectnet and Instinet networks
link the Company with trading partners throughout the United
States, including other brokerage firms, block trading desks and
specialists on the regional exchanges.  These systems provide the
Company with access into every major securities exchange on a
worldwide basis.  The Company also employs the Autex electronic
volume monitoring system.  Through Autex, the Company can
determine the percentage of the Company's relative trading volume
in a specific security.</P>
<P>The Company's Correspondent Services division provides
competitive execution services primarily to retail securities
firms who utilize the Company to fill buy or sell orders in
over-the-counter and listed securities for their respective
retail customers.  The Company's Correspondent Service
facilitates large retail firms, including discount brokers and
banks, in obtaining instant execution of their respective
customers' orders.</P>
<P>The Company's Retail Sales division consists of 54 registered
representatives, including 9 registered principals, who
collectively maintain the majority of the Company's retail
securities accounts.  The Company's retail customer accounts are
carried on a "fully disclosed" basis by Bear, Stearns Securities
Corp.,members of the New York and other principle stock
exchanges,  pursuant to a clearing agreement.  This agreement
provides that customer securities positions and credit balances
are insured up to $50,000,000 by Securities Investors Protection
Corp. ("SIPC") and supplementary private insurance coverage.  All

customer credit balances are subject to immediate withdrawal from
Bear, Stearns Securities Corp., at the discretion of the
customer.</P>
<P>The Company's Investment Banking division consists of four
professionals.  The primary function of this department is to
conceptualize, plan and execute capital formation for small,
growing companies which have the potential, in the Company's
judgement, to become successful public companies.  The Department
is engaged in the structuring, management and participation in
public offerings and private placements of primarily equity
securities.  It also advises its clients in connection with
mergers, acquisitions and divestitures.</P>
<P>The Company also serves as the managing underwriter or
co-underwriter in initial public offerings and private placements
of primarily equity securities.  Since 1990, the Company has been
the managing or co-managing underwriter of 15 initial public
offerings and four private placements which raised in excess of
$125,000,000.  The Company generally underwrites small
capitalization growth companies in their relatively fast growth
stage.  These companies are generally in information
technologies, such as software, medical products and
pharmaceuticals.  The Company has also been a syndicate or
selling group member in approximately 96 underwritings.</P>

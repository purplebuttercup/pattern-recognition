<P>
The word unique tends to lose its meaning when every firm on Wall Street
uses it to
describe itself. So, we would suggest, that you look closely - very closely
- at how
each firm supports that claim in terms of its history, culture and vision.
We think
you'll find that DLJ is a different and very special place.
</P>
<P>
DLJ was the first firm on Wall Street to understand the significance of
research.
In fact, we created what is today known as institutional research, using
knowledge as
the basis for adding value in the investment process. This has since become
the approach
adopted by the entire industry; at DLJ, it is fundamental to <U>all</U> we do.
</P>
<P>
We are a firm that recognizes a few simple truths:
</P>
<P>
<UL Type="disc">
<LI>Be disciplined during the good times and bold during the bad. We
believe that
organizations are likely to make the biggest mistakes when things are going
well and
just as likely to overlook opportunities when the forecast is gloomy.
</P>
<P>
<LI>We can't be all things to all people. In fact, we don't want to be.
Instead,
DLJ makes sure that it's the leader in sectors it pursues. We have the
largest merchant
banking fund in the industry. We're the leader with an almost 30% market
share in high
yield. Our leadership is recognized in research and equities as well. Where
we've made
a commitment to be present, we've become a leader.
</P>
<P>
<LI>Have fun. DLJ may be the only firm on Wall Street that included "having
fun" as a <A HREF="http://www.dlj.com/annrep12_index.htm">corporate objective</A>. We're sure it has a lot to do with why people seldom leave DLJ.
</OL>
<BR>
At DLJ, we believe that the individual makes a difference. It has been
demonstrated here again
and again. Yes, you will work hard. But you will also have the opportunity
to go as far as you
can with our full support.
<P>
Because we have an unwavering commitment to these core values, we have
become a firm that itself
makes a difference. DLJ has both momentum and a leading position in so many
markets that we can
move into the future with tremendous confidence. For a career that is
infinitely rewarding, we
invite you to consider DLJ.

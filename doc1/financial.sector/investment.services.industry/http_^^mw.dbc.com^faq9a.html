<hr width=210 align=left>

<p>

<dl><a name="system"><dt><b>What are the system requirements for use of 
CBS MarketWatch RT?</b></dt>

<dd>The only suggestion we have about what is required for CBS MarketWatch RT is a 
browser that supports tables and cookies. There are two browsers that we suggest 
you use, <a href="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/upgrades/index.html">Netscape 
version 2.x or higher</a> or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/ie.htm">Microsoft's Internet Explorer</a>.</dd>

<p>

<dt><a name="AOL"><b>What if I have an older browser version?</a></b></dt><dd>You can 
still use CBS MarketWatch RT, but all the features that make CBS MarketWatch RT unique may not 
be functional.</dd>

<p>

<dt><a name="compuserve"><b>What are cookies and why is it so important my browser 
support them?</a></b></dt>

<dd>Cookies enable you to save your portfolio.  Since you can manage 6 portfolios 
using CBS MarketWatch RT, we thought it'd be neat if you could save  your portfolios and 
price them throughout the day. If cookies aren't supported, you will need to 
re-enter your portfolio's symbols for each update. <p><b>NOTE:

<font size=4 color="#000080"><b><a name="cache">Clearing your Cache</a></b></font>

<hr width=220 align=left>

<p>

<dl><dt><b>What is a cache and how does it work?</b></dt>

<br>

<dd>A cache temporarily stores the information on a page to your computer's disk 
drive. The first time you ask for a page, your browser retrieves the page from the 
internet.  If you request a page you have seen before, your browser checks to see 
if the page is available in a cache. For example, if you use the Back button to 
display a page, a cache can display the page more quickly than the internet can 
retransmit it.</dd>

<p>

<dt><b>Why do I need to clear my cache?</b></dt>

<br>

<dd>Sometimes a cache works improperly by providing stale pages. To avoid improper 
caching, you should  clear your cache regularly.</dd>

<p>

<dt><b>How do I clear my cache?</b></dt>

<br>

<dd>For most browsers, you can go into your 'preferences' and find the <b>Clear 
Memory Cache Now</b> and <b>Clear Disk Cache Now</b> buttons.  You may want to set 
your <b>memory cache</b> to hold whatever your system routinely has unused and set 
your <b>disk cache</b> to  2-5 megabytes.  You will also want to set your browser 
to 'Verify Documents' <b>every session</b>.  This will cause your browser to go to 
our server for the page you want to bring up.</dd></dl>

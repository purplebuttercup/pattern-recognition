The Raymond James Trust Services Group consists of the Raymond James Trust Company headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida, and the Sound Trust Company headquartered in Tacoma, Washington.  Both trust companies are organized and exist under the local banking laws of their respective states.  Both companies are audited by banking examiners on a regular basis as well as independent auditors engaged by their boards of directors.  Assets are held separately from those of the parent corporation.

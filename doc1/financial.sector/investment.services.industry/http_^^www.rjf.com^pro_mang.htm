Eagle offers a broad range of investment solutions which allow clients to tailor investment programs to meet individual needs. There can be no assurance that their objectives will be attained. 

<UL>
<LI type=square><B>Growth Equity: </B>Portfolio Manager Ken Corba seeks to invest in companies that create wealth for investors over a long period of time. By combining the characteristics of growth, quality and time, Ken's investment process is designed to capture the powerful compounding effect of a growing enterprise.

<LI><B>Value Equity (value equity and value equity-mid cap): </B>Portfolio Manager Michael Chren seeks securities which are trading at a discount to their underlying intrinsic value. He believes that patience creates opportunities to purchase securities of superior businesses at attractive prices.

<LI><B>Equity Income:</B> Portfolio Managers Lou Kirschbaum and David Blount seek securities of companies which offer a high and steadily growing income stream, thereby providing portfolios with the characteristics of income, growth, and stability. These portfolios are diversified among common stocks, utilities, convertible bonds, preferred stocks and REITs.

<LI><B>SmallCap Equity: </B>Portfolio Manager Bert Boksen seeks to identify reasonably valued companies which have a catalyst for accelerated earnings growth. His extensive research process is designed to identify small companies before they become widely followed.

<LI><B>Fixed Income (government securities, high quality taxable, high quality tax-free and special fixed income): </B>Portfolio Manager Joe Blanton employs a conservative and contrarian approach to managing bonds, adjusting portfolios to anticipate and respond to changing market conditions. These conditions include interest rate trends, credit quality, liquidity, sector valuations, and Federal Reserve policy. The primary goal is to produce greater total returns - current income plus realized capital gains - than those of fixed income portfolios that are simply bought and held to maturity.

<LI><B>Select Balanced: </B>Designed for investors seeking a balance between the capital appreciation potential of stocks and the income and relative stability of bonds in a single portfolio. Clients first select an allocation balance between equities and fixed income securities. Next, the client selects an equity component - growth equity, value equity or equity income. Finally, clients may choose between government securities, high quality taxable, or high quality tax-free fixed income components.

<LI><B>Core Equity and Core Equity Plus: </B>Designed for investors who desire an asset allocation strategy that provides exposure to different equity styles. Core equity client portfolios typically contain 10 securities of each of the following: growth equity, value equity and equity income. Core equity plus client portfolios typically contain 10 securities of each of the following: growth equity, value equity and small cap equity.

<LI><B>Eagle International Equity Portfolio: </B>Managed through a subadvisory relationship with Martin Currie in Edinburgh, Scotland, portfolio management seeks reasonably valued securities in both established and emerging markets around the globe. For more complete information on the Eagle International Equity Portfolio, a prospectus is available detailing all fees and charges. Please read it carefully before you invest or send money.

<H1>Investment products and services</H1>
For more than 94 years B.C. Ziegler and Company has been providing quality
investments and services for its clients. In addition to Ziegler's signature
investments, such as church, healthcare and long-term care bonds, we offer
high-quality stock services, mutual funds, annuities, IRAs and unit investment
trusts, as well as a wide array of high-quality corporate and municipal
investment opportunities from the secondary market.<BR>
<BR>
We believe that everyone deserves a financially secure retirement, and we
help both employees and employers plan customized retirement plans. We assist
large and small companies needing pension or 401(k) plans. And for individuals,
we have mutual fund plans and a self-directed IRA program that provides
our clients with flexibility for choosing investments that best suit their
personal investment objectives.<BR>
<BR>
Whether our clients are looking for conservative or aggressive investments,
we can find a mutual fund that best meets a client's investment needs. We
offer mutual funds from many leading national fund families as well as our
own <A HREF="division.htm">Principal Preservation Portfolios</A>.<BR>
<BR>
A long-popular institutional investment, preferred stocks are now finding
a place in the portfolios of individual investors who seek a higher rate
of fixed income. Because of our preferred stock division, we are able to
offer our clients numerous types of preferred stocks that can provide monthly
or quarterly dividend income.<BR>
<BR>
Ziegler provides free, independent research reports on a variety of growth,
yield and value stocks. We approach common stock trading with the belief
that independent research provides our clients an objective approach to
building their portfolio. We see common stocks as part of an appropriately
diversified portfolio. <BR>

Implications of Microsoft's court injunction on Internet stocks.  In general, we believe that the restraining order will tend to make Microsoft (OTC-MSFT) more circumspect in its future 'tie-in' marketing practices that link OEM sales of one program with another.  Although the obvious initial beneficiary of the company's potentially more cautionary future posture is Netscape (OTC-NSCP), we believe that most legitimate competitors may well gain material benefits in time. - by:  <b>Phil Leigh</b>,  Raymond James &amp; Associates Equity Research Department. <br>For more information about Internet/Networking Stocks, please contact your Financial Advisor.

<H2>Planning for Life</H2>

<P>
Why do we talk about "Planning for Life?" By stressing "planning," we are telling our clients that haphazard investing rarely works; indeed everyone needs an investment plan. To facilitate this planning process, we encourage frequent and open communication between our clients and our Financial Advisors.
<P>
"Life" represents not only the life cycles which clients move through that often require changes in an investment plan but also the longevity for which we strive in our client/Financial Advisor relationships.
<P>
In developing a personal plan for each client, preservation of principal, generation of income and capital appreciation through asset allocation in long-term investments are foremost among our objectives. But our aspirations do not stop there.
<P>
We believe that our clients deserve even more, including - but certainly not limited to - a well trained Financial Advisor to work with them, experienced Associates to execute and process transactions, state-of-the-art computer systems to process information and one of the most highly regarded due diligence groups in the nation to review investment alternatives before they are offered.
<P>
In short, we provide a wide variety of investment and financial planning services to meet the needs of all clients, from the first-time investor to the most sophisticated trader, from institutions and municipalities to major corporations and fledgling businesses.
<P>
Meeting  our clients' investment and financial planning needs - first by striving to protect their principal and its buying power from inflation, then by working to enhance their financial position through income generation and capital appreciation - is our primary goal.
<P>
Today, Raymond James Financial (NYSE - RJF) provides financial services through our  three investment firms - <A HREF="rja/index.htm">Raymond James & Associates</A> (RJ&amp;A), <A HREF="imr/index.htm">Investment Management & Research</A> (IM&amp;R) and <A HREF="rts/index.htm">Robert Thomas Securities</A> (RTS) - which have 2,900 Financial Advisors in <A HREF="rjfzip.htm">1,000 locations</a> throughout the United States and overseas, as well as through our asset management subsidiaries - <a href="pro_mang.htm">Eagle Asset Management</a>,  <a href="her_cash.htm">Heritage Asset Management</a>, <a href="caril.htm">Carillon Asset Management</a>, the <a href="awad.htm">Awad & Associates</a> Division of Raymond James & Associates - which currently manage in excess of $7.8 billion. In addition, we offer banking services through the Raymond James Bank, FSB;  trust services through the <A HREF="trustser.htm">Raymond James Trust</A> Services Group; and <a href="ins.htm">life insurance and annuities</a> through the Planning Corporation of America Division of Raymond James & Associates, a general insurance agency.<P>We invite you to explore our site on the World Wide Web. Hopefully, you will find current information  which will increase your knowledge of investment alternatives and strategies, as well as the investment process. If you require additional information or assistance, please use the Office Locator by clicking on the link at the bottom of each page.

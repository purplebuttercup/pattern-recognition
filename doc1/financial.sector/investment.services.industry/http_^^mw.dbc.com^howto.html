	reading and agreeing to the terms and conditions, set forth by DBC and the exchanges, required for real-time service.<p></p>

	The exchanges require that you print the Service Subscription Agreement, although you do not have to fax it to us in order to 
	start your service.  All you have to do is click on the "I agree to the above terms and 
	conditions" link at the bottom the page until you come to the registration page.

	<font size=2><b><i>These pages contain terms and conditions set forth by the commodities and options exchanges.  Although you will only 
	be receiving equity data, if CBS MarketWatch RT were ever to offer commodity or option data in the future, you would not have to 
	repeat this process.  You would be 'pre-approved' to receive their data.</i></b></font>

	</li>
	<p>
	</p>
	<li>Payment.<br>
	In exchange for the Services requested by Subscriber in connection with Subscriber’s Account, Subscriber agrees to pay DBC/BMI the appropriate fees as listed on the Service Subscription Agreement.  All monthly subscription fees, Add-On Service fees, satellite, lease, Premium Service, and Data Provider fees payable to DBC/BMI are due in advance of the Next Statement Date which is printed on Subscriber’s current DBC/BMI Statement.  Subscription, Add-On Service and Data Provider fees payable to DBC/BMI for any partial month shall be prorated on a thirty (30) day per month basis.
		<ol type="a">
		<li>Payment By Credit Card:  Subscriber hereby authorizes DBC/BMI to use the credit card information furnished by Subscriber to DBC/BMI hereunder for purposes of fulfilling Subscriber’s payment obligations under this Agreement.  Subscriber further represents and warrants that (i) the credit card information provided to DBC/BMI  (card number, expiration date and card-holder’s name) is valid in all respects and lawfully authorized for use, and that (ii) such credit card belongs to Subscriber or has been authorized for use by Subscriber by the valid card-holder ("Subscriber’s Credit Card").  Upon expiration of the Subscriber’s Credit Card, Subscriber shall notify DBC/BMI of the new credit card expiration date and any other relevant new information pertaining to the new credit card.</li>
		<li>Late and Returned Check Charges: Payments not received by the DBC/BMI Next Statement Date, as designated on each monthly Statement, will be assessed a late charge of $10.00 and Subscriber may thereafter be charged up to the maximum legal interest on any unpaid balance.  Payments returned to DBC/BMI for insufficient funds will result in a service charge of $10.00 to Subscriber.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<p>
	</p>
	<li>Subscription Options.
		<ol type="a">
		<li>Annual Prepaid Subscriptions:  If applicable, Subscribers may structure the billing of their Accounts as Annual Prepaid Subscriptions, in which Subscriber prepays all fees associated with the receipt of Services for twelve (12) consecutive months.  All Annual Prepaid Subscription fees are nonrefundable, nontransferable and exclude Add-On Service, Data Provider, satellite and hardware usage/lease fees.  Add-On Service, Data Provider and satellite fees are billed on a monthly basis.    
		<p>
		</p>
		Prior to the Next Statement Date as shown on the next to last Statement for the Annual Prepaid Subscription, Subscriber must notify DBC/BMI to renew the Annual Prepaid Subscription.  If no notification is received, Subscriber’s Account will automatically  convert to an Annual Billed Monthly Subscription for BMI accounts and a monthly Subscription for DBC accounts.
		<p>
		</p>
		Example  1 (DBC Annual Prepaid Subscriptions):   If Subscriber opened his/her Account with DBC on March 1, 1997 on an Annual Prepaid basis and, at the end of such subscription desired to terminate the subscription, Subscriber would be required to give notice of termination prior to the Next Statement Date shown on Subscriber’s January, 1998 bill.  Since Subscriber’s bill for January, 1998 would arrive on approximately January 1, 1998, and might show a Next Statement Date of January 20, 1998, Subscriber would be required to give notice of termination prior to January 20, 1998 in order for his/her Annual Prepaid Subscription to be effectively terminated for March, 1998.  Failure of Subscriber to give notice prior to January 20, 1998 would result in Subscriber’s Account reverting to a Monthly Subscription for DBC accounts.
		<p>
		</p>
		Example  2 (BMI Annual Prepaid Subscriptions):   If Subscriber opened his/her Account with BMI on March 10, 1997 on an Annual Prepaid basis and, at the end of such subscription desired to terminate the subscription, Subscriber would be required to give notice of termination up through the last business day of the month following the expiration of the current contract term.  In the above example, this would terminate subscription on March 31, 1998.
		<p>
		</p>
		Failure of Subscriber to give notice prior to March 10, 1998 would result in Subscriber’s Account reverting to an Annual Billed Monthly Subscription for BMI accounts.
		<p>
		</p>
		Online Service Cancellation.  Upon the last date of your twelve (12) month consecutive contract period,  your annual Agreement will automatically renew for another (12) consecutive months unless you give DBC notice prior to the end of the current contracted period. 
		<p>
		</p>
		For cancellation terms, refer to Section 10 of this Agreement.</li>
		<li>Annual Billed Monthly Subscriptions.  If applicable, Subscribers may structure the billing of their Accounts as Annual Billed Monthly Subscriptions, in which Subscriber pays monthly for the receipt of Services for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months.  All Annual Billed Monthly Subscription fees are nonrefundable, nontransferable, and exclude Add-On Service, Data Provider, satellite and hardware usage/lease fees.  Furthermore, fees for Services that Subscriber would have paid for the balance of the annual period will be charged to Subscribers who terminate their Accounts in the initial twelve month subscription term.  Add-On Service, Data Provider and satellite fees are billed on a monthly basis.  Hardware usage/lease fees may be prepaid or billed on a monthly basis at the Subscriber’s option. Subscriber’s Annual Billed Monthly account with DBC/BMI shall continue as an Annual Billed Monthly subscription account and Subscriber shall be obligated to DBC/BMI for all applicable monthly subscription fees
		<p>
		</p>
		DBC/BMI is authorized to charge any unpaid Annual Billed Monthly Subscription fees to Subscriber’s Credit Card pursuant to Section 2(d) of the Agreement.
		</li>
		<p>
		</p>
		For cancellation terms, refer to Section 10 of this Agreement.
		<li>Monthly Subscriptions:  If applicable, Subscribers may structure the billing of their Accounts as Monthly Subscriptions, in which Subscriber pays monthly for his/her Account.  All Monthly Subscriptions shall include a surcharge, to be determined by DBC/BMI and subject to change without notice, over the monthly subscription rate for Annual Billed Monthly Subscriptions, and hardware usage fees must be prepaid.  Add-On Service, Data Provider and satellite fees are billed on a monthly basis.</li>
		<li>Thirty (30)Day Trial:  For the first thirty (30) calendar days of Subscriber’s receipt of a product, Subscriber may cancel the Product and receive a refund of hardware usage, lease, deposit, Service, and satellite fees paid by Subscriber, if applicable. Data Provider, Premium Services, Registration and shipping fees are not refundable. Subscriber is entitled to only one (1) 30-Day Trial with each product. For example, Subscriber is entitled to one 30-Day Trial for Subscriber’s initial receipt of a particular product, but not for individual Services related to the Product  that the Subscriber may select at a later date.</li>
		<p>
		</p>
		There is no thirty (30) trial for on-line services, with the exception of StockEdge On-line and Signal On-line.</li>
		<p>
		</p>
		<li>Initial Registration and Restart Fees:  Subscriber may restart an Account which he/she had previously subscribed to at any time subject to payment in full of a restart fee, at least one month subscription, Service, Data Provider, satellite, lease, and shipping (if applicable) fees and any past due balance remaining on the Account.  Subscribers who have canceled within the 30-day trial period discussed in 2(d) above and have received applicable refunds, and choose to reactivate the particular Service shall be assessed registration, usage, and shipping fees along with the initial subscription, Service, Data Provider, satellite and lease fees, where applicable.  </li>
		<li>Fee Changes: Subscriber acknowledges that Service fees are subject to change at any time without advance notice and that any individual Data Provider fees are subject to change in accordance with the terms of each Data Provider.</li>
		<li>Changes In Subscription Service.  Subscriber may add additional Exchanges or Services offered by DBC/BMI by written request to DBC/BMI, subject to confirmation and receipt of properly signed contracts (if applicable), and to payment of all applicable fees. All fees added are prorated on the basis of a 30 day month. </li>
		<li>Charges For Failure To Return Equipment:  If Subscriber fails to return Equipment pursuant to Section 7(a) within thirty (30) days after termination of the Service or Services requiring the Equipment, Subscriber shall be charged the full retail value of the Equipment.  If all outstanding fees are not paid within thirty (30) days of DBC/BMI’s closing Statement, all legal remedies may be taken by DBC/BMI against Subscriber.  If Subscriber is a credit card customer, DBC/BMI reserves the right to charge such amount against Subscriber’s Credit Card. </li>
		<li>Taxes:  All applicable sales and use taxes arising from Subscriber’s Account shall be paid by Subscriber, whether or not such taxes are included in the fees as listed on the Service  Subscription Agreement or assessed by the taxing authority to DBC/BMI or Subscriber.</li>

    <li>The word &quot;Corporations&quot; means The Nasdaq Stock
        Market, Inc. and its affiliates. The word
        &quot;Information&quot; means certain data and other
        information: relating to securities or other financial
        instruments, products, vehicles or devices; or relating
        to Persons regulated by the Corporations or to activities
        of the Corporations; or gathered by the Corporations from
        other sources. The word &quot;or&quot; includes the word
        &quot;and&quot;. The phrase &quot;Claims or Losses&quot;
        means any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
        damages, penalties, claims, actions, suits, costs,
        judgments, settlements, and expenses of whatever nature,
        whether incurred by or issued against an indemnified
        party or a third party, including, without limitation,
        (1) indirect, special, punitive, consequential or
        incidental loss or damage, (including, but not limited
        to, trading losses, loss of anticipated profits, loss by

        &quot;Person&quot; means any natural person,
        proprietorship, corporation, partnership, or other entity
        whatsoever. The phrase &quot;Non-Professional
        Subscriber&quot; means any natural person who is neither:
        (a) registered or qualified in any capacity with the SEC,
        the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, any state
        securities agency, any securities exchange or
        association, or any commodities or futures contract
        market or association; (b) engaged as an &quot;investment
        advisor&quot; as that term is defined in Section 201 (11)
        of the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 (whether or not
        registered or qualified under that Act); nor, (c)
        employed by a bank or other organization exempt from
        registration under federal or state securities laws to
        perform functions that would require registration or
        qualification if such functions were performed for an
        organization not so exempt. The phrase &quot;Professional
        Subscriber&quot; means all other persons who do not meet
        the definition of Non-Professional Subscriber. When it
        appears alone, the word &quot;Subscriber&quot;
        encompasses all Non-Professional and Professional
        Subscribers. The phrase &quot;Vendor's Service&quot;
        means the service from a vendor, including the data
        processing equipment, software, and communications
        facilities related thereto, for receiving, processing,
        transmitting, using and disseminating the Information to
        or by Subscriber.</li>
    <li>Subscriber is granted the right to receive from Nasdaq
        the Information under the terms stated herein or in the
        NASD Rules. &quot;NASD Rules&quot; shall mean all
        applicable laws (including intellectual property,
        communications, and securities laws), statutes, and
        regulations, the rules and regulations of the SEC, the
        rules and regulations of the Corporations including, but
        not limited to, those requirements established by the
        Corporations' rule filings (with such SEC approval as may
        be required), the Corporations' decisions and
        interpretations and any User Guides, or successors of the
        components of the NASD Rules, as they may exist at the
        time. If any payment is due directly to Nasdaq under this
        Agreement, payment in full is due Nasdaq in immediately
        available U.S. funds, within 30 days of date of invoice,
        whether or not use is made of the Information. Interest
        shall be due from the date of the invoice to the time
        that the amount(s) that are due have been paid.
        Subscriber shall assume full and complete responsibility
        for the payment of any taxes, charges or assessments
        imposed on Subscriber or Nasdaq (except for U.S. federal,
        state, or local income taxes, if any, imposed on Nasdaq)
        by any foreign or domestic national, state, provincial or
        local governmental bodies, or subdivisions thereof, and
        any penalties or interest, relating to the provision of
        the Information to Subscriber.</li>
    <li>The Information is licensed only for the personal use of
        the Non-Professional Subscriber and the internal use in
        the business of the Professional Subscriber. By
        representing to Vendor that Subscriber is a
        non-professional, or by continuing to receive the
        Information at a non-professional subscriber rate,
        Subscriber is affirming to Vendor and the Corporations
        that Subscriber meets the definition of Non-Professional
        Subscriber as set forth in paragraph 1 above. Subscriber
        will promptly give written notice to Vendor of any change
        in the name or place of residence or place of business at
        which the Information is received. Subscriber may not
        sell, lease, furnish or otherwise permit or provide
        access to the Information to any other Person or to any
        other office, or place. Subscriber will not engage in the
        operation of any illegal business; use or permit anyone
        else to use the Information, or any part thereof, for any
        illegal purpose; or violate any NASD Rule. Professional
        Subscribers may, on a non-continuous basis, furnish
        limited amounts of the Information to customers: in
        written advertisements, correspondence, or other
        literature; or during voice telephonic conversations not
        entailing computerized voice, automated information
        inquiry systems, or similar technologies. Subscriber may
        not present the Information rendered in any unfair,
        misleading, or discriminatory format. Subscriber shall
        take reasonable security precautions to prevent
        unauthorized Persons from gaining access to the
        Information.</li>
    <li>Subscriber acknowledges that Nasdaq, in its sole
        discretion, may from time to time make modifications to
        its system or the Information. Such modifications may
        require corresponding changes to be made in Vendor's
        Service. Changes or the failure to make timely changes by
        Vendor or Subscriber may sever or affect Subscriber's
        access to or use of the Information. Nasdaq shall not be
        responsible for such effects.</li>
    <li>Nasdaq grants to Subscriber a nonexclusive,
        non-transferable license during the term of the Agreement
        to receive and use the Information transmitted to it by
        Vendor and thereafter to use such Information for any
        purpose not inconsistent with the terms of the Agreement
        or with the NASD Rules. Subscriber acknowledges and
        agrees that the Corporations have proprietary rights in
        the Information that originates on or derives from
        markets regulated or operated by the Corporations and
        compilation or other rights in Information gathered from
        other sources. Subscriber further acknowledges and agrees
        that the Corporations' third party Information providers
        have exclusive proprietary rights in their respective
        Information. In the event of any misappropriation or
        misuse, Nasdaq or its third party information providers
        shall have the right to obtain injunctive relief for its
        respective materials. Subscriber will attribute source as
        appropriate under all the circumstances.</li>
    <li>Subscriber acknowledges that Nasdaq, as a subsidiary of
        NASD, when required to do so by NASD in fulfillment of
        NASD's statutory obligations, may by notice to Vendor
        unilaterally limit or terminate the right of any or all
        Persons to receive or use the Information, and that
        Vendor will immediately comply with any such notice and
        will terminate or limit the furnishing of the Information
        and confirm such compliance by notice to Nasdaq. Any
        affected Person will have available to it such procedural
        protections as are provided by the Exchange Act and
        applicable rules thereunder. Neither Nasdaq nor NASD
        shall have any liability when complying with such NASD
        notice.</li>
    <li>Subscriber will maintain such accurate and verifiable
        records regarding the use of the Information and
        including the number and location of all devices that
        receive the Information, as may be required, and will
        make these records available for a period of 3 years in a
        form acceptable to Nasdaq for inspection by Nasdaq's
        auditors upon reasonable notice. Subscriber shall make
        its premises available to Nasdaq for review of said
        records and for physical inspection of Vendor's Service
        and of Subscriber's use of the Information, all at
        reasonable times, upon reasonable notice, to ensure
        compliance with this Agreement.</li>
    <li>To the extent permitted by applicable law, Subscriber
        acknowledges and agrees that the termination of the
        Vendor's Service for failure to make payments shall not
        be deemed or considered to be, and Subscriber waives any
        right to represent or assert that any such exercise
        constitutes, an act or omission or an improper denial or
        limitation of access by Nasdaq to any service or facility
        operated by Nasdaq as contemplated in Section 11A of the
        Exchange Act, or any other provision of the Exchange Act,
        or any rule, regulation, or interpretation adopted
        thereunder.</li>
    <li><b>NASDAQ'S WARRANTIES/DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.</b>
        Nasdaq shall endeavor to offer the Information as
        promptly and accurately as is reasonably practicable. In
        the event that the Information is not available as a
        result of a failure by Nasdaq to peRFORM ITS OBLIGATIONS
        UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, NASDAQ WILL ENDEAVOR, GIVING DUE

    <li>Notwithstanding any other term or condition of this
        Agreement, Nasdaq, its third party information providers
        or Subscriber shall not be obligated to perform or

        Agreement (except for obligations to make payments
        hereunder and regulatory obligations) if prevented or
        hindered from doing so by any circumstances found to be
        beyond their control.</li>
    <li>Subscriber will indemnify and hold harmless the
        Corporations and their employees, officers, directors,
        and other agents from any and all Claims or Losses
        imposed on, incurred by or asserted as a result of or
        relating to: (a) any noncompliance by Subscriber with the
        terms and conditions hereof; (b) any third-party actions
        related to Subscriber's receipt and use of the

        a claim of infringement or other violation of an
        intellectual property right by the indemnifying party,
        its actions or omissions, equipment, or other property.
        This right is conditioned on the indemnified party giving
        prompt written notice to the indemnifying party (as does
        not prejudice the defense) of the Claims or Losses and
        providing cooperation in the defense of the Claims or

        injunctive relief or damages, with the prevailing party
        being awarded costs and attorneys' fees (including
        in-house counsel).</li>
    <li>In the event of any conflict between the terms of this
        Agreement and of the Vendor's agreement, the terms of
        this Agreement shall prevail as between the Corporations
        and Subscriber.</li>
    <li>In addition to terminations permitted under the Vendor's
        agreement, this Agreement may be terminated by Subscriber
        on 30 days written notice to Vendor and by the
        Corporations on 30 days written notice either to Vendor
        or Subscriber. Nasdaq may also alter any term of this
        Agreement on 60 days written notice either to Vendor or
        Subscriber, and any use after such date is deemed
        acceptance of the new terms. In the event of Subscriber
        breach, discovery of the untruth of any representation of
        Subscriber, or where directed by NASD in its regulatory
        authority, Nasdaq may terminate this Agreement on not
        less than three (3) days written notice to Subscriber
        provided either by Nasdaq or Vendor.</li>

        invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby
        and each such term and provision of this Agreement shall
        be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted

                derived from the foregoing and that convey

    <li><b>PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN THE MARKET DATA.</b> <ol
        type="A">
            <li>Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that each of
                the Exchanges has exclusive and valuable property
                rights in and to its own Market Data, that such
                Market Data constitute valuable confidential
                information, trade secrets and/or proprietary
                rights of each of the Exchanges, not within the
                public domain, that such Market Data shall remain
                valuable confidential information, trade secrets
                and/or proprietary rights of each of the
                Exchanges at least until the Exchanges place
                their respective Market Data in the public domain
                or authorize placement of their respective Market
                Data in the public domain, and that, but for this
                Addendum, Subscriber would have no rights or
                access to such Market Data. Whether or not a
                particular Exchange has placed its Market Data in
                the public domain or has authorized the placement
                of its Market Data in the public domain shall be
                determined according to the terms of such
                Exchange's agreement with Vendor, which agreement
                is described in Section 3(a).</li>
            <li>Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that
                disclosure of any Market Data, or any breach or
                threatened breach of any other covenants or
                agreements contained herein, would cause
                irreparable injury to each of the Exchanges for
                which money damages would be an inadequate
                remedy. Accordingly, Subscriber further
                acknowledges and agrees that each of the
                Exchanges shall be entitled to specific
                performance and injunctive and other equitable
                relief from the breach or threatened breach of
                any provision, requirement or covenant of this
                Addendum (including, without limitation, any
                disclosure or threatened disclosure of Market
                Data) in addition to and not in limitation of any
                other legal or equitable remedies which may be
                available.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b>RECEIPT OF MARKET DATA BY SUBSCRIBER.</b> <ol type="A">
            <li>Vendor and Subscriber have entered into an
                agreement by which Vendor will, among other
                things, provide Subscriber with Market Data.
                Vendor has entered into agreements with each of
                the Exchanges whereby Vendor has been granted the
                right to receive Market Data and to retransmit
                the same to Subscriber. This Addendum to the
                agreement between Vendor and Subscriber sets
                forth the terms and conditions upon which
                Subscriber may receive and use Market Data.
                Subscriber acknowledges that, notwithstanding
                such agreement, each of the Exchanges may, in its
                discretion, discontinue disseminating its own
                Market Data or change or eliminate its own
                transmission method, speed or signal
                characteristics. In addition, Subscriber
                acknowledges and agrees that the Exchanges
                reserve the right to disapprove any Subscriber
                and retains the right to direct Vendor to
                terminate any Subscriber's receipt of Market Data
                for any reason or no reason, in which event the
                Exchanges shall so notify Vendor and Vendor shall
                cease providing Market Data to Subscriber as soon
                as practicable.</li>
            <li>(1) Except as provided in (2) below, Subscriber
                will use Market Data only for its own internal
                business activities and only at the offices and
                locations and on the Devices designated by
                Subscriber in writing to Vendor from
                time-to-time. Subscriber agrees that it will not
                communicate or otherwise furnish, or permit to be
                communicated or otherwise furnished, the Market
                Data, in any format, to any other party or any
                office or location other than that designated
                above, nor allow any other party to take,
                directly or indirectly, any of the Market Data
                from such offices or locations, and will adopt
                and enforce any policy that is reasonable to
                prevent the Market Data from being taken
                therefrom. Subscriber will abide by any other
                limitations on such use that any of the Exchanges
                may specify. Subscriber will use its best efforts
                to ensure that its partners, officers, directors,
                employees and agents maintain sole control and
                physical possession of, and sole access to,
                Market Data received through Devices in
                Subscriber's possession. (2) Notwithstanding (1)
                above, Subscriber may, in the regular course of
                its business, occasionally furnish, to each of
                its customers, branch offices, and guaranteed
                introducing brokers, in a quantity restricted to
                that necessary to enable Subscriber to conduct
                its business, a de minimis number of segments of
                Market Data. Such redissemination must be
                strictly limited to telephonic communications not
                entailing the use of computerized voice
                synthesization or any other technology and must
                be strictly related to the trading activity of
                Subscriber or any such recipients. Any such
                recipients must be advised by Subscriber that
                such segments are proprietary and confidential
                information not to be disclosed or disseminated
                to other persons or entities. Subscriber agrees
                to make all reasonable efforts to ensure that
                such recipients abide by the provisions of this
                Addendum.</li>
            <li>In the event that Vendor has agreed to permit
                Subscriber to receive, access or display Market
                Data through means other than a Vendor-provided
                Device, such as by means of: (i) the Internet,
                any Intranet or any other type of network; (ii)
                portable Devices (e.g., pocket pagers, personal
                digital assistants, laptop computers, etc.); and
                (iii) synthesized voice responses over
                telephones, Subscriber will use its best efforts
                to ensure that no other device, attachment or
                apparatus is used which may allow third parties
                not subject to Subscriber's reporting obligations
                under Section 3(b) above to access the Market
                Data.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b>REPORTING.</b> <br>
        Upon request, Subscriber agrees to furnish promptly to
        Vendor any information or reports that may be required by
        any of the Exchanges as applicable and that is reasonably
        related to Subscriber's receipt of Market Data.
        Subscriber further agrees to furnish promptly to Vendor
        any additional information or reports that may be
        required by the agreement between Vendor and Subscriber
        referred to in Section 3(a) as it relates to Subscriber's
        receipt of Market Data.</li>
    <li><b>RIGHT OF INSPECTION AND AUDIT.</b> <br>
        During regular business hours, any Persons designated by
        any Exchange may have access to Subscriber's offices or
        locations in order to observe the use made of the Market
        Data and to examine and inspect any Devices, attachments
        or apparatuses, as well as any books and records required
        to be maintained by Subscriber under Sections 3(b) and 4
        in connection with its receipt and use of Market Data.
        Subscriber will make prompt adjustment (including
        interest thereon at the rate of 1% per month), through
        Vendor, to compensate any Exchange that discovers an
        under-reported use of the Market Data by Subscriber. In
        addition, at the election of any such Exchange,
        Subscriber will be liable for the reasonable costs of any
        audit that reveals a discrepancy in such Exchange's favor
        of five percent (5%) or more of the amount of fees
        actually due such Exchange. Subscriber shall maintain the
        records and books upon which it bases its reporting for
        CME, CBOT or MID-AM Market Data for three (3) years
        following the period to which the records relate.
        Subscriber shall maintain the records and books upon
        which it bases the reporting for NYMEX or COMEX Market
        Data for six (6) years following the period to which the
        records and books relate. In the event that Subscriber
        fails to retain such records and books as required above,
        Subscriber agrees to pay each Exchange's reasonable
        estimate of any discrepancy discovered pursuant to any
        such audit.</li>
    <li><b>EXCHANGE FEES.</b> <br>
        Subscriber will pay Vendor (unless Vendor has assumed
        Subscriber's payment obligations hereunder), for and on
        behalf of each of the Exchanges (as applicable), for the
        right to receive Market Data in accordance with the
        then-current fee schedule published by each of the
        Exchanges from time-to- time (including any and all
        applicable federal, state or local taxes). Each
        Exchange's fees are subject to modification by each of
        them at any time, without prior notice to Subscriber. In
        addition, Subscriber agrees to pay Vendor any penalties
        assessed against Subscriber by Vendor on behalf of any
        Exchange. Nothing herein shall limit a Vendor's
        obligation pursuant to separate agreement between Vendor
        and any of the Exchanges (as applicable) to pay Exchange
        fees.</li>
    <li><b>COVENANTS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
        SUBSCRIBER.</b> <br>
        Subscriber covenants, represents and warrants that it is
        not engaged in the business of distributing Market Data
        and that, to its knowledge after reasonable inquiry, it
        is receiving the Market Data from a Vendor that is
        authorized by the Exchanges to distribute the Market
        Data. Subscriber agrees that it will not use or permit
        any other Person to use Market Data for any illegal
        purpose. Subscriber agrees that it will not use Market
        Data in any way to compete with the Exchanges or Vendor,
        nor use the Market Data in any way so as to assist or
        allow a third party to compete with the Exchanges or
        Vendor. Subscriber agrees that the provision of Market
        Data by the Exchanges hereunder is conditioned upon
        Subscriber's strict compliance with the terms of this
        Addendum and that Vendor may, with or without notice and
        with or without cause, forthwith discontinue said service
        whenever in its judgment there has been any default or
        breach by Subscriber of the provisions hereof, or
        whenever directed to do so by any of the Exchanges.</li>
    <li><b>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.</b> <br>
        SUBSCRIBER AGREES THAT NEITHER VENDOR NOR THE EXCHANGES
        MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
        IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE MARKET DATA, OR THE
        TRANSMISSION, TIMELINESS, ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS
        THEREOF, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED
        WARRANTIES OR ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, QUALITY
        OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND THOSE ARISING BY
        STATUTE OR OTHERWISE IN LAW OR FROM ANY COURSE OF DEALING
        OR USAGE OF TRADE.</li>
    <li><b>LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND DAMAGES.</b> <br>
        Subscriber agrees that: (i) the provision of Market Data
        is made with equipment, communications devices, and/or
        leased lines not owned or operated solely by Vendor or
        the Exchanges; (ii) neither Vendor nor the Exchanges, nor
        their respective members, directors, officers, employees
        or agents, guarantees the sequence, accuracy or
        completeness of the Market Data, nor shall any of them be
        liable to Subscriber or any other Person for any delays,
        inaccuracies, errors or omissions in Market Data, or in
        the transmission thereof, or for any other damages
        arising in connection with Subscriber's receipt or use of
        Market Data, whether or not resulting from negligence on
        their part, a Force Majeure Event or any other cause
        beyond their reasonable control; and (iii) if the
        foregoing disclaimer and limitation of liability should
        be deemed invalid or ineffective by a court of competent
        jurisdiction, neither Vendor nor the Exchanges, nor their
        respective members, directors, officers, employees or
        agents shall be liable for any of the foregoing beyond
        the actual amount of loss or damage, or the sum of fifty
        dollars ($50.00), whichever is less.</li>
    <li><b>TERM AND TERMINATION.</b> <br>
        Subject to Subscriber's strict compliance with the
        provisions of this Addendum, the provision of Market Data
        by any of the Exchanges hereunder will continue in force
        during the term of the agreement between Subscriber and
        Vendor and any renewal term thereof. In addition, it is
        understood that the provisions set forth in paragraphs
        2(a) and 2(b) of this Addendum shall survive the
        termination of this Addendum.</li>
    <li><b>INDEMNIFICATION.</b> <br>
        Subscriber will indemnify and hold Vendor and the
        Exchanges, and their respective members, directors,
        officers, employees and agents harmless from and against
        any and all claims arising out of or in connection with
        this Addendum, including, without limitation, any
        liability, loss or damages caused by any inaccuracy in or
        omission from, Subscriber's failure to furnish or to
        keep, or Subscriber's delay in furnishing or keeping, any
        report or record required to be kept by Subscriber
        hereunder.</li>
    <li><b>MISCELLANEOUS.</b> <br>
        In case of any breach by Subscriber of its obligations
        hereunder, each of the Exchanges will be considered to be
        a third-party beneficiary of this Addendum and may bring
        an action to enforce its terms directly against
        Subscriber. Any action arising out of this Addendum
        between the CME, CBOT or MID-AM and Subscriber shall be
        governed and construed in accordance with the internal
        laws (and not the law of conflicts) of the State of
        Illinois. Any action arising out of this Addendum between
        NYMEX or COMEX and Subscriber shall be governed and
        construed in accordance with the internal laws (and not
        the law of conflicts) of the State of New York.
        Subscriber may not assign all or any part of this
        Addendum without the prior written consent of the
        Exchanges (as applicable). Neither Vendor nor Subscriber
        may modify or amend the terms of this Addendum. In the
        event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of
        this Addendum and any other agreement relating to
        Subscriber's receipt and use of Market Data, including,
        without limitation, the agreement between Vendor and
        Subscriber referred to in Section 3(a), the terms and
        conditions of this Addendum will prevail. If, for any
        reason, one or more provisions of this Addendum is held
        invalid, the other provisions of the Agreement shall
        remain in full force and effect.</li>

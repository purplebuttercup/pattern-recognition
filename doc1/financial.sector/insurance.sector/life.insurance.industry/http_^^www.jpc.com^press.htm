<CENTER><H3>JEFFERSON-PILOT REPORTS RECORD THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
WITH OPERATING EARNINGS PER SHARE UP 17.8 PERCENT</H3></CENTER>

(GREENSBORO - October 29, 1997) -- Jefferson- Pilot Corporation reported today that its earnings per share before realized investment gains for the third quarter of 1997 increased 17.8 percent to a record level of $1.06 from $0.90 in the third quarter of 1996.  Total earnings per share including realized investment gains reached $1.12 for the quarter, up 7.7 percent from $1.04 a year earlier.
<BR><BR>
For the first nine months of 1997,  Jefferson-Pilot’s earnings per share from operations increased 15.2 percent to $3.10 from $2.69 in the same period of 1996, while total earnings per share including realized investment gains were up 34.5 percent to $4.09 from $3.04.  Realized investment gains were unusually large in the first half of 1997 due to sales of appreciated securities to finance the May 1997 acquisition of Chubb Life.
<BR><BR>
With strong individual life insurance profit gains, Jefferson-Pilot’s earnings available to common stockholders before realized investment gains increased 17.9 percent in the third quarter and 14.6 percent year to date.  Individual life insurance profits increased 62.5 percent to $60,185,000 from $37,039,000 in the quarter and gained 38.4 percent to $154,346,000 from $111,513,000 for the nine months.  The Chubb Life operations have been adding earnings since completion of the acquisition effective May 1, 1997 and made a significant contribution to Jefferson-Pilot’s third quarter individual life insurance results.
<BR><BR>
Earnings from annuity and investment products, while lower for the quarter at $16,036,000 versus $17,964,000 a year earlier, increased 11.9 percent year to date to $53,540,000 from $47,863,000.
<BR><BR>
Group insurance earnings declined in the quarter to $2,065,000 from $5,516,000, and totaled $12,363,000 for the nine months, compared to $20,659,000 in the 1996 period.  Group life insurance profitability was satisfactory in the quarter, but group medical insurance lines reflected adverse market conditions.
<BR><BR>
Jefferson-Pilot Communications Company recorded quarterly earnings of $5,682,000, down slightly from very strong profits of $5,791,000 a year earlier.  Year to date, Communications’ earnings totaled $18,187,000 compared to $20,777,000 in the same period of 1996.  The 1996 period included tax refunds and related interest amounts, without which year-to-date earnings would have been approximately flat.  The Communications Company’s broadcast cash flow was up 6 percent for the quarter and almost 14 percent year to date.
<BR><BR>
Jefferson- Pilot Chief Executive Officer <A HREF="http://www.jpc.com/jpl-pres.htm">David A. Stonecipher</A> stated in reviewing the third quarter and year-to-date results that  “Our acquisition of Chubb Life already can be judged a tremendous success. These operations, as we expected, have bolstered our presence and profitability in the individual life insurance business substantially, and we are very pleased with the contributions of Chubb’s people and operations.  Overall, this was a good quarter, although we continue to have work to do to bring our group insurance business back to satisfactory profit levels.”

<CENTER><H3>JEFFERSON-PILOT REPORTS 15.2 PERCENT INCREASE IN SECOND QUARTER OPERATING EARNINGS</H3></CENTER>
                     
(GREENSBORO, NC - July 29, 1997) - Jefferson-Pilot Corporation reported today that its second-quarter earnings before realized investment gains increased 15.2 percent to $1.06 per share from $0.92 in the second quarter of 1996.  For the first six months of 1997, earnings before realized gains increased 14.0 percent to $2.04 from $1.79 for the first half of 1996.  During the first and second quarters of 1997, Jefferson-Pilot sold appreciated investments to finance the acquisition of Chubb Life, resulting in unusually large realized investment gains.  Including such investment gains, total second-quarter earnings per share increased 41.2 percent to $1.44 from $1.02 a year ago, and total six-month earnings increased 48.5 percent to $2.97 per share from $2.00 per share.<BR><BR>

Jefferson-Pilot's earnings available to common stockholders before realized investment gains increased 14.8 percent for the second quarter and 12.9 percent for the six months. This strong performance was led by individual life insurance operations, with a 37.3 percent profit advance to $52,354,000 from $38,143,000 for the quarter,  and a gain of 24.3 percent year to date to $94,167,000 from $75,774,000.  Chubb Life operations, acquired effective May 1, 1997, began to contribute to Jefferson-Pilot's earnings in the second quarter.<BR><BR>

Earnings from Jefferson-Pilot's annuity and investment products business also posted a substantial increase of 19.5 percent to $18,344,000 from $15,356,000 for the quarter, with first-half earnings up 30.4 percent to $37,290,000 from $28,599,000.<BR><BR>

Group insurance results, continuing to reflect difficult industry conditions in the medical insurance business, declined to $4,673,000 for the quarter from $8,456,000, and, for the six months, amounted to $10,510,000 versus $15,143,000 a year earlier.  Notwithstanding weakness in accident and health insurance lines, group life insurance earnings were up for both the quarter and first half.<BR><BR>

Jefferson-Pilot Communications Company earned $5,581,000 in the quarter, down slightly from $5,811,000 a year ago.  First-half 1997 communications profits totaled $12,505,000, compared to $14,986,000 in the same period of 1996. The 1996 results included tax refunds and related interest, which, if excluded, makes six-month results approximately level year to year.<BR><BR>

Commenting on the second quarter, Jefferson-Pilot Chief Executive David Stonecipher noted that "Jefferson-Pilot's core life insurance and annuity operations continued to perform very well in the second quarter.  In addition, we achieved an important milestone with the completion of the Chubb Life acquisition, which has considerably raised our profile and strengthened our 
market presence. We believe that Jefferson-Pilot remains solidly on track as an emerging leader in the life insurance industry."<BR>

<FONT SIZE=5 color=green><B><I>Jefferson-Pilot Operating Earnings Per Share Increase 17.3 Percent for 1996</I></B></FONT>
<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=3>
GREENSBORO, N.C., Feb. 6/PRNewswire/ -- Jefferson-Pilot Corporation (NYSE: JP) reported today that 1996 earnings per share before realized gains from sales of investments increased 17.3 percent to a record $3.66 from $3.12 in 1995.  Realized investment gains totaled $0.43 per share for 1996 versus $0.69 for 1995, bringing total 1996 earnings per share to $4.09, up 7.3 percent from the 1995 total earnings of $3.81.  Realized gains for 1995 included gains of $0.23 per share arising from the sale of discontinued operations.  Excluding such gains, total earnings per share increased by 14.2 percent in 1996.  Operating income for 1996 reached a record $290,529,000 up 14.2 percent from $254,456,000 in 1995.  Net income available to common shareholders increased 6.4 percent to $290,529,000 in 1996 from $272,997,000 in 1995.  For the fourth quarter of 1996, Jefferson-Pilot earned $0.97 per share before realized investment gains, compared to very strong earnings of $1.00 per share in the final quarter of 1995.  Total fourth-quarter earnings including investment gains reached $1.05 per share versus $1.21 a year earlier.

<P>

Jefferson-Pilot benefited substantially in 1996 from the earnings contribution of Alexander Hamilton Life, acquired effective for the fourth quarter of 1995.  In addition, the Kentucky Central Life business also acquired in1995, produced very satisfactory results.  Each of the company's business units experienced excellent earnings growth in 1996 with the exception of the group accident and health insurance line, which continued to be subject to significant competitive pressure.  Steps are being taken to stabilize and improve group insurance operating results going forward.

<P>

Sales growth in Jefferson-Pilot's core individual life insurance business continued to be exceptionally strong, with annualized premiums sales increasing almost 56 percent for 1996.  This gain resulted from both internal growth and the additional capability provided by Alexander Hamilton Life.
<P>

"Jefferson-Pilot's strong overall results were consistent with our growth strategies for our major businesses," observed Chief Executive Officer David Stonecipher.  "Our excellent individual life and annuity performance was particularly gratifying, and was accompanied by very strong growth in our Communications business.  Our strategy of simultaneously building internally and growing through acquisition is positioning Jefferson-Pilot as an industry leader."

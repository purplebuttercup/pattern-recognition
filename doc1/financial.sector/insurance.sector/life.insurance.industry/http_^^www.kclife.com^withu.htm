Although "We'll be with you" has been a major theme in Kansas City Life Insurance Company's advertising for more than a decade, it is much more than just a slogan.  The idea behind this statement has been an integral part of our company's investment philosophy since 1895.  This continues to be a driving force in our daily operations today.

<p>
Our commitment again is evident as we provide future financial security for our policyowners and their families.  We do this in the best way we know how...through competitive life insurance products backed by a <a href="kclfmgt.htm">sound investment portfolio</a>.  This enables us to provide basic financial protection to our policyowners at the lowest possible cost.
<p>
As we have said in the past, the promise of financial security is only as good as the company makes it.  I invite you to take a <a href="kclabout.htm">close look at Kansas City Life</a> and our investment practices explained on the following pages.  We stand behind every promise we make with investments that produce the blend of <a href="kclsafe.htm">safety</a>, <a href="kclcash.htm">liquidity </a>and <a href="kclrtns.htm">competitive returns</a> you want.  I think you will see our philosophy is more than just a statement; it is reality.  Remember...
<p>
<h6>We'll be with you.  We're Kansas City Life.</h6>

W.E. Bixby

President

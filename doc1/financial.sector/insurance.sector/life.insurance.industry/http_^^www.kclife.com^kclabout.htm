<p>
The promise of financial security is only as good as the company that makes it.  When Kansas City Life makes a promise, we stand behind it.  Since 1895, we have seen policyowners through world wars, the Great Depression and periods of recession and inflation.  Today is no different.
<p>
Kansas City Life's reputation is built on integrity, sound investment strategies and honest business practices.  To us, integrity is not an outdated notion in today's fast-paced world.  It is the guiding force behind every decision we make.  Every policy we sell is backed by a century of quality service and financial security.

<p>

The wisdom behind our corporate philosophy of protection and safety for policyowners has never been more important.  In today's ever changing economy, you can count on Kansas City Life to be with you now and in the years to come.

A History of Lincoln National's Community Involvement
</font>

<P>
<DL><DD><p>
Since its founding in 1905, social responsibility has been an integral part of Lincoln National's existence.  Shared values -- integrity, responsibility, respect, fairness, diversity, commitment to excellence and employee and agent ownership -- have served as a guide to help make decisions in day-to-day activities.  Lincoln National also incorporates these shared values in its role as a citizen of its community.</P>

<P>
Ian M. Rolland, Chairman and CEO, plays a major role in Lincoln National's corporate citizenship.  His commitment to the community is exemplified in his efforts to improve public education, lead significant community development campaigns, and support initiatives to combat violence among youth.</P>

<P>
Rolland had excellent role models.  His predecessors all were actively involved in community causes, ranging from assisting disadvantaged youth to leading major economic development efforts.  Ian Rolland, and Lincoln National leaders before him, helped make the headquarters city of Fort Wayne a better place to live.</P>

<P>
Today, Lincoln National and its involvement in the community are inseparable.  The vision for the corporation is deeply influenced by its tradition of involvement in communities where it has a strong presence.</P>

<P>
Toward that end, the Lincoln National Foundation, Inc., the charitable giving arm of Lincoln National Corporation, is committed to enhancing the quality of life in those communities where Lincoln National employees live and work.  Lincoln National annually contributes 2 percent of its pre-tax earnings for philanthropic programs of not-for-profit organizations which meet Foundation <A HREF="grant.html">guidelines and requirements.</A>  The Lincoln National Foundation contributes funding in three clearly defined areas of interest:</P>

<UL type=disc>
<LI><A HREF="arts.html">Arts and Culture</A>
<LI><A HREF="educ.lnc.html">Education</A>
<LI><A HREF="human.html">Human Services</A>
</UL>

<P>
A portion of contributions are made directly through Lincoln National Corporation and the Employees Gift Committees make charitable contributions to local organizations representing the interests of LNC employees.</P>

<P>
Realizing Lincoln National's affiliate offices can best determine the needs within their respective communities, the Corporation's affiliate offices operate charitable giving programs separate from the Fort Wayne-based Foundation.</P>

<P>
Lincoln National continues its commitment to the community, as it has throughout its 90-year history, and is considered the leading corporate citizen in Fort Wayne, a leader of corporate citizenship in the State of Indiana and in the U. S. in issues of social consciousness.</P>

<font size="2" face="geneva, arial">
Now more than ever, individuals are keenly interested in saving for their retirement. The percentage of the population reaching middle age is at historic levels. The increasing awareness among Americans about the importance of saving for the future is just one indication of a growing market.
<BR><BR>
As a leading provider of retirement plans, VALIC is well positioned to benefit from these trends. We offer customers the opportunity to save for retirement on a pretax basis and accumulate earnings that are not taxed until withdrawal. We also provide pension plan services, from record keeping to compliance.
<BR><BR>
VALIC sells a wide variety of retirement plans. We help employers provide the right plans for their employees, whether it's a thrift, profit sharing, or simplified employee pension plan. We also offer individual retirement accounts.</FONT>

Our products, services, strong ratings, and outstanding reputation have established VALIC as a leader within our 
markets. We rank number one in the elementary and secondary education markets and number three in the health care and higher education markets.
<BR><BR>
VALIC is a pioneer in the variable annuity business, with more than 40 years of experience. Since 1964, we've focused on the needs of the education and health care markets, and now we're expanding our presence in a complementary market &#151; state and local governments &#151; which shares a similar customer profile.
<BR><BR>
In 1996, participant accounts grew 11% to 1.5 million. This year, the American Hospital Association, with a hospital network of 5,000 institutions  representing four million employees, endorsed VALIC as its exclusive provider. We now hold 23 national endorsements and 36 regional endorsements, strengthening our position as a leader within the education and health care markets.
<BR><BR>
Our financial strength further enhances our market position. Consumers are concerned about the safety of their retirement savings. VALIC has earned the highest ratings for financial strength and claims-paying ability from the nation's leading rating agencies. This financial strength and stability  gives our customers peace of mind.</FONT>

<font size="2" face="geneva, arial">
In addition to being concerned about the safety of their savings, consumers often need help in planning for their retirement. That's why VALIC's distribution system is yet another competitive advantage.
<BR><BR>
Our distribution system delivers personalized retirement planning services for our customers through a highly trained sales force. VALIC's 1,000 retirement plan specialists meet face-to-face with customers to provide individualized retirement planning that is easy and worry-free.
<BR><BR>
This commitment to personalized service helps us chart a steady course of growth and builds VALIC's reputation for excellence within our markets. As a result, annual sales growth has averaged 15% over the past five years.</FONT>

<font size="2" face="geneva, arial">
Our market responsive products are another core strength. VALIC introduced Portfolio Director&reg; 2 during 1996 in response to an explosive demand for mutual fund options.
<BR><BR>
With Portfolio Director 2, we are 
the first company to offer a variable annuity product with publicly available funds to our markets. Of the product's 20 investment options, 12 are publicly traded mutual funds, packaged to better help our clients with their single-most important retirement planning decision &#151; the allocation of assets.
<BR><BR>
Our commitment to technology enhances our service to customers. In 1996, we introduced an electronic application process that has improved operating efficiencies. Additionally, we use state-of-the-art software to facilitate the retirement planning process.
Through the use of Portfolio Optimizer&reg;, a proprietary asset allocation software, our sales representatives can tailor a retirement plan to meet 
the personal savings objectives of our customers.
<BR><BR>
Portfolio Optimizer transforms the complex investment allocation process into a series of simple, easy-to-make decisions.
<BR><BR>
In 1996, the Portfolio Director product series, supported by Portfolio 
Optimizer, accounted for 62% of 
VALIC's premium.</FONT>

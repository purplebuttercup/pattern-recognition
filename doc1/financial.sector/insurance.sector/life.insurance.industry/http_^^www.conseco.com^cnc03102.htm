Carmel, Ind.:  Oct. 29, 1997 -- Conseco, Inc. (NYSE:CNC) today reported third quarter 1997 operating earnings of $152.2 million, or 72 cents per fully diluted share, increases of 91 percent and 44 percent, respectively, over third quarter 1996.  Both figures reached their highest quarterly levels in the company's history.  Operating earnings for the first nine months of 1997 also reached a record $407.9 million, or $1.94 per share, up 124 percent and 44 percent, respectively, over the first nine months of 1996.<P>

(Note to editors:  As used throughout this release, "operating earnings" exclude investment gains (losses), nonrecurring items and extraordinary charges.  "Operating earnings per fully diluted share" is the figure security analysts reference in their published earnings estimates.  According to First Call, the consensus analyst estimate for Conseco's 3Q97 operating earnings per fully diluted share was 70 cents.  All share and per-share data in this release have been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock splits distributed April 1, 1996, and Feb. 11, 1997.)<P>

Conseco Chairman Stephen C. Hilbert said, "These strong results again demonstrate our ability to actively manage profitable internal growth, as well as to seek out, complete and consolidate accretive acquisitions.  We are particularly pleased with the level of new sales in the quarter, which, despite the agent distractions which normally accompany acquisitions, rose by 5 percent overall and showed gains in all but one of our major product segments.  Compared to third quarter 1996, first-year premiums were up 11 percent in our individual and group major medical segment, 7 percent in supplemental health, and 3 percent in annuities.  New business in our life insurance segment declined, as expected, because of our decision to redesign our universal life products in order to meet higher profit standards.  Total collected premiums, including renewals, reached a record $1.36 billion for the quarter and a record $4.03 billion for the nine months of 1997.  And we believe that Conseco Marketing, under President Don Gongaware, is only beginning to tap the potential of our 190,000 agents.  <P>

"Another highlight of the quarter," Hilbert said, "was completing the acquisition of Colonial Penn Life Insurance Co., our 18th acquisition in 15 years as an operating company.  Colonial Penn, with its technologically advanced direct-response marketing arm, is a key strategic addition to the Conseco family of companies.  We plan to take full advantage of Colonial Penn's expertise in television advertising, direct mail, telemarketing and database management to generate leads for our agents and to help them cross-market the full range of Conseco products.<P>

"In the coming quarters," Hilbert said, "our opportunity will be to translate Conseco's enormous product and distribution strength into real value for our shareholders, customers, agents and employees.  To capitalize on this opportunity, we are strengthening our cross-marketing effort with the launch of Conseco brand advertising.  In Phase One of the campaign (mid-October), the new brand and new logo (the Conseco "performance mark") were introduced to Conseco's employee associates.  In Phase Two, which began October 23, we started introducing the Conseco brand in nationwide print ads aimed at increasing awareness of Conseco among current and prospective agents.  Phase Three, to begin in the second quarter of 1998, will include print and broadcast ads designed to increase Conseco's profile and positive perception among consumers.  Our goal is to make it even more productive for our agents to approach their prospects and customers with Conseco products.<P>

"Results for the third quarter," Hilbert said, "keep us on track to equal or exceed the consensus analyst estimate (according to First Call) of $2.71 of operating earnings per share in 1997, an increase of approximately 43 percent over the $1.89 reported in 1996.  As we contemplate our transformation into one of the nation's premier providers of annuities, universal life insurance and supplemental health insurance products, we couldn't be more excited about the future.  Compared to any other time in its history, Conseco today is bigger, financially stronger, more diversified in its earnings sources (which should mean greater earnings stability and predictability), and better positioned to benefit from the growth of several of the industry's most attractive markets.<P>

"Upon completion of the Washington National acquisition (expected in December)," Hilbert said, "Conseco will have approximately $36 billion of assets on its own balance sheet and $8 billion of annual premiums and revenues.  With a debt/capital ratio near our 35 percent target, and more than $800 million of annual EBIT cash flow, we have the balance sheet flexibility we need in order to continue pursuing the most profitable opportunities we can find.<P>

 "We'll continue to rely," Hilbert said, "on the business disciplines that have made Conseco one of America's best-performing public companies over the past decade:  efficient operations, active investment and capital management, high-quality customer service, and a bottom-line focus."<P>

<STRONG>Third quarter results.</STRONG>  Conseco has four primary business segments:  life insurance, annuities, supplemental health and individual and group major medical.  Third quarter operating earnings increased in 1997 primarily as a result of:  (1) the acquisitions of Transport Holdings Inc. (December 1996), American Travellers Corp. (December 1996), Capitol American Financial Corp. (March 1997) and Pioneer Financial Services, Inc. (May 1997); (2) Conseco's purchase of the remaining equity stakes in American Life Holdings, Inc. (September 1996) and Bankers Life Holding Corp. (December 1996); and (3) increased business in force.<P>

<STRONG>Invested Assets.</STRONG>  At Sept. 30, 1997, Conseco's consolidated $24.7 billion investment portfolio consisted primarily of investment-grade, publicly traded debt securities.  Only 1 percent of investments were mortgages, only 5 percent were high-yield bonds, and there were no significant nonperforming investments.<P>

<STRONG>Net income.</STRONG>  Third quarter 1997 net income of $153.8 million, or 73 cents per fully diluted share, also included:  (1) net  investment gains of $42.8 million, or 20 cents per share; (2) an extraordinary charge of $0.7 million, or nil per share, related to early retirement of debt; and (3) nonrecurring charges totaling $40.5 million, or 19 cents per share, related to Conseco's Medicare supplement business in Massachusetts.  The Massachusetts insurance department has been unwilling to approve reasonable rate increases to Medicare supplement providers.  Conseco is discontinuing the sale of new Medicare supplement policies in Massachusetts and in the third quarter wrote down the cost of policies purchased and produced and accrued additional claim reserves related to its inforce Massachusetts Medicare supplement business.  Conseco is appealing the department's rating actions to the supreme court of Massachusetts.  Third quarter 1996 net income of $78.1 million, or 49 cents per share, included: (1) net investment losses of $0.3 million, or nil cents per share; and (2) an extraordinary charge of $1.2 million, or 1 cent per share, related to early retirement of debt.<P>

Nine-month 1997 net income of $395.9 million, or $1.82 per fully diluted share, also included:  (1) net investment gains of $39.0 million, or 18 cents per share; (2) an extraordinary charge of $6.2 million, or 3 cents per share, related to early retirement of debt; (3) a charge of 6 cents per share related to the induced conversion of preferred stock (treated as a preferred stock dividend); and (4) nonrecurring charges totaling $44.8 million, or 21 cents per share, related to the previously discussed third quarter actions on Conseco's Massachusetts Medicare supplement business and to the death of an executive officer in the second quarter.  Nine-month 1996 net income of $174.5 million, or $1.29 per share, included: (1) net investment losses of $6.4 million, or 5 cents per share; (2) nonrecurring income of $17.7 million, or 13 cents per share, resulting from the sale of Conseco's investment in Noble Broadcast Group; and (3) an extraordinary charge of $18.6 million, or 14 cents per share, related to early retirement of debt.<P>

<STRONG>Shares outstanding.</STRONG>  Weighted average shares outstanding (the figure used in calculating fully diluted earnings per share) were 212.1 million for the third quarter of 1997, up 34 percent over third quarter 1996.  Conseco's 1996 and 1997 acquisitions resulted in the issuance of 89.2 million Conseco common and common equivalent shares.  Partially offsetting these issuances, Conseco purchased in the open market a total of 10.0 million of its common shares in the second and third quarters of 1997 (at an average price of $38.77).  There were 188.0 million Conseco common shares issued and outstanding at Sept. 30, 1997.<P>

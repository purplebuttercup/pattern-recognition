<B>Early Intervention</B>

<BR>

Early intervention begins when a claim is reported to our 800 number. The information is sent instantaneously to our local team of medical and claim professionals who begin analysis of the case.

 <BR><BR>

Supported by a state-of-the-art software system that provides expert information on appropriate medical care procedures and return-to-work time frames, the medical and claim management team gets the right professionals involved early in the case.

<BR><BR>

Case management nurses direct all aspects of the return-to-work process, from the medical diagnosis and treatment plan through arranging for appropriate services.

<BR><BR>

The team TravComp 2000 combines the best practices of existing and enhanced Travelers claim and medical disciplines.  Along with improving medical care for injured workers, the program provides a new opportunity to reduce loss costs and speed the delivery of services to our customers and their employees.

<B>Preferred Provider Network</B>

<BR>

	Our preferred provider network is an integral part of TravComp 2000.  With presence in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, Travelers preferred provider network (PPN) system covers 80% of the working population with discounts averaging 26% below fee schedules and reasonable and customary tables. The network adheres to strict credentialing and contracting protocols designed to return the injured worker to gainful employment. It was constructed by medical and claim professionals to treat workers' compensation-specific illnesses and injuries to achieve early return-to-work at the lowest cost.   

<BR><BR>

 Travelers medical management services division uses the following mechanisms to 

encourage injured employees to use the preferred provider network for all treatment 

unless required services aren't available:

<ul>

<li>	Training and orientation to first-line supervisors, employees, and claim staff

<li>	Sending a preferred provider network  introductory letter to employees

<li>	Providing Internet access to the <A HREF="http://www.hccompare.com">network directory</A> 

<li>	Providing employers, claim professionals and providers with local network directories

<li>	Using our 1-800 PPO InfoLine to access referrals

<li>	Training providers to ensure referrals remain in network

</ul>

<BR><BR>

<B>Pharmacy Network</B>

<BR>

Travelers national pharmacy management network is specifically designed for workers' 

compensation so that you pay for the appropriate amount of medicine at a fair unit price. 

A pharmacy card helps the injured employee get necessary drugs quickly.  To reduce 

overuse, misfills, early refills, dangerous drug interactions and payment for unrelated drugs, our 

system compares all drug requests against currently prescribed medications.

<B>Medical Management</B>

<BR>

The medical management process is initiated by the TravComp 2000 team in each local claim office.  Case management nurses use state-of-the-art software medical protocols to effectively control medical payout and indemnity lost time. They make case-by-case decisions based on a vast array of medical information as well as the effect the treatment will have on the return-to-work plan.

<BR><BR>

The nurse works together with the claim case manager and all other involved parties, communicating with both the employer and the injured employee.

<B>Medical Bill Review</B>

<BR>

Travelers reviews all medical bills on the basis of appropriateness, relatedness, fee 

schedule, discounts, and reasonable and customary rates. Our case managers review and 

re-price every bill using Travelers on-line integrated medical bill re-pricing (IMBR), which 

has streamlined the once lengthy process of review, re-pricing and approval to one day. 

IMBR is designed to handle local and state fee schedules, detecting treatments and 

diagnostic codes unrelated to workplace injuries. While the final authority to pay rests 

with case managers, IMBR provides immediate information for allaying the costs of 

improper prescription or treatment plans. The system warns us when special actions such 

as pre-authorizations are required, detecting code manipulation practices including:

<ul>

<li>	Medical visit type edits

<li>	Mutually exclusive procedures

<li>	Incidental procedures

<li>	Single code edits: assistant surgeon

<li>	Pre-post operative edits

<li>	Bi-lateral procedures

<li>	Clinical duplicate procedures

</ul>



All financial values, bills charged, re-priced and paid amounts are stored on the system and 

continually audited. Regular reviews of payments are conducted as part of a quality 

assurance and financial audit perspective. We review all medical bills for:

<ul>

<li>	Fee schedule compliance

<li>	Duplication

<li>	Additional discounts

<li>	Individual service dates

<li>	Diagnosis codes

<li>	Recommended reduction 

<li>	Medical necessity

<li>	PPO savings

<li>	Bill upcoding

</ul>

<B>Return-to-Work Programs</B>

<BR>

Return-to-work programs are the cornerstone of  TravComp 2000.  From the first notice, we evaluate the injury against objective return-to-work and medical guidelines. By applying those guidelines to the work environment, we create the best possible return-to-work plan including a diagnosis review, treatment plan, physician management plan, return-to-work strategy, and determination of need for catastrophic team assistance. Our medical team then works with the treating physician to assist the physician in recognizing return-to-work possibilities.

<BR><BR>

On-site disability management services are arranged if needed due to cooperation issues,

job assessment needs, vocational counseling, or other issues. 

<BR><BR>

For employees whose serious injury precludes the possibility of returning to the same job, 

the process of vocational rehabilitation begins.

<B>A new level of care and cost savings</B>

<BR>

TravComp 2000 offers you a new level of integrated workers' compensation and managed care claim management by teaming our medical and claim professionals in local field offices.

In addition to cost-saving benefits, TravComp 2000 provides a heightened degree of thoroughness, coordination and efficiency that occurs when people work closely together and become familiar with all aspects of the process.  This helps injured workers get the treatment they need for a timely return-to-work.

<BR><BR>

TravComp 2000 is the latest in a series of workers' compensation innovations for Travelers.  In 1975, we were first to install a national comprehensive distribution processing system to pay workers' compensation claims. We introduced the first carrier-owned preferred provider network for workers' compensation in 1990 and the first telephone reporting system for comp a year later.  

<BR><BR>

As we continue into the next century, you can be sure Travelers will continue to apply our years of experience and utilize the latest technology to improve workers' compensation claim results.

Our vision is to enhance  the quality of life of our customers, our stockholders, and our people.<IMG SRC=  "dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>  We hold to three preeminent values - quality, serving people, and growth  - which by tradition and choice transcend all others. They are the foundation  of our aspirations, our plans, our best energies, and our life together  in this Company.</P>  <H3>Quality</H3>  <P>The heart of quality is integrity. Quality is the cornerstone on which  all our activity rests - quality products, services, people, and investments.  We strive for superior quality and continuous quality improvement in everything  we do.</P>  <H3>Serving People</H3>  <P>Serving people is vital. We find our ultimate reward in serving and  supporting three groups:<IMG SRC="dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"   ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>  <STRONG>Customers:</STRONG> Our customers come first. We prosper only to  the extent that we create long-term relationships with satisfied customers.  We do so in discerning their needs and responding to them; in providing  high value, distinctive products; in prudent investment of policyholder  funds; in systems, information, and counsel which help our customers solve  problems; and in prompt, accurate, innovative, and courteous service which  is the best in the business.<BR>  <STRONG>Stockholders:</STRONG> Our stockholders provide the equity essential  for our success. We are stewards of their investment and must return a  profit to them. Profit is essential for implementing our commitment to  quality, serving people, and growth. It is a critical measurement of our  performance. Our objective is to rank at the top of the industry in long-range  earnings growth and return on equity. <STRONG>Protective People:</STRONG>  The accomplishment of our mission depends on all Protective people working  together. We want our people to enjoy their work and take pride in Protective  Life, its mission and values. We are committed to opportunity and training  for all to help us fulfill our potential; open, candid communication; the  input, initiative, and empowerment of all our people; the encouragement  of one another; and creating a place where a zeal to serve our customers,  stockholders, and each other permeates the Company.</P>  <H3>Growth</H3>  <P>We are dedicated to long-term growth in sales, revenues, and profit,  not only for our stockholders but also for personal growth and development  of Protective people. We achieve growth through resourceful marketing,  superior service, and acquisitions. Growth is critical for improving quality  and serving people. It is essential to maintaining a position of strength  in our marketplace and attracting and retaining high caliber people.<IMG SRC=  "dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>  <A HREF="#anchor807774">Return to top of page</A><IMG SRC="dot_clear.gif"  WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="189">&nbsp;</TD><TD><BLOCKQUOTE>  <H2><A NAME="anchor1807386"></A>Five Cardinal Principles For Building Quality</H2>  <P><STRONG>1.</STRONG> Focus on the customer.<IMG SRC="dot_clear.gif"   WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>  <STRONG>2.</STRONG> Continuously improve.<IMG SRC="dot_clear.gif" WIDTH=  "1" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>  <STRONG>3.</STRONG> Equip, empower, and liberate people and trust their  capability and willingness to improve quality.<IMG SRC="dot_clear.gif"  WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>  <STRONG>4.</STRONG> Concentrate on the long term, the whole process, and  the team.<IMG SRC="dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN="BOTTOM"   NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>  <STRONG>5.</STRONG> Use statistical analysis to understand and continuously  improve the process.<IMG SRC="dot_clear.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" ALIGN=  "BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="252">&nbsp;</TD><TD><BLOCKQUOTE>  <H2><A NAME="anchor212916"></A>Our Corporate Symbol <IMG SRC="logo1.gif"  WIDTH="302" HEIGHT="58" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></H2>  <P>Our corporate symbol is the triangle whose shape connotes the strong  foundation which stands beneath Protective's basic mission to provide financial  security through life and health insurance and investment products.

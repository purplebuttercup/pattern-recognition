<h3><b>The Company Behind the Plan</b></h3>
<hr>
The promise of financial security is only as good as the company that makes it.  When Kansas City Life makes a promise, we stand behind it.  Since 1895, we have seen policyowners through world wars, the Great Depression and periods of recession and inflation.  Today is no different.
<p>
Kansas City Life's reputation is built on integrity, sound investment strategies and honest business practices.  To us, integrity is not an outdated notion in today's fast-paced world.  It is the guiding force behind every decision we make.  Every policy we sell is backed by a century of quality service and financial security.

<p>
The wisdom behind our corporate philosophy of protection and safety for policyowners has never been more important.  In today's ever-changing economy, you can count on Kansas City Life to be with you now and in the years to come.

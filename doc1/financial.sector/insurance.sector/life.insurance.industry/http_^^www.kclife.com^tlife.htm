<p>
If you are like most people, you're busy building for the future.  Starting a family, building a home, sending a  child off to college, enjoying a comfortable, worry-free retirement.  Any one or all of these events may be in your future.
<p>
You can't predict the future.  But you can plan for it.  Kansas City Life can help protect you and your family with insurance plans for every age and stage of life – protection for your family, mortgage, business, income, retirement and estate.
<p>
<u><h6>The Importance of Life Insurance</h6></u>
<p>
It's never too early, or too late, to start planning for a brighter tomorrow.  And there's no better place to start than with the Kansas City Life policy you are considering right now.
<p>
Life insurance is the cornerstone to a sound financial plan for you and your family.  When you need protection and permanent insurance is not an option, term insurance is a good alternative.
<p>
<u><h6>The Value of Term Insurance</h6></u>
<p>
Real value is found not only in price, but in policy features that benefit you, the buyer.  With a term policy from Kansas City Life, you can make sure that funds are available for any of the following situations:
<p>
<ul>
<li><i>Replace your income in order to maintain your family's standard of living
<li>Pay final medical and funeral expenses
<li>Settle your estate
<li>Pay debts and other obligations, such as your mortgage
<li>Pay college expenses for your children
<li>Transfer your business
<li>Leave a contribution to your favorite charity</i>
</ul>

<p>
<u><h6>The Coverage You Need Now</h6></u>
<p>
Because of its low cost, term insurance offers an affordable way to cover any financial risk you may have. You pay only for the amount and duration of coverage you need.
<p>
At the time of issue, term policies typically offer the greatest level of protection for the premium dollars available. Because it builds no cash values, term insurance often has been described as "renting" rather than "owning" protection.
<p>
You may renew any Kansas City Life term policy (except Juvenile Term to 22) until age 95 – we will never cancel your coverage as long as required premium payments are made.
<p>
<u><h6>Building a Brighter Future</h6></u>
<p>
As the years go by and families grow, insurance needs change.  While providing needed protection, a term policy from Kansas City Life also insures your ability to purchase permanent coverage in the future, regardless of your health at the time.
<p>
If you choose to convert, you're not limited to only one or two plans.  All Kansas City Life term policies may be converted to any of the outstanding permanent life products we currently offer.
<p>
You may convert at any time as long as your request is made before the final conversion date which varies by issue age and the type of term policy you purchase.

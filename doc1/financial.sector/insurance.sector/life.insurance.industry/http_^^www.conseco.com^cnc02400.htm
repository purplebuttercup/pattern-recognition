<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Quarterly Reporting</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Conseco’s quarterly results announcements, containing all of the financial information typically found in traditional quarterly reports, are available immediately upon their release through Conseco’s Fax-On-Demand service and Web site and via regular mail to those on our mailing list.   <P>

<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Projections</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Conseco will not make regular earnings forecasts, but we reserve the right to make earnings projections when we think it appropriate.  We are most apt to do so when something happens that seems likely to affect results previously expected.  Any projections we make will be soundly based, appropriately qualified, conservative and factual.  We will disseminate any projection widely and update it as needed during the affected period.  We will try to help analysts prepare earnings estimates for the company, particularly by commenting on the assumptions they use to predict our results.<P>

<FONT SIZE=4><STRONG>Disclosure Policy</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Within the framework of the securities laws, Conseco’s policy is to release widely and in a timely fashion to the public all information which would reasonably be expected to materially affect the market value of its securities or influence investors’ decisions.  When company news is released, the company’s primary concern will be to assure that such news is handled in proper perspective.<P>

Conseco’s policy is to maintain an “open door” in its relations with security analysts, financial writers, shareholders, and others who have legitimate interest in the company’s affairs.  Information will be provided to such people, either in groups or individually, through the distribution of news releases, annual reports, and other corporate communications, including face-to-face meetings with shareholders, security analysts and the news media.  Reasonable questions will also be answered from investors, within the limits of confidentiality and proper disclosure policy.  For example, only general information on the performance of individual subsidiaries will be provided.  Information will not be given out to one inquirer which would not be given to another, nor will information be revealed that would not be presented willingly to the news media.<P>

<TD WIDTH="62%" VALIGN="TOP"><P>Your company has goals...achievements it intends to attain. And to reach
those goals, your company has a plan...a comprehensive and strategic plan
addressing your business objectives and operations.</P>

<P>Your benefits plan...including a dental plan...is an important part of
the overall plan...because charting a true course for the health, well-being
and satisfaction of employees contributes significantly to your company's
ability to meet its goals.</P>

<P>The United Dental Care companies offer a wide array of dental plans that
meet your company's needs...and the needs of your employees. Beyond our
comprehensive selection of dental benefits, we deliver service that is unrivaled
in the industry.</P>

<P>Today, with so many healthcare choices available to you, your decision
ultimately rests on service...on the difference between being a client or
being a valued client.</P>

<P>We believe in being part of your team, building a valued relationship
that you can rely on and trust. That is why our Account Managers are based
in your community...to deliver prompt, responsive and personal service.
Their commitment is to you - to make your job easier, your employees happier
and the return on your benefits dollar a sound investment.</P>

<P>We are committed to representing your interests as an employer. By understanding
your needs, we design our plans to meet them. We provide dental HMO plans,
as well as dual choice and point-of-service coverage for employers that
wish to offer both dental HMO and indemnity insurance to their employees.
Through our National Plan, we provide uniform, comprehensive coverage for
employers with multi-state work forces.</P>

<P>The United Dental Care Companies provide the dental HMO plans of choice
for major employers, mid-sized companies and small businesses across America...because
our commitment to service focuses on your satisfaction.</P>

<P>In annual surveys, our employer groups tell us that their satisfaction
with The United Dental Care companies is due to:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Easy administration of dental benefits
  <LI>Voluntary plans requiring no employer contribution

  inquiries to the companies' benefits managers, but also encourages wellness

</UL>

<P>We understand that your responsibility in selecting a dental plan is
two-fold: You must meet your company's objectives, while being assured that
employees will value their dental benefits.</P>

<P>Our periodic member surveys produce consistently high marks in satisfaction
from hundreds of thousands of members across America. Members value their
benefits with our plans because:</P>

<UL>

  for adults and children

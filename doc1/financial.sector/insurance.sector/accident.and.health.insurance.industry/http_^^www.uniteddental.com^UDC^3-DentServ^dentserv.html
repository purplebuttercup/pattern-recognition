<TD WIDTH="65%"><P>United Dental Care believes that the single most important consideration
of its delivery system is quality dental care. The keys to quality dental
care include convenient dentist locations, and the availability of a wide
selection of private practice dentists committed to establishing a positive
patient/dentist relationship.</P>

<P>And the results are outstanding.</P>

<P>All participating Family Dentists and Specialists are subject to a credentialing
process to ensure their qualifications meet our high standards. United Dental
Care:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Performs background checks with both the State Board of Dental Examiners
  and malpractice insurance carriers,
  <LI>Validates proof of professional liability insurance, and
  <LI>Ensures our commitment to care for our members with the same standards
  and compassion they provide to all their patients.
</UL>

<P>Our experienced provider relations staff goes to great lengths to carefully
measure all elements of a dental practice, including:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>The overall attitude and demeanor of the office staff;
  <LI>The accessibility, including parking, waiting room, and appointment
  availability;
  <LI>Offices that are clean and dental equipment that is state-of-the-art;
  and
  <LI>Patient recall systems that encourage preventive dental care.
</UL>

<P>United Dental Care's Quality Assessment Plan establishes rigorous, ongoing,
monitoring of each dental practice.</P>

<P>The Quality Assessment Committee, chaired by the Dental Director, issues
quarterly reports to United Dental Care's Senior Management that include
recommendations regarding specific dentist performance issues:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>General utilization data collected from each network dentist,
  <LI>Member satisfaction and quality of care measured through periodic surveys,
  <LI>Volume of emergency visits analyzed for appropriateness.
  <LI>Provisions for emergency treatment, 7 days a week, 24 hours a day,
  <LI>Routine appointments generally available within 4-6 weeks,
  <LI>Family Dentists with office hours at least 3 days per week,
  <LI>Multilingual and after-hours capabilities by some Family Dentists.
  <LI>Evaluation of dentist compliance with United Dental Care's service
  standards,
  <LI>Provider chart audits examining member treatment plans and reviewing
  documentation related to treatment rendered,
  <LI>Recommendations pertaining to a specific provider's performance, and
  <LI>Suggestions for improving United Dental Care's policies and procedures
  to enhance quality of care.
</UL>

<P>Admittedly, few patients ever scrutinize a dental provider the way we
do. That is why you can rest assured that you and your employees are in
good company with United Dental Care.</TD></TR>

<TD WIDTH="65%"><P>The companies you serve have goals...achievements they intend to attain.
And to reach those goals, your clients have a plan that addresses their
business objectives and operations.</P>

<P>The dental HMO plans you recommend become an important part of your clients'
overall plans...because keeping pace in a competitive world today depends
on the health, well-being and satisfaction of employees.</P>

<P>And, for you, keeping pace in a competitive world means having not only
the best plans to offer your clients...but the assurance that the plan will
serve both your clients' interests as well as your own.</P>

<P>The United Dental Care companies offer dental HMO plans that meet your
needs...for the comprehensive and competitive dental benefits you can recommend

<P>We believe in being part of your team, building a valued relationship
that you can rely on and trust. Our Account Executives are based in your
community...to deliver prompt, responsive and turnkey service, from managing
your clients' open enrollments to maintaining client service through local
Account Managers. Our commitment is to you. We make your job easier, by
providing you materials and support that make our plans easy to sell. Our
goal is to keep your clients happier, and to assure the return on their
benefits dollar is a sound investment.</P>

<P>We are committed to representing your interests as an agent/broker, and
to rewarding your hard work through competitive commissions that are accurate

HMO and indemnity insurance to their employees. Through our National Plan,
we provide uniform, comprehensive coverage for employers with multi-state
work forces.</P>

for insurance professionals serving major employers, mid-sized companies
and small businesses across America...because our commitment to service
focuses on you and your clients' satisfaction.</P>

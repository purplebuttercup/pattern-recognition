Aetna International Funds give investors access to professionally and expertly managed equity and fixed income funds from the world's major developed and emerging economies.
<P>
Aetna International Funds comprise two Luxembourg umbrella funds - the Aetna International Umbrella Fund and the Aetna Master Fund.  Funds under management collectively currently stand at US $400 million.
<P>
Our strategy is to offer a broad range of funds on a global basis which provide investors with attractive investment opportunities, within carefully established investment guidelines and objectives.
<P>
Through a detailed screening process which is co-ordinated from our UK office in London, Aetna International Funds' investment team selects specialist investment houses for each of the 31 funds offered. The aim is always to appoint local fund managers, with local expertise, who demonstrate a clear investment process and philosophy, together with a proven long term track record.
<P>
The Investment Committee continually monitors the performance of the current fund range and identifies new products and markets which we believe will benefit our investors.
<P>
Investors can currently choose from a selection of 31 funds including specialist equity - for example, Emerging Asia, Emerging Europe and Latin American, regional equity - for example Asian Equity and UK Equity, single country equity - for example French National Equity, fixed income and reserve funds.
<P>
This comprehensive choice of funds can help investors achieve a spectrum of investment aims - from capital preservation and liquidity to long term capital growth via mainstream equity funds, to more speculative investments in emerging markets.
<P>
All the funds are domiciled in Luxembourg and regulated by the Institut Monetaire Luxembourgeois.

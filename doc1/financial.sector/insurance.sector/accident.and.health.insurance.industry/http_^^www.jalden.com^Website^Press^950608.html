<P><B>John Alden Restructures Healthcare Segment</B></P>

<P>MIAMI, FL, June 8, 1995--John Alden Financial Corp. (NYSE:JA) announced
today that it has restructured its HealthCare segment in order to better
focus its resources on product development and accelerate establishment
of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) in select markets.</P>

<P>Within the new structure, the development and management of idemnity
and managed idemnity products will be distinct from HMO products.</P>

<P>John Alden Health Plans Inc. has been established to develop and manage
HMOs in targeted markets. Currently, John Alden is participating in the
Neighborhood Health Partnership, a joint venture HMO in South Florida,
and has established an HMO in Las Vegas. An application for an HMO license
has been filed in Ohio, and the company plans to file in North Carolina
by the end of the 1995 second quarter. Additionally, other locations are
under consideration for future development. John Alden will continue to
pursue growth in its national market and its local markets, while incorporating
more intensive managed care strategies to control utilization. The shift
from national to state-driven reform should provide opportunities to expand
the company's indemnity and managed indemnity business.</P>

<P>&quot;The initial assumptions on which we based our marketing strategies
have been validated,&quot; said Glendon Johnson, president, chairman and
chief executive officer. &quot;We have not altered our strategic direction,
but have identified those areas where we feel the greatest opportunity
for expansion exists. Market conditions, competition and the state of healthcare
reform demonstrate that a successful managed care strategy will play a
key role in our current and future success. We continue to grow our managed
indemnity business, while incorporating additional managed care components
into its administration. We have also accelerated our HMO establishment
in our targeted markets.&quot;</P>

<P>Joseph Radigan continues as senior vice president of National HealthCare.</P>

<P>He is responsible for overseeing the operations of the company's indemnity
and managed indemnity business. William Mauk, who serves as senior vice
president of the company and CEO of the Neighborhood Health Partnership,
has been named president of John Alden Health Plans Inc. He assumes responsibility
for all of John Alden's HMO development and management. Gary Kadlec continues
as president of North Star Marketing Corporation and has been promoted
to Senior Vice President of Group Sales and Marketing and Chief Marketing
Officer for John Alden Life Insurance Company. He will have responsibility
for product marketing and market share development for indemnity, managed
indemnity and HMO business.</P>

<P>The company's HealthCare Risk Management Division will continue to be
led by W. James Tillett, president of Alden Risk Management Services.</P>

<P>John Alden Financial Corporation is an insurance holding company that,
through its subsidiaries, is principally engaged in providing group life
and health insurance and mangaged care services. John Alden is one of the
largest providers of group insurance in this market. The company also markets
annuities, life insurance to individuals, credit life and health insurance,
extended service contracts and other health-related risk management services

<H3>Tips on using the Provider Roster Search Tool</H3>
<TABLE WIDTH=92%><tr><td>
The way to get the best results from the provider search is to start on a general level and get more specific depending on the exact information that you know.<p>

For example, if you are looking for Dr. Smith, you can start by doing a search on the last name &quot;Smith,&quot; but the search will return a very large list of providers.  Instead, try to search for a Smith in a certain area.  By focusing your search to include the county and the state in which  the doctor practices, you can drastically reduce the number of  providers returned by the search.<p>

Each additional piece of information that you include in the search will narrow down the return list, however, if you are not certain of any of the pieces of information, the search may not return the information you need.<p>

<b>Helpful Hints</b><ul>
<li>If you are not positive of the specialty of the provider you are searching for, leave the &quot;Type of Practice&quot; section blank. If you enter the wrong information, the search will not find the provider you are looking for.<p>

<li>If you are unsure of the city in which the Provider you are searching for practices, leave that section blank.  You can narrow your search by providing the state.<p>

<li>When searching for a provider in Manhattan, please refer to the city as &quot;New York,&quot; not &quot;Manhattan.&quot;<p>

<li>A Primary Care Physician (PCP) must be selected from the following specialties:<ul><p>
<li>Family Practice
<li>Geriatric Medicine
<li>Internal Medicine
<li>Pediatrics
<li>Obstetrics / Gynecology
<li>Gynecology
</ul><p>
Please search under one of these specialties when looking for a PCP.</ul>

<h3 align=center><font color="#0000FF">The following has been reproduced in its entirety<br>
from the BEST'S RATING CHANGES article<br>
in the May 27, 1997 issue of B<font size=2>EST</font>W<font size=2>EEK</font> - P/C.</font></h3>
<h4><font size=4><b>Transatlantic Holdings Inc. Group,</b></font><b> </b>New York, had its Best's Rating raised from 
&quot;A+&quot; (Superior) to &quot;A++&quot;. The rating applies to the group's two-member pool, led by 
Transatlantic Reinsurance Co. The rating reflects the group's superior operating 
performance, strong capitalization, and leading position in the broker reinsurance markets.</h4>
<h4>These positive rating factors are derived from the group's recognized specialty risk 
underwriting expertise, well-established and growing global franchise and long-standing 
strategic relationship with American International Group (AIG). In addition, the group 
maintains competitive advantages in terms of its lower expense structure, diversified 
product offering, substantial line capacity and its access to AIG&#146;s vast global market 
network.</h4>
<h4>Despite significant market competition and stable premium production in its domestic 
book, Transatlantic continues to experience market momentum by capitalizing on 
international market opportunities, demonstrating the group&#146;s tremendous operating 
flexibility and ability to sustain consistently favorable earnings trends. Finally, the parent 
holding company is debt free, providing substantial financial flexibility to support the 
group's controlled growth strategies.</h4>
<h4>Offsetting these strengths is Transatlantic's above-average underwriting leverage position. 
This concern, however, is mitigated by the group's higher proportion of loss-sensitive 
business, consistently favorable loss-reserve development and absence of meaningful 
exposure to asbestos and environmental liabilities.</h4>
<h4>Since 1992, the group's pretax return on revenue has been outstanding at 14%, 
outperforming its peers by four points. Transatlantic's exceptional earnings are derived 
from the group's disciplined underwriting approach, low overhead costs and highly 
diversified reinsurance book, which have fostered strong capital generation to support its 
growing book of business. Transatlantic's rating outlook is stable, reflecting its sustainable 
competitive advantages and ability to further capitalize on flight to quality trends in the 
global reinsurance marketplace.</h4>

        ability to increase premiums, appropriately control
        medical costs increases, integrate successfully
        acquisitions it makes (including the merger with U.S.
        Healthcare), increase healthcare membership, and adverse
        changes in regulation. For a discussion of these and
        other important factors, please see Aetna&#146;s 1996
        Form 10-K and 1996 Annual Report to Shareholders. Also,
        certain pro forma information is included herein
        regarding Aetna U.S. Healthcare. Such information is not
        necessarily indicative of the results of operations of
        Aetna U.S. Healthcare had the merger occurred at the
        beginning of 1996, nor is it necessarily indicative of

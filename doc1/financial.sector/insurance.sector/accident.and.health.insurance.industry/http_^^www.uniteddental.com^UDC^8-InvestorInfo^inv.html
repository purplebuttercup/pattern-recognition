<TD WIDTH="65%" VALIGN="TOP"><P>Giving added momentum to our already strong performance is the fact that
the dental benefits industry operates in an environment that is conducive
to continued rapid growth:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Dental spending nationally is robust, growing at a rate far in excess
  of the Consumer Price Index for all goods (the office of National Health
  Statistics estimated a 7.8% increase in dental spending in 1995).
  <LI>Dental coverage is a highly valued benefit by employees.
  <LI>Over one-half of the U.S. population has no dental benefits coverage.
  <LI>Within the portion of the population that has dental benefits, the
  predominant form of coverage is an indemnity product. These products generally
  have little or no incentive to promote dental wellness or manage costs.
  <LI>It is widely acknowledged by clinicians that dental health can be significantly
  improved through preventive measures.
  <LI>There is a growing awareness among dentists that accepting a population
  of managed patients as part of a well-run practice provides solid, predictable
  cashflow, and also represents an opportunity to grow or leverage the practice
  substantially.
</UL>

<P>In short, the market characteristics are favorable for continued strong
growth of dental HMO products. The companies that execute well within this
industry will thrive, and United Dental Care is well-positioned to differentiate
itself in the eyes of its customers.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#400040">John Alden sailed on the Mayflower in 1620 during
its voyage from England to America. At age 20, John was the youngest man
to sign the Mayflower Compact, which was drafted during the journey.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#400040">While aboard the Mayflower, John Alden met Priscilla
Mullins. According to Longfellow’s poem, &quot;The Courtship of Miles Standish,&quot;
Captain Miles Standish, John’s close friend, courted Priscilla through
John. John was willing to do almost anything for his good friend, but there
was one problem -- John Alden also loved Priscilla Mullins.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#400040">Longfellow describes the chain of events that
led to his poem’s most famous line, &quot;Speak for yourself, John.&quot;
This was Priscilla’s response when John tried to push his own feelings
aside to tell her Miles wanted her hand in marriage.</FONT></P>

<P><IMG SRC="Images/ahome.jpg" ALT="Picture of John and Priscilla's Home" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 HEIGHT=199 WIDTH=174 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#400040">Although
the poem possibly mixes fact with fiction, John and Priscilla did marry
in 1622. They settled in Duxbury, Massachusetts, where they prospered and
had 11 children. John became a colony leader, serving as deputy governor,
arbiter and a member of the governor’s council. He was assistant to the
governor a majority of the time from 1631 until about 1687. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#400040">John and Priscilla remained happily married for
60 years, until Priscilla’s death at age 80. John, who lived longer than
any other signer of the Mayflower Compact, died in 1687 at age 88.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#400040">Ironically, the Alden and Standish families were
united through the marriage of John and Priscilla’s daughter Sarah to Miles’
son Alexander.</FONT></P>

<P>Members of the John Alden family lived in the Alden house until 1907.
Today the house is a museum that has been restored and maintained by a
group called the John Alden Kindred. The house is said to be the last remaining
structure built by the Pilgrims.</P>

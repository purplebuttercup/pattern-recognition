<b>COLUMBIA, S.C., Dec. 3, 1997:</b> Policy Management Systems
Corporation(R) (NYSE: PMS; PMSC(R)) announced today that it is the world's
first global insurance and financial services software provider to have all of
its products and services certified by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), a Geneva, Switzerland-based federation dedicated to
helping organizations improve the quality of their products and services.
This certification covers facilities in North and South America, Europe,
Australia, Africa and Asia.
<p>
ISO stresses the importance of internal audits to ensure that an
organization complies with documented procedures and that plans are in place
to promote continued quality improvement.  With the recent ISO certification
of PMSC facilities in the United Kingdom and Germany, all of the company's
worldwide locations are covered under 11 different certificate sites.
Jay T. Deragon, executive director of the Nashville, Tenn.-based Quality
Insurance Congress, said, ``This achievement is a significant step towards
never-ending improvement, and PMSC should be applauded for its leadership
and commitment to quality.''
<p>
G. Larry Wilson, PMSC's president and chief executive officer, said, ``We
are proud to be the first software provider for the insurance and financial
services industries to have all of its facilities ISO certified. We set a
goal earlier this year to have our entire company certified by year-end, and
we've achieved that goal. This shows that our commitment to quality is part of
our corporate culture throughout the world. We continue to invest heavily in
our commitment to quality through additional resources and a variety of
programs. This investment will reduce costs and improve productivity for our
customers and for us.''

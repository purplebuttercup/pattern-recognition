<b>FRONTIER ADJUSTERS OF AMERICA INCOME DECLINES AS REVENUES RISE IN FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR OF FISCAL 1997</b><p>

PHOENIX, Ariz., August 22, 1997 - Frontier Adjusters of America, Inc. (ASE-FAJ), a nationwide franchisor and licensor of claims adjusters, had higher revenues but lower net income in the fourth quarter and 12 months of its 1997 fiscal year, William J. Rocke, chairman and chief executive officer, reported.  The profits decline was primarily due to a large sum paid by Frontier to settle a legal claim.<p>

For the three months ended June 30, 1997, revenues were $1,510,114, up from $1,484,354 one year earlier and net income was $41,951, or one cent per share, compared with $297,942, or seven cents per share.  For the prior 12 months, revenues were $6,164,603, up from $5,641,984, and net income was $979,198, or 21 cents per share, compared with $1,134,519, or 25 cents per share, in fiscal 1996.  Gross billings of franchisees and licensees increased to $48,060,000 in fiscal 1997 from $46,830,000 in the previous fiscal year.<p>

"Frontier's moderate fourth quarter gain in revenues," Mr. Rocke said, "was more than offset by the extraordinary pretax expense of $525,000 paid in settlement of a lawsuit related to alleged embezzlement of more than $700,000 by a former franchisee.  As a result of this outlay, together with higher expenses to strengthen management and staff, income was reduced sharply in both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year."<p>

Frontier Adjusters of America, Inc. licenses and franchises independent claims adjusters throughout North America, with more than 650 advertised locations in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Canada.  The company also owns and operates independent insurance adjusting businesses in Arizona and Nevada.<p>

<P>During the third quarter of 1997, HRI signed 3 additional contracts with existing 
clients, accounting for a total of 3.1 million lives not previously subject to HRI's 
services. Internal growth from existing clients added another 400,000 lives during 
the quarter. On a cumulative basis, lives sold grew by 9.2 million over the comparable 
quarter last year, a 32% increase, and by 3.5 million over the prior quarter, a 10% 
increase. </P>

<P>Installed lives grew by 7.2 million over the comparable quarter last year, a 27% 
increase, and 1.6 million over the prior quarter, a 5% increase. These increases 
represent additional client populations subject to HRI's customary recovery services 
as the result of the successful completion of electronic data interfaces with new 
clients, internal growth of client populations under existing contracts, and the 
contractual expansion of HRI's relationships with existing clients. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>(1) Backlog (i.e., gross recoveries in process) is the total 
dollar amount of potentially recoverable claims pursued on behalf of clients 
at the end of the period.<BR>
(2) Excludes $8.2 million of recoveries and $1.04 million in revenues from the 
silicone breast implant settlement in 1996. <BR>
(3) Equals recoveries for the period divided by the average of backlog at the
beginning and end of the period. </FONT></P>

<P>Backlog for the quarter grew 22% over the comparable quarter and 7.1% over 
the prior quarter. This growth in backlog was the result of the installation 
of new lives and the processing of lives already installed.</P>

<P>Statements in this release that look forward in time involve risks and 
uncertainties, including the ability of HRI to successfully implement its 
operating strategy and acquisition strategy, HRI's ability to manage growth, 
changes in laws and government regulations applicable to HRI, and changes 
in the historical relationships among such key operating indicators as lives 
sold, lives installed, backlog and throughput and in the predictive value of 
these indicators with respect to certain aspects of HRI's financial results. </P>

<P>HRI is a leading provider of health insurance subrogation and related 
recovery services for private healthcare payors.</P>

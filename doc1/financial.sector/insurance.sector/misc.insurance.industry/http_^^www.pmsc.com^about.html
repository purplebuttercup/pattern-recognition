<B>From the beginning,</B></FONT> Policy Management Systems
Corporation<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>&reg;</FONT></SUP>'s story has been one of people working together—business
partners solving problems. When a team of seven developed the first policy
management system in 1974, it was in direct response to the processing
needs of an insurance company. In fact, our Chairman and CEO, G. Larry
Wilson, led the development of that innovative system. This team's breakthrough
established a solid foundation for PMSC<SUP>&reg;</SUP>'s growth into a global provider
of solutions for the insurance and financial services industries.<BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Today,our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PMS,
and our annual revenue exceeds half a billion dollars. We have nearly 5,000
employees worldwide who serve a growing list of customers in the U.S. and
abroad.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Our staff of professionals, with backgrounds in insurance and information
technology, enables us to be one of the largest providers of insurance
solutions in the world.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Many of our employees hold professional designations
such as CPCU, FLMI, FSA, INS, CLU, and ChFC, and we recognize continuing
training and education as a vital component of our success. We have extensive
experience in operating major data centers. With facilities located in
the U.S., Europe, and Australia, we annually process more than seven million
policies with combined premiums of nearly six billion dollars.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our solutions,
in conjunction with our outsourcing options, are designed to enhance customer
service, productivity, and profitability. To us, that's the difference
between a software vendor and a true business partner.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Please take a moment
to learn more about us. We're here to help you realize the benefits of automation — benefits that provide your business with real, competitive advantages.
We know your industry, and we hope to become your business partner. </P>

Marsh and Donald R. McLennan have envisionedthe organization Marsh&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;McLennan Companies has become today. What began in 1871 as asmall fire insurance agency in Chicago has grown into a global professional services firm servingthe complex needs of corporate, institutional and individual clients in more than 100 countries.<P>The early history of Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies parallels the lives of its founders. Althoughthey were men of vastly different temperaments, Henry Marsh, the bold trailblazer, and DonaldMcLennan, the consummate professional, were committed to building an enduring insurancebroking organization and client relationships. When they joined forces, they began to changeAmerica's understanding of the role of the insurance broker and to crystallize the idea of riskmanagement. Observed Henry Marsh, "The problem isn't insurance, it is risk."<P>Yet Mr. Marsh and Mr. McLennan are only the beginning of our Company's story. Othervisionary founders of our businesses include Guy Carpenter, William M. Mercer and GeorgePutnam, among many others. Building on an insurance services core, they developed an array ofsophisticated professional services for clients. Their contributions, and those of our peoplearound the world, have combined to form the vibrant organization Marsh&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;McLennanCompanies is today.<P></TR></TABLE></DIR><!--END MAIN BODY TABLE--><P><!--BEGIN MAIN BODY TABLE--><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="540"><TR>	<TD WIDTH="80"><BR></TD>	<TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="460"><A HREF="../mmc.html"><IMG SRC="../images/logo.gif" ALT="Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Logo" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="81" HEIGHT="43" HSPACE="40" BORDER="0"></A></TD></TR></TABLE><!--END MAIN BODY TABLE--></BODY><MAP NAME="nav_perf">	<AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="4,12,66,56" HREF="../about/index.html">	<AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="75,15,130,55" HREF="../news/index.html">	<AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="139,15,190,56" HREF="../news/finfacts/index.html">	<AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="267,16,323,55" HREF="../view/index.html">	<AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="330,17,382,55" HREF="../mmc.html"></MAP></HTML>

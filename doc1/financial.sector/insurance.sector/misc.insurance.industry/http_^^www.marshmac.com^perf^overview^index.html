Over this 34-yearperiod, both revenue and net income had a compound annual growth rate of 14 percent, whileboth earnings per share and dividends per share grew at a compound annual rate of 12 percent.Our annual return on equity averaged 31 percent.<P>     A $100 investment in Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies in 1962 with dividendsreinvested would have been worth over $14,000 at the end of 1996. This represents a compound annualtotal return to stockholders of 16 percent, exceeding the total return of the overall market asrepresented by the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index. Since 1962, Marsh &amp; McLennan has paidout 57 percent of its earnings to its stockholders in the form of dividends. This represents anaverage dividend yield over this period of 4 percent. In addition, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companieshas increased the total annual dividends paid to shareholders in every year since the companywent public.<P>     Employees, who now number over 36,000 compared with 3,400 in 1962, are not only key tobusiness growth but partners in the Company through their broad-based shareholdings. Some 80percent of our eligible employees in the United States participate in the Stock Investment Plan.<P>     Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies has withstood the test of time in meeting clients' needsduring periods of challenging and rapidly changing market conditions. Looking ahead, all ourbusinesses and employees are committed to quality, poised for continued growth and wellpositioned to further the Company's reputation as the leading professional services firm.<P><NOBR>    <CENTER>    <A HREF="../index.html">Performance Over Time</A> | 	<A HREF="../timeline/index.html">Milestones</A> | 	<A HREF="../per_form.html">Request Information</A>	</CENTER><P></NOBR></TD></TR></TABLE><!--END MAIN BODY TABLE--><P><!--BEGIN MAIN BODY TABLE--><!--<TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="540"><TR>	<TD WIDTH="80"><BR></TD>	<TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="460"><IMG SRC="../../images/logo.gif" ALT="Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Logo" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="81" HEIGHT="43" HSPACE="40" BORDER="0"></TD></TR></TABLE>--><!--END MAIN BODY TABLE--></BODY><MAP NAME="nav_perf">	<AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="4,12,66,56" HREF="../../about/index.html">	<AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="75,15,130,55" HREF="../../news/index.html">	<AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="139,15,190,56" HREF="../../news/finfacts/index.html">	<AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="200,15,262,55" HREF="../index.html">	<AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="267,16,323,55" HREF="../../view/index.html">	<AREA SHAPE="rect" COORDS="330,17,382,55" HREF="../../mmc.html"></MAP></HTML>

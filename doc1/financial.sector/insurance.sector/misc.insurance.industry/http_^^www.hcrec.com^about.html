<P>Subrogation is a contractual right held by health care payors to recover
medical expense dollars when one of their plan participants is injured,
and the injury is the liability of another party.</P>

<P>The term subrogation is not the only one used to describe the activity
of recovering the medical costs of accidents. Depending upon state or federal
ERISA laws, available coverages and the plan's language, a recovery program
could be called subrogation, right of reimbursement or third party liability.</P>

<P>HRI has the expertise to utilize all available policy provisions and
to recover your paid medicals from a variety of sources, including:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Homeowner's Liability
  <LI>Product Liability
  <LI>No-fault Medical Coverage
  <LI>Auto Coverage
  <LI>Commercial Premises Liability
  <LI>Services Liability
  <LI>Workers' Compensation
  <LI>Auto No-fault
</UL>

<P>Self-insured employer groups, including those with employees in multiples
states, are allowed to subrogate their claims expenses regardless of individual
state subrogation laws. This is allowed due to the ERISA preemption, which
was tested and stood under the scrutiny of a Supreme Court ruling.</P>

<P>HRI offers three types of recovery services:</P>

<P><B>Ongoing Recovery Services</B> - HRI will provide comprehensive recovery
services for your employees from the date of agreement forward.</P>

<P><B>Retrospective Review</B> - In a retrospective review project, HRI
will investigate accident-related claims which have been paid in a prior
one or two year period. The goal of a retrospective review is to find and
recover accident files which were previously missed. The result of the Review
is &quot;found money&quot; for the employer.</P>

<P><B>Pending Files</B> - HRI can assume responsibility for all pending
files currently under recovery by the employer or its administrator. This
service allows the employer to immediately centralize all subrogation activity
with HRI.</P>

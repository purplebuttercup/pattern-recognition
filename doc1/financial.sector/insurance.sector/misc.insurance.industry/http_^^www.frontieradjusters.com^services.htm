<b>Professional Multi-line Claims Services</b>
<p>
Frontier and/or its owner-operator franchisees and licensees provide the full range of claims adjusting services to insurance companies, self-insureds, municipalities, general agents, brokers, captive insurers, and others.  Frontier’s owner-operators are affiliated with Frontier on an exclusive basis and have an average of 21 years of multi-line claims experience.  There are over 650 advertised Frontier locations in all 50 states and Canada.  
<p>
Frontier’s adjusters bring both their experience and high level of professionalism and dependability to all their assignments.  Service is provided for all lines of coverage, from routine personal and commercial lines to complex environmental claims; for all intensities of claims handling, from the taking of a single statement to full claims administration and special investigations; and from single claim assignments to complete catastrophic events services.  
<p>
Frontier’s independent owner-operators report directly to the client, avoiding multiple layers of home office charges.  They also bill clients directly for their services without the addition of home office charges.  The extensive geographic coverage of Frontier’s network of offices also contributes to client savings because the need for extensive travel time to handle claims is often reduced.
<p>
Clients make assignments directly to the location they select from the <a href="http://sql.primenet.com/frontier/search.asp">Frontier Directory</a>, or Frontier's home office in Phoenix (fax: 800-553-4799; voice: 800-528-1187 ) will accept assignments and re-assign them to appropriate Frontier offices in the United States or Canada.
<p>
<b><a name="hotline">Truck Loss Hotline</a></b>
<p>
Frontier operates a nationwide truck loss hotline, which is answered 24-hours a day by Frontier’s own home office staff.  Adjusters maintain 24-hour telephone and/or beeper service to make themselves available for this program.  Trucking companies (or their insurers) experiencing a loss anywhere in North America can call 1-800-426-7228 at any time of the day or night.  The client will receive a prompt call-back from an experienced adjuster in the geographic area of the loss.  The loss will then be handled in accordance with the client's direct instructions to the adjuster on the scene.

Willis Corroon Group is one of the world's largest insurance 
and reinsurance brokers.  It can trace its origins in the United 
Kingdom to the 1820s, and in the United States to 1905.  Ever since
those early years its goal has been the same--to meet clients' needs 
in the management of risk to the highest attainable standard.

<p>

The Group's head office is in London at Ten Trinity Square and, in the 
USA, the principal office is located in Nashville, Tennessee.  There are 
Group offices in all the major continental European 
capitals.  The Group is represented in 74 countries 
and some 260 offices by more than 11,000 staff.

<p>

In 1996 the Group handled 
gross premiums of some £7 
billion, nearly $11 billion at the 1996 year-end 
rate of exchange.  Operating
revenue of £725 million ($1.24 billion) produced profits before
tax of £91.6 million ($156.6 million).

<p>

The shares of Willis Corroon Group are listed on the 
London, New York and Pacific Stock 
Exchanges.

<P>At HRI, recoveries are made every day based on the facts of an accident.
But, when an HRI examiner is faced with a case which demands a high level
of technical expertise as well as their ability to understand the emotional
aspects of a case, a real difference is evident in the recovery.</P>

<P>In difficult negotiations, HRI examiners must remain sensitive to the
clients' injured members while, at the same time, protecting the recovery
interests of the health care payor. The resolution of a recent case epitomizes
HRI's willingness to work with the member -- and it established a benchmark
to measure HRI's commitment to serving its clients fully.</P>

<P>HRI identified an accident file involving a teenage girl who was injured
while riding as a passenger in her boyfriend's car. Following a complete
investigation, HRI's examiner presented a consolidated statement of benefits
to the liability carrier.</P>

<P>When there was no timely response, the examiner personally contacted
the liability carrier to request reimbursement. In the course of the negotiations,
the examiner discovered the member's family had not filed a claim on the
accident. The attorney for the carrier explained that the member's religious
beliefs prevented her from filing a personal injury claim against the boyfriend's
policy.</P>

<P>Seeking to further understand the situation, the examiner asked the member
to consider filing a claim for reimbursement of medical bills only -- one
which would not pursue pain and suffering. This approach would transfer
the expense from the healthcare payor to the correct insurer, the liability
carrier. When presented with this option, the member's family agreed the
health plan was entitled to reimbursement for the medical bills and a claim
was initiated.</P>

<P>At this point, it would be logical to assume that the case was resolved.
However, the examiner's experience indicated that continued monitoring of
this case was needed.</P>

<P>In periodic follow-up with the liability carrier, the examiner learned
the member required future medical care relating to injuries received in
the accident. Unfortunately, the member's insurance was in jeopardy due
to a pending loss of employment. Another solution was needed to provide
the necessary medical care and to protect the health plan from future medical
expenses. The examiner recommended development of a settlement agreement
to cover the member's anticipated medical care.</P>

<P>Attorneys for HRI's law firm, Sharps and Associates, the examiner and
the client developed a settlement which provided the member with $35,000
for future medical expenses and protected HRI's client from the first $35,000
in future bills, should the injured party still be insured at the time of
her surgery. The settlement was accepted by all parties.</P>

<P>HRI subsequently recovered more than $154,000 from the boyfriend's remaining
liability and medical benefits' policies.</P>

<P>The HRI examiner's dedicated efforts to understand the member's situation,
combined with their sensitivity to the member's relationship with the liable
party, proved to be beneficial for all the parties involved. The HRI emphasis
on fully understanding each and every situation became the determining factor
in the positive resolution of this Case of the Quarter.</P>

<P><A NAME="anchor1379709"></A><B>HRI/Client Partnerships: Beating the Odds</B></P>

<P>Outsourcing is often the best option in today's fast and cost conscious
world of business. Experienced managers have learned that outsourcing is
most successful when they maintain a sense of commitment to the outcome.
They know the best results are obtained when they provide their vendors
thoughtful and timely input. This Case of the Quarter demonstrates the importance
of HRI's client partnerships.</P>

<P>HRI routinely searches for more than 3,500 ICD-9 codes to identify accidents
among its clients' paid claims. Potential accidents may be rejected for
many legitimate reasons -- but occasionally personal circumstances prevent
an accident from qualifying for recovery. In these cases, HRI's client contacts
can provide valuable information. This was the situation in a recent case.</P>

<P>HRI's client contact was aware of a member who was a known hemophiliac,
and who had been involved in an accident on the job. While processing the
claims resulting from this member's accident, the client discovered that
the file was not reported on HRI's monthly reports. He called the HRI recovery
examiner to investigate the situation. The examiner determined that HRI
had not received the claims data from the client due to the treatment being
attributed to the member's hemophilia, rather than an accident.</P>

<P>The client's early notice of its payment to the provider gave HRI an
edge in pursuing this recovery. And, the examiner fully applied HRI's philosophy
of planned persistence in working through the file.</P>

<P>Her investigation uncovered the fact that the hospital had originally
billed the state's Workers Compensation Bureau but had been denied payment
due to an error in the ICD-9 code. She successfully encouraged the hospital
to correct the error and resubmit the claims to the Bureau.</P>

<P>The examiner then focused her efforts on obtaining payment from the Bureau.
After repeated calls, the case appeared headed to conclusion -- but the
Bureau made only a token payment!</P>

<P>The examiner went back to the drawing board to develop a strategic action
plan. Her persistence in directly contacting the hospital administrator
resulted in the hospital making a special payment request to the Bureau.</P>

<P>Four months and countless phone calls later, HRI recovered full payment
of $181,000 for its client on the member's accident claims!</P>

<P>HRI's examiner summed it up, &quot;The client's personal knowledge of
the member's health circumstances helped set this recovery in motion; and
HRI's philosophy of persistence really paid off. This is a great example
of how important the HRI/client partnership is to beating the odds!&quot;</P>

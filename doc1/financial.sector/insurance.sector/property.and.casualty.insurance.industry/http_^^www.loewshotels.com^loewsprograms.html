<B>Access</B><BR>
<BR>
Small meetings are a very big deal at Loews Hotels. So we created ACCESS,
a streamlined, single source program to plan and confirm your small meetings
in just 24 hours! From start to finish, you deal with just one specially
trained ACCESS manager who is your full time partner for instant confirmations,
contracts, set-ups, menus, AV, on-site coordination, everything. At Loews
Hotels we can guarantee your small meeting to be a huge success with ACCESS.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Rush</B><BR>
<BR>
Even painstakingly planned meetings have eleventh hour surprises. That's
when RUSH comes to the rescue. Simply pick up a special RUSH telephone &quot;hot
line&quot; (you'll find them in every meeting room) and a RUSH dispatcher
delivers whatever you want, whenever and wherever you want it. We're not
just talking pitchers of ice water, either. We routinely pull off the impossible
with ease. <BR>

Loews Hotels loves kids and we make it easy for the family to travel together.
At all Loews Hotels, children under 18 stay free, kids under 10 receive
a welcome kit on arrival and child-proof kits are available for children
under four. Cribs and roll-away beds are free. Just ask for one. We also
have lending game libraries, special menus, tours, supervised recreational
programs and more.

Loews Hotels is the proud recipient of the 1996 President's Service Award,
the nation's highest honor given for volunteerism and social responsibility,
in recognition of our Good Neighbor Policy.<BR>
<BR>
At Loews Hotels we want to do our best for the people around us and the
planet we all share. So we created the hospitality industry's first and
most comprehensive outreach effort, the Good Neighbor Policy, to support
local food banks and assistance programs, literacy programs, recycling efforts,
energy-conservation and more. It takes real commitment to create better
communities. We're pleased to do all we can and proud to support our employee
individual volunteer efforts as well.

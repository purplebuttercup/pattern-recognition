<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=+1>
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has two classes of common stock designated Class A and Class B.  A share of Class B common stock has the rights of 1/30th of a share of Class A common stock with these exceptions:  First, a Class B share has 1/200th of the voting rights of a Class A share (rather than 1/30th of the vote).  Second, the Class B shares are not eligible to participate in the Berkshire Hathaway Inc. shareholder designated contributions program.  Press <A HREF=1996ar/shcontri.html>HERE</A> for a description of the program.  Additionally, each share of a Class A common stock is convertible at any time, at the holder's option, into 30 shares of Class B common stock.  This conversion privilege does not extend in the opposite direction.  That is, holders of Class B shares are not able to convert them into Class A shares.  Both Class A & B shareholders are entitled to attend the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting which is held the first Monday In May.

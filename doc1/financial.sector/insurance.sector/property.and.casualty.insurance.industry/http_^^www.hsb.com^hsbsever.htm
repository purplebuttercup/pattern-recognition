href="#Electrical"><font size="3">electrical equipment and
systems</font></a><font size="3">, or </font><a href="#Machinery"><font
size="3">machinery</font></a><font size="3"> have been exposed to
flood waters, you risk their loss even when the water level has
dropped. Equipment and machinery may have water, silt or other
contaminants within them. Your equipment could be damaged or
destroyed if you attempt to start or test it without adequate
cleaning and preparation for operation. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO OPERATE
OR TEST YOUR EQUIPMENT WITHOUT PROPERLY RESTORING IT. Even when
your equipment's exterior appears normal, residual moisture and
contaminants can lead to permanent damage and extend the
interruption of your operations. </font></p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Dry and Clean Before Using<br>
</b></font><font size="3">The following steps will help you
prepare your equipment for operation. Most actions involve
careful draining, drying, cleaning or lubricating of equipment
before attempting to start or energize it. Taking these simple
precautions can help you avoid a major equipment failure and
restore operations sooner.</font></p>

<p><a name="Boilers"><font size="4"><b>Boilers: Do Not Operate
Until Inspected and Tested</b></font></a></p>

<ol type="1" start="1">
    <li><font size="3">Carefully inspect foundations and settings
        of boilers for settlement. DO NOT OPERATE a boiler if
        there is any evidence of undermining of the foundation.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Make sure the setting is thoroughly dry.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">All safety appliances, such as safety and
        relief valves, steam gauge, water column, high- and
        low-water cut-offs, and blow-down valves must be cleaned
        and repaired as needed.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">All controls must be inspected and tested
        before operation, especially the water-level control and
        low-water fuel cut-off.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Burners should not be fired until checked
        by a burner technician. A furnace explosion may occur if
        the combustion controls do not function properly.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Boilers should not be operated if proper
        feedwater is not available. If operation is essential,
        and if feedwater contains mud, it will be necessary to
        blow down the boiler every eight hours and to open and
        clean it once a week until proper water quality is
        reestablished. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><a name="Electrical"><font size="4"><b>Electrical Equipment:
Keep It Turned off Until Dried and Cleaned</b></font></a></p>

<ol type="1" start="1">
    <li><font size="3">DO NOT ENERGIZE equipment that has been
        flooded until it has been properly cleaned, dried out,
        and until its insulation has been tested. This includes
        enclosures, bus ducts, conduit, and cables.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Windings in electrical machinery should
        not be dried at temperatures exceeding the rating of the
        insulation system. In general, a maximum temperature of
        194ºF or 90ºC may be used. If possible, check with the
        manufacturer for information and recommendations.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Dry-type transformers should be cleaned
        and dried as prescribed for machinery windings.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Oil-filled transformers should be
        thoroughly inspected and oil samples should be drawn for
        lab analysis. The laboratory should be requested to
        include a Karl Fisher test for water content. The maximum
        permissible water content is 35 ppm.</font></li>

<p><a name="Machinery"><font size="4"><b>Machinery: Drain, Clean
and Lubricate Before Testing</b></font></a></p>

<ol type="1" start="1">
    <li><font size="3">Contact the manufacturer, if possible, for
        recommendations.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Inspect foundations for cracking,
        weakness, or settlement. If settlement is suspected,
        check alignment of all shafting, as well as coupled
        connections.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Inspect all machine internals for silt
        accumulation and clean as needed.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Drain and clean lubrication systems. Wipe
        oil-containing elements with lint-free rags and refill
        with new lubricants as required.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Open the cylinders of all reciprocating
        machines and remove foreign material or water.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Carefully clean and TEST governors and
        controls.</font></li>

<h2>HSB Holds Annual Meeting</h2>

<p>HARTFORD, CT, April 16, 1996 -- At the annual meeting of
shareholders of The Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and
Insurance Company (NYSE-HSB), held today at the company's
headquarters, President and Chief Executive Officer Gordon W.
Kreh discussed results for 1995 and the outlook for 1996 and
beyond.</p>

<p>Also at the meeting, shareholders voted to re-elect four
directors and to appoint independent public accountants. A
shareholder proposal to eliminate the classified structure of the
board was not adopted.</p>

<p>Commenting on last year, President Kreh said, &quot;By all
measures, 1995 was a very successful year.&quot; Earnings per
share were $3.07 in 1995 compared to $2.54 in 1994, an increase
of 20.9 percent, and total revenues were $672.2 million in 1995
compared to $603.6 million in 1994, an increase of 11.4 percent.
In 1995, insurance operations produced a combined ratio of 90.7
percent compared to 93.0 percent in 1994. Kreh said, &quot;Due to
our loss prevention efforts, our combined ratio was far better
than the industry average, which was 107.2 percent in 1995.&quot;</p>

<p>Kreh said that net engineering services revenues were $252.1
million in 1995, an increase of 8.6 percent over the previous
year, while the net margin improved from 7.9 percent to 8.9
percent - the highest since 1984. &quot;This was achieved through
growth at Radian and improved margins at HSB Reliability
Technologies (the company's reliability improvement consulting
and services firm),&quot; Kreh said.</p>

<p>Shareholders' equity increased 14.6 percent, from $14.67 per
share at December 31, 1994 to $16.81 per share at December 31,
1995.</p>

<p>&quot;While we can take pride in our financial results, we
also have made great strides in addressing our strategic goals
and expanding our strategic alliances,&quot; Kreh said. Earlier
this year Hartford Steam Boiler and The Dow Chemical Company
formed a new company, Radian International LLC, to provide
environmental, information technology and strategic chemical
management services to industries and government worldwide. And
in October 1995, Hartford Steam Boiler increased its
participation in Industrial Risk Insurers (IRI) from 0.5 percent
to 14 percent. &quot;We expect to take a leading role in helping
IRI provide property insurance and loss prevention services more
effectively and more profitably,&quot; Kreh said.</p>

<p>Looking ahead President Kreh said, &quot;Our focus is the
customer, because Hartford Steam Boiler is in business to create
value for our customer. We believe that we can better serve our
customer by increasing our understanding of our business
environment and the nature of risk.&quot; A consistent marketing
planning process is being instituted organization-wide to help
accomplish the first goal, he said. &quot;At the same time, we
have established a new unit that is increasing our understanding
of risk in all forms, particularly the frequency and severity of
loss to equipment.&quot; He said that these initiatives will help
the company better serve its customers - and in particular its
domestic reinsured client companies and the global market outside
of the United States and Canada, areas with the greatest future
growth potential.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;We are keenly aware that our mission is to help our
    customers avoid losses,&quot; Kreh said. &quot;We are an
    engineering services firm. That is how we began in 1866 and
    that is what has always distinguished us from other companies
    that provide insurance. The concept that underlies our
    business is that our customers would rather prevent losses
    than be paid for them.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In summary, President Kreh said, &quot;We believe we have in
place a solid strategic plan for increasing our shareholders'
value. Our potential for growth is strong.&quot;</p>

<p>Re-elected for three year terms on the company's board of
directors were Joel B. Alvord, chairman of Fleet Financial Group;
Richard G. Dooley, a consultant to Massachusetts Mutual Life
Insurance Company; Gordon W. Kreh, president and chief executive
officer of Hartford Steam Boiler; and Lois D. Rice, a guest
scholar at the Brookings Institution.</p>

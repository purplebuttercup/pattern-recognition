<p><a name="Fourth"><b>Hartford Steam Boiler Reports Fourth
Quarter Results </b></a></p>

<p>HARTFORD, CT, January 22, 1996 -- The Hartford Steam Boiler
Inspection and Insurance Company (NYSE-HSB) today reported that
net income increased 23 percent in the fourth quarter of 1995
compared to the fourth quarter of 1994, increasing from 66 cents
per share to 81 cents per share. Income, excluding realized
investment gains, increased 22 percent from 64 cents to 78 cents
compared to the fourth quarter of 1994.</p>

<p>In his letter to shareholders, President and Chief Executive
Officer Gordon W. Kreh said, &quot;This quarter's 78 cents per
share continues our trend of increasing quarterly earnings.
Income for the year, excluding realized investment gains, was up
26 percent increasing from $2.35 to $2.96.&quot;</p>

<p>Kreh said the combined ratio for the quarter of 91.4 percent
compares to 91.6 percent for the fourth quarter of 1994.
Insurance premiums increased 17 percent from those reported for
the fourth quarter of 1994.</p>

<p>&quot;Engineering services revenue for the quarter grew 3
percent from the same period a year ago and was down 6 percent
from the third quarter of 1995 due to a temporary slowdown in
government business at Radian,&quot; Kreh said. &quot;For the
year the operating margin was 8.9 percent.&quot;</p>

<p>Kreh said, that due to an increase in investable funds, net
investment income of $7.8 million was 10 percent higher than the
fourth quarter of 1994.</p>

<p>&quot;By the end of January,&quot; Kreh said, &quot;the joint
venture combining Radian Corporation, Hartford Steam Boiler's
subsidiary, and DEI, a subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company, is
expected to begin operations.&quot; Plans for the new company,
Radian LLC, were initially announced October 23 (1995). Hartford
Steam Boiler will have a 40 percent ownership interest in Radian
LLC.</p>

<H3>Company History </H3>
Old Republic National Title opened for business in 1907.  The Company, then named Real Estate Title Insurance Company, was incorporated in Minneapolis with assets of $200,000.<P>

Several Minneapolis abstract companies were acquired in 1929, and our corporate name was changed to Title Insurance Company of Minnesota (Minnesota Title).  We also signed our first agents that year.<P>

 In 1941, Minnesota Title became one of the first title companies to conduct business across state lines by becoming licensed and signing agents in Florida.  The states of Georgia, Missouri, Ohio, and Utah soon followed.  Today, we are licensed in 48 states and the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.<P>

 In 1978, Old Republic International Corporation (ORI), a multi-line insurance holding company headquartered in Chicago, purchased Minnesota Title.  The Old Republic Title Insurance Group (ORTIG) was formed as ORI's title insurance holding company in 1980, with Minnesota Title as the national underwriting company and our affiliated companies as members.  With Minnesota Title's purchase of Mississippi Valley Title Insurance Company, Jackson, Mississippi, ORTIG gained a second, regional underwriter.  In 1993, Old Republic National Title began issuing joint title policies with Mississippi Valley Title in Mississippi, Alabama and parts of Tennessee.  The Group gained a third underwriter with the acquisition of American Guaranty Title Co. of Oklahoma City in 1996.<P>

 Also in 1980, Founders Title Group, Minnesota Title's largest California agent, became a sister-company through its acquisition by ORI.  Lincoln Title Company, another Minnesota Title agent in California, was purchased by ORI in 1988, giving the ORTIG family an even stronger foothold in one of the country's fastest growing real estate markets.  Another sister company, Founders Title Insurance Corporation, was formed in 1989 to reinsure all of the title policies issued by the Founders Title Group in the Western States in which it conducts business.<P>

<H3>Name Changes</H3>
At year-end 1992, the majority of ORTIG's member companies adopted the Old Republic name, not only to reflect ORTIG's long-term relationship with its parent, but to clarify and promote the Group's size, financial strength and national capabilities.  Minnesota Title became Old Republic National Title Insurance Company, Founders Title Insurance Corporation became Old Republic General Title Insurance Corporation (Old Republic General), and Founders Title Group became Old Republic Title Company.

<H3>Title Insurance Ratings</H3>
In 1995,  ORTIG's key insurance subsidiaries  Old Republic National Title, Old Republic General and Mississippi Valley Title Insurance Company received their fifth consecutive A+ claims-paying ability rating from <A HREF="/sandp.html">Standard &amp; Poor's</A> (S&amp;P).  ORTIG's A+ rating, the highest given by S&amp;P to any title insurer to date, falls within S&amp;P's secure category, indicating good financial security.  At present, two other national title underwriters have been evaluated by S&amp;P, both receiving claims-paying ability ratings of A.  Old Republic National Title, ORTIG's primary underwriter, has also received the top title insurance

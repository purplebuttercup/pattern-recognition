<P>

                This may be the most pleasurable thing you'll ever have to do to get an
                inexpensive airline ticket.  Simply spend one or more nights at a Loews
                Hotel, and pay any published rate, including the great seasonal rates
                listed below.  Then, when you purchase an American Airlines ticket at any
                published excursion fare, you can bring a friend along for just $99.  This
                companion ticket is good for travel anywhere in the continental United
                States.  And AAdvantage members will earn 500 bonus miles with every
                qualifying stay - for a total of 1,000 AAdvantage miles!  For reservations
                simply complete the <A HREF="http://www.loewshotels.com/reserve.html">on-line reservation form</A> or call 1-800-23-LOEWS.

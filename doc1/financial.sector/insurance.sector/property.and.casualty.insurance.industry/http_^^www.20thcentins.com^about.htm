        <p><font size="4"><b>20th Century Industries</b> is the
        eighth largest publicly-held personal automobile insurer
        in the United States and the fifth largest insurer of
        private passenger automobiles in California.<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">20th Century Industries markets
        personal automobile and personal excess liability
        insurance exclusively in California through it's two
        wholly-owned subsidiaries: 20th Century Insurance Company
        and 21st Century Casualty Company. Currently, 20th
        Century insures approximately one million automobiles
        throughout the state. The company receives 75 percent of
        its new business through referrals from current
        policyholders and the annual renewal rate of existing
        policyholders is well in excess of 96 percent.<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">At year-end 1996, 20th Century
        Industries' assets totaled $1.5 billion with $937.1
        million in revenues. In 1996, the company wrote $828
        million in net premiums. Headquartered in Woodland Hills,
        California, 20th Century is traded on the New York Stock
        Exchange under the trading symbol TW.<br>

        <hr>
        <p><font size="4"><b>Operating Philosophy</b><br>
        20th Century was founded in Los Angeles in 1958, using a
        business philosophy of direct sales to the customer
        without the necessity of commissioned agents. Because the
        company insures only responsible motorists, 20th Century
        policyholders benefit from premium rates that are among
        the lowest in the state while still receiving full
        coverage and service. This has been proven through annual
        surveys conducted by the California Department of
        Insurance in which 20th Century has consistently ranked
        in the top five lowest-priced insurance rates in the
        state. <br>
        </font></p>
        <hr>
        <p><font size="4"><b>Employees/Facilities</b><br>
        20th Century has nearly 2,300 employees and occupies an
        11-story headquarters building. The company also operates
        14 Division Service offices, 3 Vehicle Inspection Centers

        Costa Counties.<br>

        <p><font size="4"><b>Senior Management</b><br>
        20th Century's senior management team is led by William
        L. Mellick, the company's president, chief executive
        officer, and member of the Board of Directors. A 30-year
        veteran of the industry, Mr. Mellick has served in a
        variety of management capacities for 20th Century for 18
        years.<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">20th Century's Board of Directors is
        chaired by John B. De Nault. A Los Angeles private
        investor, Mr. De Nault previously held the position of
        Vice Chairman of the Board, and has served as a director
        since the company's founding.<br>

        <hr>
        <p><font size="4"><b>History</b><br>
        20th Century's success story begins with its founder,
        Louis W. Foster. After 20 years in the insurance business
        as an independent agent, Mr.Foster founded 20th Century
        in 1958 in downtown Los Angeles as an inter-insurance
        exchange, which is similar to a cooperative, where
        policyholders would bind themselves together in order to
        finance and insure the losses of other policyholders. The
        small office with one employee grew rapidly and, in 1966,
        the company moved to Century City to accommodate its
        expanding staff and volume of policies. The company
        celebrated a major milestone at the same time - 20th
        Century had written $1 million in premiums in a single
        year.<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">In 1968, the decision was made to
        convert the inter-insurance exchange to a capital stock
        company for two reasons. First, the federal government
        had minimized the tax advantages for the exchange.
        Secondly, the California Department of Insurance raised
        the capital and surplus requirements of reciprocals to $1
        million. The decision was considered one of the most
        unique in the annals of business in California. The
        policyholders of the exchange ultimately became
        stockholders in the newly structured 20th Century
        Industries. The profits in the exchange were used as a
        base for measuring the amount of equity the policyholder
        would be entitled to in the new company. As a result,
        people who had bought insurance to save money received
        the added benefit of becoming stockholders.<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">The decision served the company well.
        In 1969, 20th Century wrote $2 million in premiums; $5
        million was reached in 1972; and $10 million in 1975.<br>
        In 1980, the company moved from its Century City offices
        to its current 11-story building in Woodland Hills. Its
        spectacular growth curve continued, writing $100 million
        in premiums in 1982; $200 million in 1984; $500 million
        in 1987; and over $1billion in 1993. The successful
        history of 20th Century Industries is perhaps best put
        into perspective when this is considered: When Mr. Foster
        began 20th Century Industries, friends and business
        associates bought 273,000 shares of stock at $1 a piece.
        By year-end 1996, a dollar of stock issued when 20th
        Century converted to a stock company in 1968 was worth
        $2,430.</font></p>

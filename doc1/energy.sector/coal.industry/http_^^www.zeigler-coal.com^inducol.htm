<P>Coal is mined in 32 states, seven of which account for 81 percent of the
country's reserves. The three major U.S. coal regions consist of Appalachia
(West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Eastern Kentucky, and Ohio), the
Illinois Basin (Illinois, Indiana and Western Kentucky) and the Powder River
Basin (Wyoming and Montana).
</P>
<P>General observations can be made about the coal and coal mining methods for
each of these regions. Appalachian mines are  both surface and underground, with
coal that tends to be high in energy content and low in sulfur. Illinois Basin
mines are generally underground, yielding coal that is high in energy content
but also high in sulfur. Powder River Basin coal is generally mined from the
surface and the coal, while often lower in energy content, is known for its
particularly low sulfur content. Zeigler subsidiaries have major operations and
reserves in all three coal producing regions.
</P>
<P>Technology's impact on coal mining has been most significant in the mining
process itself. The most visible impact of technology is that modern machines
have largely replaced manual labor in coal mines. Consequently, the coal miner
has become, for the most part, an operator of highly sophisticated equipment and
someone whose knowledge we value in improving mining processes - in stark
contrast with the manual laborer of the industry's past.
</P>
<P>The coal mining work force of the 1990s is compensated based on their skill
levels. Industry-wide annual wages average $38,000, and many miners make
considerably more through overtime productions bonuses. Most are covered by
extensive health and pension benefits.
</P>
<P>Mining is also safer today than it has ever been. In fact, according to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, it is safer to work in a coal mine than in 20 other
industries, including transportation, durable-goods manufacturing, construction,
farming, and even retailing. In the past quarter century, fatalities relating to
coal mining have declined 80 percent while production has nearly doubled. 	</P>
<P><B>Modern Coal 	</B></P>
<P>While you are shedding images, discard your perception of picks and shovels.
They long ago gave way to a new breed of gargantuan equipment that roams coal
seams in a historic echo of the dinosaurs that once prowled the same geology.
Coal mining in the 1990s has evolved into a modern, high-tech business. Heavily
computerized equipment. Dragline rigs outlined against the skyline. Conveyors
snaking 9,000 feet down a mountainside. Coal trucks towering 15 feet over the
nearest worker, that's mining today...  the marriage of an abundant natural
resource and technology. 	</P>
<P>Today's state-of-the-art equipment generally falls into several different
categories. Two types are for underground use - longwall and continuous mining
equipment - while draglines and truck-and-shovel methods are used for surface
mining operations.
</P>
<P>The mines where this equipment is used do not look much like the images of
old, either. In today's underground mine, the walls are white, covered with a
lime coating that prevents coal dust. Constant fresh air flows steadily through
the mine, moved by huge ventilation fans on the surface. Personal protective
equipment is widespread: hard-hats, steel-toed boots, hearing protection, air
purifying systems and high intensity lamps are standard issue. 	</P>
<P>Zeigler views mining as a temporary use of the land. When a mine's
economically recoverable reserves have been depleted, Zeigler returns the land
and water to as good, or better, condition as before mining. 	</P>
<P>Since 1974, the U.S. coal industry has reclaimed more than two million acres
of land - an area larger than the state of Delaware.

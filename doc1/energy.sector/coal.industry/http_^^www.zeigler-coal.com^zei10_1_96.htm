Heights, Ill., October 1, 1996</B> &#173; Zeigler Coal Holding Company (NYSE:
ZEI) confirmed today that Southern Electric International, Inc. has joined in
the offer by NRG Energy and Zeigler to purchase the non-nuclear assets of Cajun
Electric Power Cooperative of Baton Rouge, La.  The newly combined offer was
incorporated in an amended plan filed by the Cajun trustee in bankruptcy court
yesterday.  Under the plan, the assets would be acquired by Louisiana
Generating, LLC, which would be owned by affiliates of Southern Electric, NRG
Energy and Zeigler.  Southern Electric will be withdrawing the competing plan it
filed June 26. 
<P>A Zeigler subsidiary has supplied nearly all of the coal provided to Cajun
since 1982.  The Zeigler family of companies is among the largest coal producers
and marketers in the United States, and controls more than 1.3 billion tons of
economically recoverable coal reserves, including 1 billion tons of low sulfur
coal.  The Zeigler family of companies currently operates underground and
surface coal mining complexes in Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and
Wyoming.  In addition, the company owns and operates two East Coast transloading
terminals and the ENCOAL clean coal technology corporation.

announce </P>
<P>signing of contract for construction of LFC plant; </P>
<P>increased environmental benefits indicated</P>

<P>[The following release contains forward-looking
statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties
inherent in the company's business. The company's actual
results could differ materially from those anticipated in
those forward-looking statements as a result of certain
factors, including those set forth in documents filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, within the company's
Forms 10-K and 10-Q.]</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>ENCOAL Corporation and Americoal Development company,
subsidiaries of Zeigler Coal Holding Company (NYSE: ZEI),
today announced that their newly formed company - NuCoal, LLC
- has signed contracts with Mitsubishi International
Corporation for construction of a full-scale Liquids From
Coal (LFC) plant in Wyoming. Completion of the facility is
subject to certain conditions including obtaining
construction and permanent financing and all necessary
permits.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>The new agreements call for the engineering, procurement
and construction of a three module LFC processing facility
capable of processing six million tons of coal feedstock per
year. The contract cost of the LFC plant will be
approximately $460 million.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>The LFC technology is owned and licensed by TEK-KOL, a
partnership of a Zeigler subsidiary and SGI International,
the inventor of the technology. Mitsibushi and TEK-KOL have
for the past year been engaged in advanced feasibility
studies regarding the prospective joint engineering and
construction of commercial LFC plants, including this plant
and potential projects in Indonesia and Russia. The LFC
technology converts low-rank coals into the following two
products: </P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<UL compact><LI>Process Derived Fuel (PDF), a low-sulfur,
low-NOx clean coal product that has a lower sulfur content
and higher heating value than the source coal, and </LI>
<LI>Coal Derived Liquid (CDL), a low-sulfur hydrocarbon
liquid with several distillate components that can be used as
a fuel and has components that can be used as chemical
feedstocks.</LI>
</UL>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Jim Mahler, ENCOAL executive and President of Zeigler's
Americoal Development Company, said in announcing the
construction agreements that recent testing of ENCOAL's solid
fuel product resulted in a greater than 15% reduction of
nitrous oxide emissions, or NOx. &quot;The 'EN' in ENCOAL
stands for 'environment,'&quot; said Mahler. &quot;And recent
test burns indicate that the products produced by ENCOAL are
even kinder to the environment than we previously
believed.&quot;</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>He said that power plant testing of PDF had demonstrated
five primary environmental benefits that indicate that it is
superior to its feedstock-coal counterpart which is already
low in sulfur:</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<OL compact><LI>Reduces sulfur dioxide an additional 25 to
30%.</LI>
<LI>Reduces by 20 to 30% the physical amount of coal product
needed to be burned to produce an equivalent amount of
Btus.</LI>
<LI>Reduces emissions of nitrous oxides (NOx) by 15% or more
at certain power plants when compared to coals typically
burned at these plants. </LI>
<LI>Improves combustion efficiency by as much as 5%, and
</LI>
<LI>Reduces solid waste disposal by as much as 5%.</LI>
</OL>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Zeigler coal annually fuels more than 50 billion kilowatt
hours of power in the United States, or nearly 2 percent of
all domestic electricity. The Zeigler family of companies is
among the largest coal producers and marketers in the United
States, and controls more than 1.3 billion tons of
economically recoverable coal reserves, including 1 billion
tons of low sulfur coal. Zeigler subsidiaries currently
operate underground and surface coal mining complexes in
Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Wyoming, which
mine primarily steam coal for electricity generation. Zeigler
subsidiaries also operate two East Coast import/export
terminals and the ENCOAL clean coal technology demonstration
plant. A Zeigler affiliate has a joint bid with Southern
Electric International and NRG Energy pending to purchase out
of bankruptcy the non-nuclear assets of Louisiana-based Cajun
Electric Power Cooperative. And EnerZ Corporation, an energy
trading and marketing firm, has been created to take
advantage of opportunities growing out of utility
deregulation.</P>

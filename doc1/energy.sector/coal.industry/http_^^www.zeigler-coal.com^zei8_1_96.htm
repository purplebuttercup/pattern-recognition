</B><I>August 1, 1996</I><BR><BR><BR>
<H2>Zeigler/NRG, Trustee Forge Amended Cajun Agreement</H2>Zeigler Coal Holding
Company (NYSE: ZEI) and NRG Energy, Inc., the non-regulated affiliate of
Minneapolis-based Northern States Power Company (NYSE: NSP), today reported that
their affiliate (Louisiana Generating LLC) has amended its agreement with the
bankruptcy trustee and satisfied key concerns to allow continuation of a joint
bid to purchase the non-nuclear assets of Cajun Electric Power Cooperative, Inc.
of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. 
<BR><BR>The $1.1 billion NRG/Zeigler proposal was originally made in response
to a request for proposals from the bankruptcy trustee for the Cajun estate.  In
April, NRG/Zeigler's submittal was selected as the lead proposal by the
bankruptcy trustee.  He then filed with the bankruptcy court a plan of
reorganization that incorporated the proposal on April 22, 1996, and submitted a
definitive purchase agreement on June 15, 1996.  On July 15, the bankruptcy
court declared as reasonable some but not all buyer protection provisions in the
NRG/Zeigler definitive agreement and provided guidance on related provisions
that would be acceptable.
<BR><BR> Key elements of the amended Asset Purchase and Reorganization
Agreement between NRG/Zeigler and the bankruptcy trustee include: 
<UL>
<LI>Buyer protection provisions addressing the concerns raised by the
bankruptcy judge in his July 15 order; 	
</LI>
<LI>A purchase price adjustment based on interest rate fluctuations through the
confirmation hearings; and 
</LI>
<LI>Rate reduction for Cajun's members to 40.0 mills, consistent with
discussions between NRG/Zeigler and the members' committee.
</LI></UL>According to a statement by the NRG/Zeigler team, &quot;The revised
agreement with the trustee resolves concerns that could have prevented our joint
participation in the plan confirmation process, and we believe it also addresses
the issues expressed by the bankruptcy judge in his July 15th order.  We are
pleased that the trustee continues to believe that the Zeigler/NRG proposal
represents the best overall option.  We look forward to using the time prior to
the confirmation hearing to develop a solid consensus between us and the other
stakeholders.&quot; 
<BR><BR>The Zeigler family of companies is among the largest coal producers
and marketers in the United States, and controls more than 1.3 billion tons of
economically recoverable coal reserves, including 1 billion tons of low sulfur
coal.  The Zeigler family of companies currently operates underground and
surface coal mining complexes in Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and
Wyoming.  In addition, the company owns and operates two East Coast transloading
terminals and ENCOAL, a clean coal technology corporation.  A Zeigler subsidiary
has supplied more than 90% of the coal provided to Cajun since 1982. 
<BR><BR>NRG is one of the leading participants in the independent power
generation industry.  Established in 1989, and wholly owned by Northern States
Power, NRG is principally engaged in the acquisition, development and operation
of independent power production and transmission facilities, thermal energy
production and transmission facilities and resource recovery facilities.  NRG
has a proven track record in operating, maintaining and owning interests in
large, fossil-fuel generation facilities.

<H2>Zeigler Boosts Quarterly Dividend 50%, Announces Share Repurchase Program</H2><B>Fairview
Heights, Illinois, August 7, 1996</B> &#173; Zeigler Coal Holding Company
President and Chief Executive Officer Chand B. Vyas today announced that the
Zeigler board of directors has authorized a 50% increase in the cash dividend
and a repurchase of up to 1 million of the company's outstanding shares. 
<BR><BR>&quot;I am pleased to announce this dividend increase,&quot; said 
Vyas.  &quot;This action reflects both our continuing strong performance and our
confidence in the company's prospects.&quot; 
<BR><BR>The new quarterly cash dividend of 7.5 cents per share (30 cents per
share annualized) represents a quarterly increase of 2.5 cents per share over
the previous cash dividend of 5 cents per share.  The dividend is payable
October 3, 1996, to shareholders of record September 13, 1996. 
<BR><BR>Zeigler also announced the planned repurchase of up to 1 million of
the company's common shares.  The shares will be purchased from time to time in
the open market over the next 24 months, largely to provide a non-dilutive
mechanism to fulfill obligations under the company's incentive stock option
plans.   
<BR><BR>&quot;Our use of stock options is consistent with our long-standing
commitment to align managers' interests with shareholders,&quot; said Vyas.  &quot;And
our repurchase plan enables us to satisfy our option program needs with minimal
effects upon our outstanding shares.&quot; 
<BR><BR>Vyas stated that the dividend increase and repurchase program will not
restrict the company's growth plans. 
<BR><BR>Zeigler currently has 28,360,816 shares outstanding.  The Zeigler
family of companies is among the largest coal producers and marketers in the
United States, and controls more than 1.3 billion tons of economically
recoverable coal reserves, including 1 billion tons of low sulfur coal.  The
Zeigler family of companies currently operates underground and surface coal
mining complexes  in Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Wyoming, which
mine primarily steam coal.  In addition, the company operates two East Coast
import/export terminals and the ENCOAL clean coal technology corporation.

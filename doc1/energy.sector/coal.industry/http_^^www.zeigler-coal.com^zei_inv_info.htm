<TD>
<P><B>STRONG GROWTH:</B> Zeigler has a history of strong growth, increasing
revenues, earnings and cash more than 9-fold since 1985. Zeigler remains a
strong value play, trading at a P/E multiple that significantly trails the S &amp;
P 500, despite a five-year projected growth rate by analysts that exceeds the S
&amp; P 500.  And Zeigler is committed to growth and increased shareholder
value, as witnessed by Chief Executive Officer Chand B. Vyas' stated &quot;20-20
Vision&quot; target.
<P>
<B>ALIGNMENT WITH CUSTOMERS:</B>  Zeigler is committed to greater customer
alignment.  In response to the demands of the 1990 Clean Air Act, for instance,
Zeigler has transitioned from high-sulfur coal operations to a coal portfolio
with an overwhelmingly low-sulfur profile.  And Zeigler is helping its customers
position for deregulation by helping them to explore low-cost coal solutions,
innovative contract arrangements, power sales partnering and coal-by-wire
arrangements.
<P></P><B>INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY:</B>  Having largely proven the  
proprietary Liquids From Coal (LFC) Technology through subsidiary ENCOAL
Corporation, Zeigler is exploring commercialization of the process.  Through
TEK-KOL, Zeigler is a 50% owner of the proprietary technology that takes
lignites and sub-bituminous coals and reduces the sulfur, raises the heating
value and produces a commercial solid and liquid product. 
<P></P><B>GROWTH ALONG THE ELECTRICITY VALUE CHAIN:</B>  Zeigler   foresees
continued growth within its emerging power segment, as witnessed by the
company's participation in a $1.1 billion pending offer for the non-nuclear assets of Cajun
Electric, and the recent launch of EnerZ Corporation, an energy marketing and
trading firm.  As a result, investors are beginning to see Zeigler not as a pure
play in coal but              rather a unique investment in utility
deregulation.
<P></P><B>HISTORY OF BUYING AND IMPROVING PROPERTIES:</B>  Zeigler has made
three major acquisitions in 12 years, and has achieved average annual cost
reductions in the 3% to 5% range.
<P></P><B>EXPERIENCED AND MOTIVATED MANAGEMENT: </B> The top six officers have
170-plus combined years of business experience, more than 100 of which are
within the coal business.  Active management also owns in excess of 4% of
Zeigler stock.
<P></P><B>STRONG USE OF LEVERAGE:</B>  Zeigler's significant cash flow and $4.5
billion in contract backlog has given the company a large comfort level with
debt...  and a strong ability to pay down that leverage.  Zeigler has paid down
more than $350 million in debt since late 1992.  Of $345 in remaining debt, more
than 40% is in the form of industrial revenue bonds at a rate of less than 4%.

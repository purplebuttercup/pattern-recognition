<H2>Pier IX Terminal Company</H2><B>Newport News, Virginia</B>
<P></P>
<P>Pier IX Terminal Company in Newport News, Va., and Shipyard River  Terminal
in Charleston, S.C., offer services both to importers and exporters of coal and
other products along the East Coast. </P>
<P><B>Pier IX Terminal:</B> Pier IX, located at the Port of Hampton Roads, is
a leader in handling export coal and cement shipments. Pier IX offers an
additional means to benefit from the strong rebound U.S. coal exports are
enjoying. With shipments totaling 6.4 million tons, 1995 was a banner year for
the transloading facility, nearly doubling its 3.3-million-ton throughput in
1994. Americoal's strategy for sustaining Pier IX's success is to diversify its
handling capabilities. Specifically, the company is exploring transporting new
products and establishing strategic alliances to maximize the terminal's
12-million-ton throughput capacity. </P>
<P>A major Virginia award proves that Pier IX hasn't missed the boat on
environmental awareness. </P>
<P>Pier IX was honored in 1991 as a recipient of the Governor's Environmental
Excellence Award. Pier IX &quot;made exceptional contributions to the
stewardship of our resources,&quot; in the words of Virginia Governor Douglas
Wilder.</P>
<P> Pier IX developed an innovative storm-water collection system that the
governor said &quot;should serve as a model for businesses whose operations are
potentially damaging to the environment.&quot;</P>
<P>The system, unique among coal export facilities in North America, prevents
untreated, coal-contaminated storm water from entering the coastal water from
the pier. The system, consisting of containment curbs, ditches and pumping
stations, was installed and became operational in August 1991. The effort was
part of an overall emphasis on environmental concern at Pier IX that also
includes air quality, water quality, recycling and Adopt-A-Street programs &#173;
programs that also have received recognition for Pier IX from the Newport News
Clean Community Commission. </P>
<P>Pier IX Terminal Company is located in Newport News, Va. It occupies 66
acres on the James River at the Port of Hampton Roads, and is a leader in the
handling of export coal shipments and coastwise movements. Developed by A.T.
Massey Coal Company and opened in 1983, Pier IX's throughput capacity is 12
million tons of coal per year. Pier IX is capable of unloading coal from
railcars at a rate of 5,000 tons per hour, and loading coal on ships and barges
at a peak rate of 8,000 tons per hour. </P>
<P>CSX Railroad services the terminal, where U.S. coal is then shipped to
far-flung ports from Argentina to Yugoslavia. The terminal's computer system
provides inventory information on the total weight of coal in customers'
stockpiles. Accounting is done by rail weight for inbound coal and draft survey
for outbound coal. Total stockpile capacity is more than 1.36 million tons in
the 30-acre storage area. The system has a direct bypass mode, allowing coal
transfer directly from railcars to ships or barges. Both inbound and outbound
coal are sampled with three-stage ASTM samplers. </P>
<P>Pier IX also has the ability to blend coal from multiple stockpiles into the
vessel within 1 percent accuracy. Reclaimed coal is conveyed to an
8,000-ton-per-hour shiploader, which services vessels on either side of the
1,200-foot pier. Depth alongside the pier is 50 feet at mean low water, and the
shiploader can handle vessels up to 1,000 feet in length and 150 feet in width.
</P>
<P>In 1990, Pier IX implemented plans to diversify its product base, building
an import facility to unload or transload cement. The system can be expanded to
transship fly ash, pumice, salt, urea, potash, gypsum and other dry bulk
products. </P>   
<H2>Shipyard River Terminal Company</H2><B>Charleston, South Carolina</B>
<P></P>  
<P>Shipyard River Terminal Company is located in Charleston, S.C. It offers
deepwater facilities that provide global export capability for U.S. coal and
other products. SRT's beginning can be traced back to 1868, when the founding
company &#173; Combahee Fertilizer Company &#173; was formed. Through the years
the facility changed ownership numerous times and operated only as an import
terminal.</P>
<P>The terminal was developed by A.T. Massey Coal Company beginning in 1981,
and on April 3, 1983, it received the Japanese Sanko Line's WORLD FINANCE as
Shipyard's maiden ship. In 1987, Shell Mining Company completed acquisition of
the facility. </P>
<P>Today, Shipyard, a 52-acre import-export dry and liquid bulk product
handling facility, can accommodate coal, fertilizers, aggregates, asphalt and
other industrial minerals. An environmental, services division also has been
established, which currently, focuses on processing and treating waste water.
The coal yard, located at the confluence of the Cooper River and the Shipyard
River near downtown Charleston, has an annual throughput capacity of 2.5 million
tons per year and a ground storage capacity of 250,000 tons. Served directly by
Norfolk-Southern and CSX, the terminal can handle up to 300 rail cars, using an
80-car rail loop served by two yard locomotives. </P>
<P>The terminal can accommodate single vessels up to 850 feet long and 130 feet
wide. Shipyard River handles met, steam and stoker coal, offering the only
soft-load system on the East Coast.  
</P>
<P>Shipyard River handles approximately 20 product lines, of which coal is a
relatively minor component. Shipyard's management believes the key to optimizing
this terminal's 2.5-million-ton capacity will be to consolidate product lines by
increasing the mix of higher-margin segments. Americoal also is exploring
several higher-margin businesses for Shipyard's portfolio, which it expects to
develop in 1996.  </P>
<P>A strong safety mind-set at Shipyard has led to an impressive safety
accomplishment. In June 1996, Shipyard completed its second consecutive year &#173;
nearly 100,000 man hours &#173; without a lost-time accident. </P>
<P>Shipyard's basic safety philosophy is a combination of sincere commitment to
safety and involvement in the safety process by every employee. A collective
decision-making process helps keep employees aware of their responsibility for
their safety as well as the safety of everyone who works at the facility.
Employee recognition for safety milestones, safety and environmental team
participation, training, and open communication lines enable Shipyard River to
continue to develop a safety culture that involves all employees for continued
success.

<H2>Phoenix Land Company </H2>
The Zeigler family of companies owns or leases 2.9 billion tons of coal and
owns 100,000 acres of surface land in nine states. Phoenix Land Company provides
a broad range of services using these assets.
<BR><BR>Phoenix seeks to fuel future growth by acquiring and maintaining
strategic reserves required for long-term mining needs. In addition, Phoenix
serves as a profit center through the use and application of value-added
alternatives for properties not strategic for coal mining. Alternatives
undertaken or explored include timber harvesting, farming, use of land for
cattle ranching, drilling for oil and gas, and generation of royalty income
through third-party development of non-strategic coal reserves. Phoenix seeks to
divest non-strategic properties if alternate uses cannot demonstrate sustainable
20% returns on capital investment.
<BR><BR><B>A sampling of opportunities that Phoenix <BR>has completed or is
exploring includes:</B>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>a 1995 agreement with an Ohio operator that used surplus equipment as part
of a limestone-crushing and -screening plant</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>the concept of bundling land-use royalties with the leasing of Zeigler's
surplus equipment. For example, Phoenix recently contracted with a coal producer
in Kentucky to exchange an unused conveyer for royalties and fees</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>the prospect of secondary recovery of oil and gas reserves. Drawing on the
company's significant oil and gas reserve base and its knowledge of producers,
the company is exploring opportunities to invest in secondary recovery projects.
Such projects would entail using specialized methods to extract harder-to-reach
reserves when the wells' primary reserves have been exhausted. This relatively
low-risk investment should provide Zeigler with an additional income stream,
help attract oil and gas drilling to our lands, and increase oil and gas
royalties now being received.

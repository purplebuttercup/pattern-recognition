<H2>Zeigler EnerZ Subsidiary to  Compete in Deregulated Energy Marketplace</H2><B>Fairview
Heights, Illinois, September 26, 1996</B> &#173; Zeigler Coal Holding Company
(NYSE: ZEI) President and Chief Executive Officer Chand B. Vyas today announced
the launch of a new subsidiary, EnerZ Corporation, to take advantage of emerging
market opportunities growing out of utility deregulation. 
<P>EnerZ Corporation has filed an application with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) for status as a wholesale power marketer.  The
company expects to receive its approval from FERC later this fall, and to
initiate business transactions shortly thereafter.  EnerZ, a Delaware
corporation, is leasing office space in the New York area.
</P>
<P>According to Vyas, &quot;The chain of economic value for electricity
includes a number of core activities: fuel, transportation, clean air compliance
measures, generation, transmission and marketing.  We already participate along
a number of these links, and EnerZ provides us additional growth opportunities
to leverage off of our existing assets and expand our customer relationships.&quot;
</P>
<P>Vyas said Zeigler is pleased to have hired Tayeb Tahir as president of EnerZ
Corporation.  Tahir brings to EnerZ extensive experience in the power and
natural gas markets and skills in strategic integration of information
technology with the energy industry.  Tahir most recently served as a consultant
to utilities and other energy companies, with an emphasis on deregulation growth
strategies.  He has a Master's Degree in Gas Technology from the Illinois
Institute of Technology and an MBA from New York University.
</P>
<P>&quot;Because Zeigler coal annually fuels more than 50 billion kilowatt
hours of power in the United States, or nearly 2 percent of all domestic
electricity, Zeigler has been well-positioned to evaluate trends and
opportunities within the electric utility industry,&quot; said Vyas.  &quot;And
we made it clear earlier this year that we are trading in our front-row seat for
a place on the playing field.  EnerZ Corporation is one more manifestation of
this strategy.&quot; 
<P>The Zeigler family of companies is among the largest coal producers and
marketers in the United States, and controls more than 1.3 billion tons of
economically recoverable coal reserves, including 1 billion tons of low sulfur
coal. Zeigler subsidiaries currently operate underground and surface coal mining
complexes in Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Wyoming, which mine
primarily steam coal for electricity generation.  Zeigler subsidiaries also
operate two East Coast import/export terminals and the ENCOAL clean coal
technology corporation.  And a Zeigler affiliate has a joint bid with NRG Energy
pending to purchase out of bankruptcy the non-nuclear assets of Louisiana-based
Cajun Electric Power Cooperative.

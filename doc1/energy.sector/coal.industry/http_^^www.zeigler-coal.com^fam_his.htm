<TD ALIGN="JUSTIFY" WIDTH="410">Today, the Zeigler family of companies rank as
the nation's largest independent coal producers - and the sixth largest overall.
<P></P>Zeigler's coal producing subsidiaries have annual sales of approximately
$750 million. We have recoverable coal reserves of about 2.9 billion tons. And
we have an annual production of 35 million tons.
<P></P>Far more important than size, though, is the quality of our people, who
possess the capabilities and commitment needed to manage and operate some of the
finest operations in the United States. Through the finest skill and the
strongest will, they provide the perfect blend of time-honored dedication and
state-of-the-art techniques.
<P></P>The tradition of success that Zeigler can today reflect upon, however,
was only a dream at the turn of the century. Ninety years ago, when most people
viewed the coal industry as fragmented, disorganized and unprofitable, Joseph
Leiter saw coal as a diamond in the rough.
<P></P>When most believed the only good coal was Eastern coal, Joseph Leiter
declared that someday Illinois coal would supply Chicago and the nation.
<P></P>And when most laughed at Joseph Leiter for leaving Chicago for a rural
coal field in Franklin County, he quietly constructed Zeigler No. 1 Mine - and
had the last laugh. By 1908, Zeigler No. 1 Mine was the third-largest producing
mine in the nation, and within 20 years Zeigler Coal was common in 14
Mississippi Valley states, from Texas to Minnesota.
<P></P>Zeigler had surprised the industry ... and could point to a future
bright with promise.
<P></P> In 1910, the Bell and Zoller Company took charge of Zeigler operations
under a royalty arrangement. The Zeigler Coal and Coke Company was incorporated
in 1924, and grew through expansion and acquisition, purchasing the Hart Ross
Coal Company and the Cardinal Coal Company in 1948 and acquiring four Illinois
mines from Consolidated Coal Company in 1950. Also in 1950, Zeigler Coal and
Coke Company acquired the Bell and Zoller Coal Company.
<P></P> In 1971, Zeigler merged Bell and Zoller and Moffat Coal Company into
the parent corporation, whose name was restored to Zeigler Coal Company.
<P></P>Zeigler's recent past offers a striking echo to its early days. In 1983,
Zeigler Coal Holding Company was formed to acquire coal businesses. It made
Zeigler Coal Company its first purchase in 1985, when current Chairman Mike
Reilly and President and Chief Executive Officer Chand B. Vyas led a group of
managers and investors in a leveraged buyout of the Chicago-based company from
its parent, and moved headquarters south to Fairview Heights, Ill.
<P></P>Today, Zeigler's subsidiaries continue the dream to be safe,
fast-growing, and low-cost coal producers.
<P></P>And we keep surprising the industry.
<P></P>In 1990, Zeigler Coal Holding Company quadrupled its subsidiaries'
production and sales with the acquisition of Old Ben Coal Company from BP
America, then the 20th-largest producer of coal in the United States. In 1992,
Zeigler Coal Company was merged into Old Ben.
<BR>Old Ben's operations date back to the mid-1870s when banker Milford
Buchanan bought Wilmington Star Coal Company in Franklin County, Ill.
<P></P>Old Ben later mined in West Virginia through the Raleigh-Wyoming Coal
Company, which operated through the mid-1950s. Old Ben began operations in
Indiana in 1965 when it purchased Enos Coal Mining Company. In 1968, Old Ben was
acquired by Standard Oil Company of Ohio, and Standard was subsequently
purchased by BP America in 1987.
<P></P>Zeigler reaffirmed its commitment to U.S. coal in November 1992,
completing its purchase of Shell Mining Company.
<P></P>Shell Oil Company, like many other major oil companies, began acquiring
coal reserves in the 1960s to gain access to alternate fuel resources.
<P></P>In 1977, Shell Oil Company acquired the R &amp; F Coal Company in Cadiz,
Ohio. In 1981, Shell Oil began its first grass-roots operation - the Buckskin
Mine - as part of Triton Coal Company in Gillette, Wyo. Shell opened its first
underground mine, the Elkhart Mine of Turris Coal Company near Springfield,
Ill., in 1982.
<P></P>Shell Oil Company formed Shell Mining Company in 1984 to manage its
rapidly growing coal businesses. In 1986, Shell Oil received a 50 percent
interest in A.T. Massey Coal Company, which subsequently became a 100 percent
interest in three major coal producing complexes in Central Appalachia, along
with significant long-term contracts and two coal exporting terminals on the
East Coast.
<P></P>From its beginnings in Franklin County, Ill., Zeigler has grown to be a
leader in the coal industry. It stands today as the largest independent family
of companies devoted to coal and an emerging player in Technology and power. 
<P></P>We don't think Joseph would be surprised. Just mighty proud.

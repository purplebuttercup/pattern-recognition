<CENTER><H2>COAL BY WIRE AND OTHER STRATEGIES FOR MOVING
ALONG THE ELECTRICITY VALUE CHAIN</H2>
</CENTER><P><BR></P>
<P>Thank you George. I'd like to thank the Washington Coal
Club for the opportunity to speak with you today about some
of the changes we at Zeigler are making to place ourselves in
the winners circle in a deregulated electric environment.
</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Those of you who have been familiar with Zeigler Coal
Holding Company in the past, may have been looking at some of
our recent actions, scratching your heads thinking
&quot;Zeigler is a coal company?&quot; Well let me explain
how we view ourselves and our industry to help you understand
some of the paths we have chosen. And I hope you remember the
importance we place on these three five letter words --
clean, cheap power.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Today, Zeigler ranks as one of the nation's largest coal
producers, with a presence in all three major coal producing
regions -- Appalachia, Illinois and the Powder River
Basin.</P>
<P>Our holdings also include extensive land and coal
reserves and two import/export terminals on the east coast,
at Newport News and Charleston. They include a heavy
investment in clean coal technologies, most notably our clean
coal demonstration plant -- ENCOAL -- in the Powder River
Basin. And they include the emerging power segment - our bid
to purchase Cajun Electric, and the launch of our newest
subsidiary, EnerZ Corporation, an energy trading firm.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Looking at our holdings you can see that we believe coal
does not exist in a vacuum. It is part of a chain of economic
value that includes a variety of links: engineering,
construction, mining, energy, transportation, clean coal
technologies, electricity generation, power distribution and,
finally, the end user, the electricity customer. In short,
far from being a discrete industry, coal helps propel an
industry value chain that encompasses nearly 15% of the U.S.
economy.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>But just because coal fuels more electricity in the
United States than all other sources combined, you would be
wrong to think our industry has carved out a dominant market
and margin linkage along this value chain.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Historically, we in the coal industry have allowed
ourselves to be isolated from the value in the rest of this
chain. When there have been problems along the chain, we have
borne the brunt of the pressures. And when there have been
opportunities, we have too often been excluded. The best
example of this lies in coal -- raw energy -- that sells for
about $3 per ton in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming, and
yet can cost an end customer in the eastern part of the
country the equivalent of $100 per ton by the time he plugs
in his microwave or computer.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>The coal industry must change. We at Zeigler have
changed. When regulation forced us to look at coal
differently, we made changes in our company to seek ways to
provide clean, cheap power. </P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Clean coal was once an option. Clean coal was once an
ideal. Today, however, it is real - it is mandatory - and it
is accomplished. Not providing clean coal is no longer
possible. The question is how we do so. And that question,
like so many things, is driven by economics.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Clean cheap power is the result of changes that have
taken place in our industries. The root of these changes come
from regulation.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>These thoughts may seem obvious, but I believe they have
profound implications on how we act. Because whether we are
with a coal company, with a utility, or somewhere else along
the chain, our goal today must not be focused solely on coal.
It must not be focused only on transportation, or generation
or transmission.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>In the 1990s there have been two major changes that have
affected our primary customers and have dramatic implications
for our product.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>From their inception, we have known the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990 would have a dramatic effect on our
business through this decade and beyond. This would come
through strict limits on sulfur dioxide emissions for
utilities in Phase I beginning in 1995, and even tougher
limits in Phase II, beginning in the year 2000.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Our challenge here has been to match our production with
the changing compliance needs of our customers.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>In 1992, Congress passed the Energy Policy Act, which for
the first time enabled states to begin breaking down
territorial monopolies of electric utilities, leading to
so-called &quot;deregulation.&quot; Since that time, the
normally staid utility industry has been undergoing dramatic
changes.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Our challenge here? To develop strategic alliances to
help our customers through this uncertain time.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>A lot of folks forget the original Clean Air Act wasn't
passed in 1990, but in 1970. That passage was predicted to
deal a death-blow to coal... But instead utilities more than
doubled their coal consumption, while sulfur dioxide
emissions have been reduced by more than 50%.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Congress knew the results of the original Clean Air Act
was good... Their own study showed them as much. But in 1990,
they yielded to political pressures and passed the Clean Air
Act Amendments.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>This unnecessary regulation has left utilities with
essentially three choices for compliance:
</P>
<P> </P>
<P>They can burn high-sulfur coal, and install scrubbers;
<P> </P>
<P>They can switch to low-sulfur coal; or</P>
<P> </P>
<P>They can burn higher-sulfur coal and offset those with
emissions credits, which are traded on the open market.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Let's now turn our attention to deregulation, which I
believe will have significantly broader ramifications for our
customers than even the Clean Air Act.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Deregulation is traditionally a dirty word for
industries. It conjures up images of price wars, uncertainty
and shrinking margins. That's why it might surprise you to
know that we at Zeigler areexcited about competing in an
environment in which our customers are deregulated.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>This optimism grows from a simple equation. Coal, year-in
and year-out, has been the least-cost baseload fuel. Fuel is
the largest cost component for utilities. And utilities will
now have an incentive to compete on the basis of price.
Coal's favorable cost structure will continue to position us
favorably vis a vis other fuels, protecting and perhaps
increasing coal's sizable market share.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>I say this for two reasons. The first is fairly obvious:
a utility with, say, a troubled nuclear investment, has
traditionally been able to pass along the higher rates to
customers without regard for efficiency. The new marketplace,
however, will have patience neither for so-called
&quot;troubled&quot; plants, nor for subsidizing
pie-in-the-sky fuels like solar and windmills. We see
nuclear's market share shrinking from its number two position
now, at 21%, to less than 10% in the next 15 years. Coal
stands ready to compete for that market share.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>The second reason has to do with reserve capacity.
Utilities in the past have been generally rewarded on
invested capital, and not on operating efficiencies. As a
result, coal-fired baseload plants today run at an average of
only 55 to 60% capacity. We believe that utilization could
increase by 20 percentage points, and such an increase would
account for a 250-million-ton-per-year boost in coal demand,
absent any new coal-fired plants that could come on line.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Our industry will fare well within this environment, and
we continue to leverage our position by continuing to build
strategic customer alliances. Let me offer you several
examples of what I'm referring to. They offer a good glimpse
of the future... And how Zeigler is positioning ourselves -
and our customers - to prevail within this new environment.
</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>The first model comes from a long-term customer with whom
we reached agreement by establishing a two-tier pricing
structure that involves both a per-ton pricing as well as
semi-regular lump sum payments over the life of the contract.
Doing this allows them a second tier of costs that may be
recouped under possible stranded investment recovery
mechanisms.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>The second model involves a pure partnering relationship
that goes beyond traditional request-bid arrangements. It
comes from a utility in Illinois which, largely as a result
of its low-cost fuel from our operations, has joined one of
the many exchanges that now broker electricity. As a result,
the utility has opportunities for specific sales on the power
grid, and we are their sole partner in offering on-the-spot
coal quotes that enable them to make the best bids to gain
this incremental business. If the deal makes sense for both
parties, we make it. Otherwise, we don't.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>The third model involves our Encoal process - the R&amp;D
project I referred to earlier which XXXXX the BTU and leaves
the sulphur from already low sulfur coal. Encoal was
conceived with the thought of providing cleaner coal for
utilities burning midwest coal at full capacity but unable to
handle the derating that could come about from a switch to
Powder River Basin coals. This could still be the
case -
but we also believe Encoal has strategic positioning within a
deregulated environment for utilities running PRB coals at
full capacity and wanting a btu boost without adding
expensive extra capacity. </P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>The fourth model, falls into pure &quot;wheeling&quot;
concepts. Recently, we have been told by some of our
customers: &quot;give us your best price on coal going to the
closest low-cost utility with excess capacity... And we'll
buy your coal by buying their power.&quot; This approach...
Referred to as &quot;coal by wire&quot; will become
increasingly important as transmission lines become the coal
carriers of the next century.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Let's explore the coal by wire theory a bit further.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>We believe that because the rules of electricity are
changing, coal transportation will come in different forms in
the future. And one new premise is that coal may be more
economical to transport once it is combusted.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Domestically, I am not at all convinced that railroads
will continue to be the transportation of choice for
electricity fuel. As utilities break down geographic barriers
and for the first time focus on low-cost competition through
deregulation, I see strong potential for the transportation
of coal by wire. </P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Zeigler intends to be a winner in its exploration of coal
by wire concepts, letting utilities transport coal in its
combusted state, via transmission lines, versus traditional
rail transport.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>The fifth model relates to our current offer to purchase
the non-nuclear assets of Cajun Electric out of bankruptcy.
Some have said that, while they know of utilities buying coal
mines, this is the first time a coal company has made a bid
for a significant utility. We are doing so to align ourselves
more closely with our end customer, grow along strategic
links of the electricity value chain, and satisfy the mandate
of those three words again: &quot;Clean Cheap
Power.&quot;</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>And finally, the sixth model involves EnerZ Corporation.
This fall, Zeigler announced the launch of EnerZ Corporation
to take advantage of emerging market opportunities growing
out of utility deregulation. Since that time, EnerZ has
opened a New York City office and received approval from the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for status as a
wholesale power marketer. Leading EnerZ is Tayeb Tahir, who
has extensive expertise helping utilities and gas companies
create and operate energy trading groups. And I am proud to
report that within the last copule of weeks (even before we
moved into our Newy York Office) EnerZ has in fact made
several trades.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>One thing that will, we believe, help us with EnerZ, is
that Zeigler itself brings to the table a natural long
position in coal and annually fuels more than 50 billion
kilowatt hours of power in the U.S., Or nearly 2 percent of
the total.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>Whereas in the past Zeigler could only sell its coal to a
utility customer over an industrial company, tomorrow we may
be in the position of not only providing the fuel supplies,
but the end customer for the power. Another likely scenario
is the potential of purchasing excess generating capacity at
a coal-fired plant, paying the generator to burn our coal,
and selling the power to the end customer.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>These are just a few of the possibilities we see
unfolding with EnerZ, as we position ourselves for a fully
deregulated energy marketplace -- a marketplace where Clean,
Cheap Power will prevail.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>These new models which I have discussed with you this
afternoon portray the rapidly changing environment in which
we operate... And how we at Zeigler are positioning ourselves
to respond to this changing environment by being a supplier
of Clean, Cheap Power. For those of you who have been
scratching your heads wondering what Zeigler &quot;the coal
company&quot; has been up to, I hope I've cured your itch. We
have worked hard and had the good fortune to complete a
dramatic transformation of our company in the face of a fast
growing deregulated electric environment.</P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>At this time, I would like to open up the floor to any
questions you may have. </P>
<P> <BR> </P>
<P>And once again thank you for having me as your guest
today. </P>

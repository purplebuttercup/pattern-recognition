Zeigler is evaluating several different mechanisms by which it can participate in high return potential international ventures:
<BR><BR>
<B>Privatization </B>- In eastern Europe, Poland, Hungary, Turkey, India and Australia, governments are evaluating the privatization of coal production and electric power generation. Zeigler's expertise and financial resources position it well to take part in these activities.
<BR><BR>
<B>Independent Power Projects </B>- Countries with indigenous coal reserves and shortages of power plants and mining include China, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, India, Colombia, Venezuela, and Mexico. While not seeking sole control of operations in these sites, Zeigler's expertise makes the company a viable partner for locally driven development activities in which the company can bring to bear our skills in efficient mining while taking an equity interest in integrated power projects.
<BR><BR>
<B>LFC Investment </B>- The TEK-KOL partnership, in which Zeigler is a 50 percent owner, is in discussions regarding licensing of full-scale Liquids From Coal (LFC) plants overseas. To date, TEK-KOL's Development Center in Ohio has tested and analyzed 10 domestic and 21 foreign coals to determine the most promising candidate coals for LFC processing. As a result of these tests, letters of intent for engineering and economic assessments of full-scale commercial plants are currently in place with entities in Indonesia, Russia and China.
<BR><BR>
<B>Contract Mining </B>- We understand that it is not always possible or preferable to take equity positions in mining ventures. On both a domestic and global front, Zeigler sees opportunities to utilize our strong coal mining expertise in a contract role. Zeigler's mines are among the most efficient in the nation, and U.S. mining in general is the safest, most efficient and productive in the world. Similar to other industries, as the need for safe, low-cost coal grows with the demands for inexpensive power, Zeigler stands ready to provide value-added services.

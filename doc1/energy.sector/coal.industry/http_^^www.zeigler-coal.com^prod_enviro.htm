Zeigler believes the environmental and engineering industries offer exciting opportunities to add shareholder value utilizing existing expertise. Three areas currently being explored include environmental services, engineering and construction and industrial development.
<BR><BR>
Zeigler has had experience and opportunity managing environmental issues, including land and water reclamation as well as waste disposal, clean-up and transportation. In 1996, Zeigler began evaluating a greater entree into environmental services. Based on this review, we intend to grow environmental services onto an emerging profit center in 1997.
<BR><BR>
Coal mines are among the largest engineered structures on earth, so it is not surprising that we are leveraging our core competencies here to begin developing a successful engineering and construction business unit.
<BR><BR>
The first major project in this emerging segment is the Phoenix Commerce Center, a 500-acre industrial park we are developing in southern Indiana on land already owned by Zeigler. We have begun soliciting tenants for the park, which would be the largest in southern Indiana and located within 20 miles of a truck manufacturing plant now under construction. We are evaluating other, similar opportunities.

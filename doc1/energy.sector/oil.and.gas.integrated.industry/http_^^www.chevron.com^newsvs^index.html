message[4]="<CENTER><B>Peter J. Robertson<BR>President Chevron U.S.A. Production Company<BR>to the Tulane University Business Forum New Orleans, Louisiana</B></CENTER><P>Good morning and thanks for inviting me to participate in this forum.  It's a pleasure to be here.  New Orleans is one of Chevron's major employee population centers.  And it's one of those places that I love returning to. It seems there's always a reason to celebrate here.  Maybe those of us in the business community could learn something from that.";
message[5]="<CENTER><B>Kenneth T. Derr<BR>Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Chevron Corporation<BR>to the World Petroleum Congress, Beijing, China</B></CENTER><P>It's a privilege to be here in Beijing to talk about our industry and to honor the memory of Thomas Dewhurst, the father of the World Petroleum Congress.  Mr. Dewhurst passed away in 1973.  So he never witnessed the Arab oil embargo of that year or what happened to oil prices in the years that followed.  If he were with us today, I think he would be proud that our industry has spent the 1990s learning how to be successful without high oil prices -- and proving we don't need high oil prices in order to grow the industry.<P>";

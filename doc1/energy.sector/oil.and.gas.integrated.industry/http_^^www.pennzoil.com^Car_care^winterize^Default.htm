With that thought in mind, it is a good idea to properly prepare these vehicles for the cold. Properpreventative maintenance can help to avoid potentially dangerous vehicleproblems.<P>Performing this type of preventative maintenance will reduce the chancesof your winter driving being interrupted by vehicle problems. What's more,you'll probably extend the life of your vehicle.  Have a safe winter drivingseason.<P><A NAME="HE"></A><B>Heater</B> -  You wouldn't want your heater to fail during a long cold winter. Invery cold areas, where cold fronts, accompanied by blizzard-like conditionsoccur, the loss of your heater can be much more than just an inconvenience.Heater hoses and their connections should be checked before the onset of coldweather.<BR><FONT SIZE=2><A HREF="../../products/frigc/default.htm">Learn about our cost-effectiveFreon&#174; alternative</A>.</FONT><P><A NAME="AF"></A><B>Air Filter</B> - If your air filter has not been changed recently, this is a goodtime to do so. <BR><FONT SIZE=2><A HREF="../../products/filters/default.htm">Click here for more information aboutour filter products</A>.</FONT><P><A NAME="BH"></A><B>Belts &amp; Hoses</B> -  It's a good idea to check all belts and hoses before wintersets in. Belts should be checked for proper tension and wear. Either replacequestionable belts or carry spares and the tools to install them. Check hosesfor wear and tear. Replace any that look questionable. To be needlesslystranded, in the dead of winter because of a hose or belt problem, ispotentially dangerous.<P><A NAME="AFC"></A><B>Antifreeze-Coolant</B> -  As winter approaches, one of the most important thingsyou can do for your car is check the antifreeze. Most manufacturers recommenda 50:50 mixture of antifreeze to water which will provide protection againstfreezing down to -35 degrees F. Antifreeze content is easily measured with afloat hydrometer. If your coolant has not been changed in the last two years,it is a good idea to drain the old coolant for proper disposal and replacewith a fresh mixture. Antifreeze, while very stable, will degrade over time.When it degrades, its ability to protect your engine diminishes.<BR><FONT SIZE=2><A HREF="../../products/specialty/antifreeze/default.htm">Click here for more information aboutour antifreeze</A>.</FONT><P><A NAME="BT"></A><B>Battery</B> - One of the most common cold weather problems is battery failure. Asa battery ages, its ability to provide adequate current at low temperaturesdecreases. Thus, it is possible for a battery to appear to behave normally inwarm weather and then fail to crank after sitting overnight in coldtemperatures. Be sure to check the fluid level in each cell of a non-sealedbattery and check for proper charge. No one wants to be stranded due to adead battery.<P><A NAME="BK"></A><B>Brakes</B> - Examine the brake pads and/or shoes for remaining life. it's easierto replace brakes locally than on the road. While examining the brake system,make sure to check the brake fluid level. As most brake fluids are glycolbased, they absorb water over time, through brake system seals, hoses andcaps. If the water level reaches a significant concentration, a hot runningbrake system can boil the brake fluid, forming a compressible vapor in thebrake line, which in severe cases can cause spongy brakes or brake failure.Do not ignore proper brake fluid maintenance. And be sure to install theproper fluid. Contamination with the wrong product can lead to brake systemfailure.<BR><FONT SIZE=2><A HREF="../../products/specialty/default.htm">Click here for more information aboutour brake fluid products</A>.</FONT><P><A NAME="LS"></A><B>Lubrication System</B> -  Before any long trip, it is a good idea to change engineoil and filter, as well as performing any routine chassis and generallubrication. Some vehicles require changes in motor oil viscosity grades incolder weather from those recommended in warm weather. Be sure to check yourowner's manual for the proper viscosity grade. The vast majority of latemodel American and Japanese cars and light trucks list 5W-30 and l0W-30 asthe only recommended viscosity grades for all-temperature service.<BR><FONT SIZE=2><A HREF="../../products/passenger/multigrade/default.htm">Click here for more information aboutour oil &amp; fluid products</A>.</FONT><P><A NAME="TR"></A><B>Tires</B> - Before any trip, check for adequate remaining tread and adjust forthe recommended pressure. Proper pressure will not only increase the life ofa tire, but will improve fuel economy as well, which can be very important ona long trip. Always check tire pressure when the tires are cold. Be sure tocheck the spare also.<P><A NAME="UTH"></A><B>Under-the-Hood Fluids</B>  -  Check the fluid levels not previously mentioned,including the power steering fluid reservoir, windshield washer reservoir,automatic transmission, manual gearbox, and differential(s). Investigate anyunexplained fluid losses.<BR><FONT SIZE=2><A HREF="../../products/default.htm">Click here for more information aboutour fluid products</A>.</FONT><P><A NAME="WIW"></A><B>Windshield Wipers</B>  - The time to check wiper blades is just before and afterwinter. Winter driving in sleet, snow and ice is the toughest punishment thatyour wiper blades will ever see. Having old worn blades at the onset ofwinter could lead to dangerous driving conditions should you encounter anybad weather.<P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=BOTTOM><IMG SRC="graphics/caution.gif" ALT="Caution" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="194" BORDER="0">                 </TD></TR></TABLE>	</TD></TR></TABLE><BR><MAP NAME="navmap"><AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="323,0 610,16" HREF="../../racing/default.htm"><AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="104,0 207,15" HREF="../../products/default.htm"><AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="212,0 319,16" HREF="../default.htm"><AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="0,0 99,15" HREF="../../default.htm"></MAP><TABLE WIDTH=600 BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0><TR>	<TD BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">		<IMG SRC="../../graphics/navigation/carnavbar.gif" ALT="Car Care Navigation" 		WIDTH=596 HEIGHT=16 BORDER=0 USEMAP="#navmap"></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR><BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING WIDTH=600><TR>	<TD WIDTH=600 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=-2>&#169;1997, Pennzoil Products Company, All Rights Reserved</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>

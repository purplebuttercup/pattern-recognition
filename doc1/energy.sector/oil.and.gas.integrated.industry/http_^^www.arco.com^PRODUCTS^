<P>
 ARCO Products is a leading retailer of gasoline on the West Coast
with more than 1,500 branded retail outlets in California, Oregon,
Washington, Arizona, and Nevada.
<P>
 ARCO Products operates two U.S. petroleum refineries: the Los Angeles Refinery in Carson, Calif. and the Cherry Point Refinery near Ferndale, Wash.   Both of these refineries are accessible to major supply sources and major markets through marine tankers and pipelines.  <A HREF="marine.html">ARCO Marine</A> is a unit of ARCO Products Company.
<P>
 ARCO Products operates a number of businesses ancillary to its
refining and fuels marketing operations.  Automobile gasolines
produced by ARCO Products, for example, are sold primarily at am/pm&#174;
convenience-store and <A HREF="http://www.arco.com/SMOGPROS/">SMOGPROS&#174; 
</A>sites, in addition to traditional
ARCO-branded service stations.  ARCO Products is the leader in
the gas-station convenience-store business under the am/pm&#174;
brand name, with the highest convenience-store penetration in
the gasoline marketing industry.   It is also the number one marketer
of jet fuel in the West and the leading domestic producer and
exporter in the U.S. of calcined coke.  ARCO Products also has
the largest cogeneration operation in the West.
<P>
 ARCO Products has been a leader and an innovator in reformulated
gasoline since 1989 when it introduced EC-1, the first emission-control
gasoline.  ARCO Products was instrumental in establishing reformulated
gasoline's role as the primary fuel for both the federal Clean
Air Act and California Air Resources Board regulations.

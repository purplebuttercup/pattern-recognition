<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We have designed a site which may be used with all Web client software.
However, this site is optimized for versions 3.0 or later of Microsoft
Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, which presently offers the
most features for attractive design. If some of the pages contain
anomalies in their appearance, it is probably because your browser
cannot understand all of the formatting. Alternative pages are offered
for viewing by browsers that are less rich in features. 
<P>
Much of our content is highly graphical, and could not be adequately
represented in 16-color graphics. Therefore, to accurately view most of
the graphics, please set your monitor to 256 colors (or better), if
possible. 
<P>
For information about strategic design, construction and programming,

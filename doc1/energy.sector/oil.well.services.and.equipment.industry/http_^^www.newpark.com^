<H2>Company Profile</H2>
<P>
<B>Newpark Resources, Inc</B>. is traded on the NYSE under the
ticker symbol 'NR'.<BR>
<P>
Newpark Resources provides comprehensive oilfield waste management,
drilling fluids and site construction services to the oil and
gas industry.  The company provides temporary work sites and related
access roads necessary to support the heavy loads involved in
oil and gas drilling operations.  These sites are constructed
using Newpark's patented pre-fabricated wooden mats, which interlock
with each other to transfer the concentrated load presented by
a drilling rig or other heavy equipment over a large surface area
to ensure stability and safety in all weather conditions.  Newpark
also provides drilling fluids and other chemicals used in drilling
for oil and gas, and removes and disposes of waste created in
the oil and gas drilling and production processes.<BR>
<P>
During the past 12 months, Newpark Resources, Inc. has reshaped
itself to take advantage of consolidation and integration opportunities
available within its primary markets.  The first phase of this
process was initiated by the August 1996 acquisition of the marine
related nonhazardous oilfield waste collection operations of its'
largest competitor, which consolidated the majority of the Gulf
Coast waste market and was a key step to improving margins in
this important business line.  The second phase began with a February
1997 acquisition that marked the Company's return to the Gulf
Coast drilling fluids business by consolidating several industry
participants to build critical mass in the market place.  Phase
three, which has already begun, includes integration of the six
fluids related companies acquired, consolidation of purchasing
and distribution functions, and reduction of raw materials cost,
all of which will improve margins.  The final stage of the process
is the recycling of fluids received in the Company's NOW operations
as a raw material for drilling fluids, which will further build
margins in that business.  This process will extend throughout
1998.<BR>
<P>
Newpark is well positioned to benefit from expected increases
in drilling activity in the Gulf Coast, and from continuing regulatory
pressure restricting discharges of drilling and production waste
into surface waters of the U.S.  Newpark is in the process of
expanding its patented injection disposal process into other waste
markets, including nonhazardous industrial waste.  The Company
expects to expand its drilling fluids and waste disposal operations
beyond its historic Gulf Coast base and into international market.
<BR>
<P>
The Company has established a position in the site services market
in Venezuela in anticipation of a growing market in that country,
and has initiated operations in Algeria in support of increased
exploration activity in that market.  Newpark has developed a
patented, synthetic mat system made from recycled plastic, which
is lighter, stronger, and cost competitive with existing mats.
 The Company expects that these new mats will facilitate entry
into new governmental, military and emergency response markets.

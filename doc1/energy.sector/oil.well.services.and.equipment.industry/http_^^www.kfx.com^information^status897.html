<P>We have received numerous inquiries about the status of the commercial plant and our plans to further the technology.  We are providing this update to answer those questions.</P>

<P>Gillette Commercial Plant Status Report:</P>
</B></U><P>
<UL>
<LI>Fire on December 24, 1996, was caused by faulty installation of pipes in hot oil heater.</LI>
<LI>Two processors remained available for testing.</LI>
<LI>Some flowability and other startup problems were encountered.</LI>
<LI>Fixes for the flowability installed in two units, with the other two to be completed in 30 days.</LI>
<LI>91 runs were made with the two available units.</LI>
<LI>The compacted product test pile has been stable for 83 days.</LI>
<LI>Fire damage reconstruction is complete and the systems are now being tested.  Damage, including delayed startup costs, was fully insured.</LI>
<LI>With the plant still under contractor’s control and before turnover to KFP, TCK requested a punch list safety and environmental review.</LI>
<LI>At the point when successful runs in units 1 &amp; 2 were achieved, the audit discovered engineering miscalculations on venting equipment valves in the system.</LI>
<LI>Of the series of consecutive runs performed prior to the discovery of the engineering error, several produced quality K-Fuel product of 12,200-12,600 Btu.</LI>
<LI>The solution to the engineering errors is estimated to take approximately 12 weeks.  All costs and damages are the contractor’s responsibility.</LI>
<LI>TCK and KFx are taking this time to make some improvements to the system to enhance the operating efficiency and performance of the plant.</LI>
<LI>None of the construction or engineering problems are the result of the technology.</LI>
<LI>It has been demonstrated that K-Fuel can be produced in the facility.</LI>
<LI>No losses, no material holdup or effect to KFx has occurred.  The fundamentals of the technology are proven sound.</LI></UL>
<P><B><U><P>Corporate Status Report:</P>
</B></U><P>
<UL>
<LI> KFx is prepared to construct the first activated carbon plant using the Koppelman process.  Technology has been verified by Hazen Research and construction engineering is proceeding.</LI>
<LI>KFx is in the engineering and permit phase of the 5th processor.</LI>
<LI>K-Fuel LLC has designed and is pricing the 3 million TPY plant for Indonesia.  Final conceptual design (including three new patents assigned to KFx from Kennecott) has been determined.</LI>
<LI>With the KFP plant nearing completion, KFx can now substantially reduce overhead and R&amp;D expenditures.</LI>
<LI>The Corporate objective is to be cash positive by year-end 1998. </LI>
<LI>Having funded the debentures, KFx will:</LI>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>Continue development of the 5<SUP>th</SUP> processor</LI>
<LI>Pursue alternate investment opportunities – i.e., existing plant</LI>
<LI>Construct an activated carbon plant</LI>
<LI>Aggressively work to close the Indonesian project</LI>
<LI>Demonstrate compaction system for Turkish project</LI>
<LI>Prepare a financing package for the Turkish project</LI>
<LI>Continue to develop large-scale K-Fuel plants worldwide through the LLC with Kennecott</LI>

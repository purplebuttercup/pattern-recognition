<p><b>PETROLEUM HELICOPTERS, INC. ANNOUNCES RESULTS OF PILOT
UNIONIZATION ELECTION</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>NEW ORLEANS, LA<font face="Symbol">¾</font> September 4, 1997<font
face="Symbol">¾</font> Petroleum Helicopters, Inc. (PHI)
announced today that its pilots have voted to reject union
representation. Five hundred ninety-six (596) pilots were
eligible to vote: 58% supported the Company and 42% favored
Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU)
representation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Company has maintained that representation by a union was
not in the best interest of its employees or the Company.
&quot;Today&#146;s vote was a most important event in the history
of PHI. It is very gratifying to know that our pilots are
supportive of the mission and goals of our great Company,&quot;
said Mrs. Carroll W. Suggs, Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer. &quot;I want to thank everyone at PHI who
helped us to meet this challenge, and I look forward to working
closely with all of our employees in the future to ensure that
PHI maintains its position as the world&#146;s preeminent
helicopter company and a great place to work.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PHI provides helicopter transportation and related services
worldwide to a broad range of customers including the oil and gas
industry and aeromedical programs. PHI Common Stock is traded on
The NASDAQ SmallCap Market (symbols PHEL and PHELK).</p>

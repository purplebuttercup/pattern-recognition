	<I>SMART</I> way</b></font>
	<p>
    In-stock platform components means you're on-line fast!<br>
	Tarpon Systems has developed the fastest way to bring your 
	marginal field on-line with minimal up front costs. We call
	it the <B>SMART</B> Program......Stocked Marginal And 
	Reusable Tarpon platforms, ready for installation when you 
	are.<p>
	In conjunction with several quality manufacturers, we have 
	stockpiled all platform components necessary for marginal 
	field developments between 70-300 feet of water and beyond. 
	Multiple systems are available with caisson stock sizes of 
	66" to 96" diameter. Stocked components include:
	<ul>
	<li>CAISSONS
	<li>BOAT LANDINGS
	<li>ANCHOR PILINGS
	<li>STEEL GUY CABLES
	<li>DECKS
	<li>ROD & BLOCK ASSEMBLIES
	<li>HELIDECKS
	<li>CONDUCTOR AND RISER CLAMPS
	</ul>

	<B>How does this benefit you?</B>
	<p>
    This program allows you to incorporate the Tarpon platform
	into your drilling program. Mudline suspended wells and 
	additional rig mobilizations can be eliminated contributing 
	to savings of $500,000 or more in up front costs.
	<p>
  	Upon order, these pre-fabricated components are assembled 
	to site specific parameters and mobilized for installation 
	within 7-10 days, significantly reducing your time to 
	production. No other traditional platform alternatives offer 
	you this rapid deployment capability and early cash flow 
	opportunity.

<h2 align="center"><i>Petroleum Helicopters Inc.</i></h2>

<h3 align="center"><i>The Total Helicopter Company</i></h3>

<hr size="1">

<p align="left"><font face="arial">Petroleum Helicopters Inc. (PHI) had its beginning in
February, 1949. With the emergence of the offshore oil and gas industry, seismograph crews
were battling their way though a foreboding stretch of Louisiana marsh and swamp land.
Using ground vehicles (marsh buggies) was a very slow, arduous and dangerous way to
traverse this type of terrain. Out of desperation, the late Jack Lee, a seismographic
company president, envisioned the helicopter as an alternative transportation solution. He
then approached Robert L. Suggs and M. M. Bayon and purchased three Bell 47 helicopters.
Their &quot;fleet&quot; of three small helicopters soon proved that rotary-wing aircraft
was a feasible solution to the<img src="graphics\bell47_1.gif" align="right" hspace="0" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="119">
problem. The company began with an investment of $100,000, eight employees and three Bell
47 helicopters and the belief that helicopters would play a major role in the future of
transportation in the industry. PHI was built on a strong commitment to safety, quality
and reliability and continually directed to customer service.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="arial">Today, PHI still embodies these basic principles.
Almost fifty years later, the company has grown to become the world&#146;s largest and
most experienced commercial helicopter operator. With a fleet of 315 aircraft, larger than
most competitors worldwide, PHI offers services to the offshore oil, onshore mining, <a href="intern01.htm">International</a>, <a href="phiems.htm">Aeromedical</a>, and <a href="phits.htm">Technical Services </a>industries. The highly skilled staff of pilots and
mechanics gives the company great depth in all areas of operation. The average tenure of
employment is 15 years, and the company is proud of the dedication and commitment of their
employees. In total, the company has over 1850 full time employees working at 45 domestic
and 11 foreign bases. The PHI team is composed of the most courageous, highly skilled,
dedicated, hard-working and loyal employees in the world. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="arial">PHI has a long history of operating in the Global
Marketplace. In addition to North America, the company has operated in 38 foreign
countries, to include Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean. Current
domestic areas of operation include: 600 miles of coastal waters along the Gulf of Mexico
from Texas to Florida and California.&nbsp; International locations are Angola, Ecuador,
Columbia, Peru, the Philippines, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Vietnam, and Zaire.
The company uses a broad range of joint ventures, partnerships and strategic alliances
with customers and other operators to provide services to those parts of the world. PHI's
helicopters operate 200 miles into the Gulf of Mexico and to locations 185 miles offshore
in international waters. PHI's Headquarters are in Lafayette, Louisiana, USA, where daily
operations are conducted in conjunction with 45 other PHI heliports nationwide.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="arial">PHI provides service to the Healthcare industry through
its <a href="phiems.htm">Aeromedical Services Division</a>. Since its inception in 1981,
Aeromedical Services has grown from one medically equipped helicopter to thirty-six
helicopters with state of the art medical interiors designed and constructed by PHI. The
current customer list spans the United States and includes customers that are very visible
in the Healthcare industry. PHI Aeromedical Services is currently providing services that
were previously not available from civilian helicopter operators. Along with PHI&#146;s
safety record, Aeromedical Services&#146; safety record has been without peers since its
inception.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="arial">Not surprisingly, helicopter manufacturers work closely
with PHI and have adopted many of it modifications and other technological improvements.
As an example, one manufacturer chose PHI's stretcher design for aeromedically configured
helicopters. PHI also has been instrumental in the development and certification of
offshore navigation equipment. Additionally, over the 48 year history of PHI, the company
has become the industry leader in maintenance, technology, and overall operations. Their
overhaul and maintenance facility based in Lafayette, Louisiana, USA is considered by many
to be the premier facility in the world because of its technology and experienced staff.
PHI employees conduct routine maintenance and repair work; completely overhaul engines and
airframes; operate a state-of-the-art painting facility; study and engineer new parts and
lubricants; research new procedures; develop new techniques; and maintain a multi-million
dollar inventory, all of which are required to operate the world's largest fleet of
commercial helicopters.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="arial">In addition, PHI has developed state-of-the-art
medically configured interiors for hospital and medical customers nationwide. Throughout
the efforts of the engineering department and the maintenance staff, they have provided
interiors which allow the helicopter to operate as a flying ambulance and enable the
medical personnel to perform procedures and provide services that previously were only
available in a hospital.</font></p>

<hr size="1">

<p align="left"><font face="arial"><left> Throughout the company&#146;s 47 years of aviation
leadership, there have been many accomplishments, &quot;firsts&quot; and superlatives that
have occurred which have changed the aviation industry. A partial list of those
accomplishments is listed below. PHI has always been known as the innovative and
technological leader in the industry, and the statements listed below display the depth of
that ideology.</font></p>

<h4 align="center"><font face="arial">FROM THE ROUTINE TO THE RARE</font></h4>

<p align="left"><font face="arial">Each day, PHI crews routinely provide fast, economical
transportation of men and women, equipment and supplies to offshore sites, hospitals and
other facilities, worldwide. From transferring a supervisor or a vital drilling rig part
to changing an entire drilling crew, a PHI helicopter today does the job in about
one-fifth of the time required by boat transportation. With the company&#146;s advanced
maintenance capabilities, PHI is able to provide each customer 98% availability of
aircraft everyday. Valuable time and money are saved in the helicopter support of distant
offshore operations, and the men and women who work at those locations work with the
confidence that they are only a few minutes away from helicopter help, should they become
sick, injured or in the case of a hazardous weather conditions.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="arial">Apart from its normal operations, PHI has also become
famous for other humanitarian aspects of its business. For example, employee groups known
as &quot;advisory committees&quot; regularly query top management about a wide variety of
PHI working conditions, business ventures and future plans.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="arial">PHI crews have rescued hundreds of persons from the
perils of floods, storms and other disasters. Its helicopter crews lifted 216 people from
rooftops and trees in Puerto Rico when Hurricane Donna devastated that country. Always
available for emergency use in the areas where they operate, PHI helicopters and employees
have flown Red Cross relief personnel to disaster sites, supported rescue operations and
flown public officials to survey the damaged areas. PHI rescues are as varied as they are
numerous; and the company prides itself on continuously striving to be a corporate example
to their employees and the areas where they operate.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="arial"><b><i>PHI is the Total Helicopter Company.</i></b> As
the offshore oil and gas industry moves further out into the Gulf of Mexico, the
aeromedical industry gets more advanced and as International arenas open, PHI plans to be
able to meet the needs of all customers in all locations. PHI provides customers with the
safest, most reliable helicopter transportation in the world and they are prepared to move
anywhere their services are needed. As the largest helicopter company in the world, PHI
has the ability to expand and grow which allows for greater flexibility and improved
service. Thus, as the industry progresses into the 21st century, PHI is primed for any
challenge.</font></p>

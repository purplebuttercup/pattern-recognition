        Safety Philosophy</u></font></h3>
        <p><font size="2">The Tidewater Inc. safety philosophy is
        that the health and welfare of its people are among the
        most important considerations in any undertaking.
        Additionally, the protection of company assets and the
        environment are also primary concerns. No job is so
        important that we cannot take the time to do it properly
        and complete it safely. This philosophy better enables
        Tidewater to deliver the highest quality services to its
        customers and the best performance for its shareholders.</font></p>

        <td valign="top" width="50%"><font size="2">It is
        Tidewater's aim to: provide a place of employment which
        is free from recognized hazards; provide accident
        prevention programs and systems; and comply with
        applicable national and international regulations.
        Understanding that safety, accident prevention and
        environmental protection are operational
        responsibilities, this philosophy requires all employees
        at all levels to be responsible for the prevention of
        job-related injuries and illnesses, property damage and
        environmental accidents through the use of good judgment
        and the diligent and consistent application of company
        guidelines and procedures. Employee safety performance
        will always be a major consideration in decisions
        affecting promotions, salary actions and continued
        employment. </font></td>

<p align="left"><font size="2">Tidewater Inc. believes its
employees are the greatest asset of the company. Tidewater is
committed to providing its employees with the safest working
environment and the highest level of training possible.<br>
</font></p>

<h3 align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="2">VESSELS</font></h3>

<p align="left"><font size="2">Tidewater aggressively inspects
its vessels to insure not only compliance with applicable law but
also a safe workplace. One component of this process currently
being implemented in the U.S. is the Streamlined Inspection
Program (SIP), designed to insure that all Tidewater vessels are
in full compliance with the United States Coast Guard inspection
standards. Tidewater has enhanced this program through training
to raise the awareness of every employee as it relates to vessel
equipment preparedness.</font></p>

<h3 align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="2">PEOPLE</font></h3>

<p align="left"><font size="2">Tidewater is in full compliance
with the current Standard for Training, Certification and
Watchkeeping (STCW), which requires that employees must be
familiar with safe working practices and emergency response
procedures, and competent in implementing such procedures.</font></p>

<h3 align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="2">PROGRAMS</font></h3>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">Tidewater recently
developed and implemented a Safe Operations System (SOS). This
system is a complete guide to policies, practices and procedures
and contains information ranging from corporate standards to
day-to-day operations. This system was also drafted with
International safety Management (ISM) Code certification in mind.
Already, the Alaska and West Coast Operations have received ISM
certification and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico anticipates
certification in mid-1998. This certification process will
continue until all operating areas around the world are fully
ISM-certified.</font></p>

<h3 align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="2">THE BOTTOM LINE</font></h3>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">Tidewater empowers
its employees with the authority to review work practices so that
we can work accident-free; that's our goal. We believe that
properly trained employees with clearly defined career paths and
the power to control their environment will protect themselves,
their vessels and their customers. This means better people,
lower costs and the highest quality service available.</font></p>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Thomas G. Finck</FONT><i><BR>
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</i><P>

We are entering a time of unparalleled opportunity for large independent oil and gas companies 
gearing up to do international exploration. Outside the United States, oil and gas companies with capital to fund exploration programs can participate in significant discoveries that are characterized as having excellent cash-flow margins and long-life reserves. Triton's focused strategy of exploring for large oil and gas fields, what we call "elephant-hunting," fits this pattern. We can use these large field discoveries as building blocks to create a substantial company, one geared to deliver exceptional value to its partners, investors and suppliers.
<P>

There are several keys to successful international exploration. First, have a large, multi-play acreage inventory. Triton has an inventory of more than 35 million prospective acres located in 13 countries. This large acreage position provides us multiple future drilling opportunities, although we will continue to add to this acreage position over time.<P>


Second, establish strong relationships with host countries. At Triton, we establish personal relationships with senior government officials and business leaders in countries in which we invest. We learn the history, language and culture of each country, as well as learn about the political and economic environment. Triton makes a point of hiring and training local talent to better integrate the Company into the community.<P>


Third, we use the best technology available and the best people to use it. We take no shortcuts in our approach to quality operations. We are proud to compare our technical and financial expertise with any organization in our industry.

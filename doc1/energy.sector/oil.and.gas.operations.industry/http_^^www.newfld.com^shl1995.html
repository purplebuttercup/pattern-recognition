It is a test we believe every corporation's stockholders should expect their company's management to pass.Our scorecard for 1995 is as follows:</p><center><br><Table border=1><tr><td width=140><b>At Year End:</b></td><td align=center><b>1995</td><td align=center><b>1994</td><td align=center><b>% Change</td></tr><tr><td>Market price per share</td><td align=right>$27.00</td><td align=right>$20.00</td><td align=right>+35%</td></tr><tr><td>Book value per share</td><td align=right>$10.70</td><td align=right>$9.44</td><td align=right>+13%</td></tr><tr><td>SEC10 value less long-term debt per share</td><td align=right>$18.50</td><td align=right>$12.84</td><td align=right>+44%</td></tr><tr><td>Reserves per share, Mcfe*</td><td align=right> 27.00</td><td align=right> 20.00</td><td align=right>+35%</td></tr><tr><td><b>For the Year:</b></td><td align=right><b>1995</td><td align=right><b>1994</td><td align=right></td></tr><tr><td>Net income per share</td><td align=right>$0.90</td><td align=right>$0.80</td><td align=right>+12%</td></tr><tr><td>Operating cash flow per share</td><td align=right>$4.18</td><td align=right>$3.20</td><td align=right>+31%</td></tr><tr><td>Net production per share, Mcfe*</td><td align=right> 2.55</td><td align=right> 1.82</td><td align=right>+40%</td></tr><tr><td align=center colspan=4><font size=-1>*Mcfe: Converting oil and condensate to equivalent Mcf of gas at 1 barrel = 6 Mcf.</font></td></tr></table></center><br>In the E&P business, value is added by growing oil and gas production and cash flow, which is reinvested to grow reserves and, thereby, stockholders' equity. For this to occur profitably, there must also be, over time, growth in retained earnings.<br>During 1995, Newfield's annual production was 46.1 billion cubic feet of gas equivalent (Bcfe), up 41% from 1994. This generated $75.6 million of operating cash flow, up 31% from 1994. Capital expenditures for the year totaled $104 million and led to reserve additions during the year being 221% of production. Despite a difficult natural gas pricing environment for most of 1995, net income after all charges was $16.3 million, up 13% from 1995. Only in our start-up year of 1989 have we failed to grow the retained earnings of Newfield.<br><br>We drilled 16 exploratory wells, 10 of which were successful, and 4 of which were on production by year-end. Of the 10 discoveries, 4 were successful new fault block or deeper pool tests at South Timbalier 148, and 4 were discoveries on separate geologic features in the southern Vermilion area. These 10 exploratory successes, plus development drilling, primarily in the High Island A-537 field and the South Timbalier area, resulted in net reserve additions by the drillbit of 67.4 Bcfe.<br><br>Proved reserve acquisitions brought Newfield into 5 new producing fields, namely West Delta 152, East Cameron 64, East Cameron 151, South Timbalier 100, and Eugene Island 128. Additional interests were acquired at Ewing Bank 947, and in the South Timbalier 111 area. Reserve additions from 1995 acquisitions totaled 34.6 Bcfe,  bringing total reserve adds for the year to 102 Bcfe.<br><br>On the operating side, we continued to hold costs low. Lease operating expenses (LOE) averaged $0.31 per Mcfe versus $0.29/Mcfe in 1994. The properties we acquired during 1995 had higher LOE costs than our average, but our objective is to hold LOE at the $0.31/Mcfe level during 1996. General and administrative costs were $0.14/Mcfe in 1995 vs. $0.15/Mcfe in 1994.<br><br>Natural gas prices were dismal during most of 1995, averaging $1.67/Mcf at the wellhead as compared to $1.94/Mcf in 1994. Taking into account forward sales, our average gas price was $1.75/Mcf. Hedging added $2.7 million to our revenues and $1.8 million to our earnings during 1995, in addition to stabilizing our cash flow for reinvestment.<br><br>Oil and condensate prices were up during 1995, averaging $17.23/Bbl vs. $15.73/Bbl a year ago. On a Mcfe basis, our 1995 average price was $2.05/Mcfe vs. $2.14/Mcfe in 1994.<br><br>More detail about the projects and activities which underlie our strong 1995 performance is recounted elsewhere in this report. Let me now focus on what 1996 holds for Newfield.<br><br>First, our 1996 production target is about 15% greater than our 1995 volumes, as we place on production wells drilled during 1995, drill new wells to develop proven and probable reserves during 1996, and place them on production.<br><br>Second, we will be very active in exploiting our recent acquisitions. We currently have drilling rigs on platforms at Ewing Bank 947 and West Delta 152. We will drill new pool tests from each of these platforms plus numerous wells to test probable reserves. At East Cameron 64, we have a drilling campaign planned. Two wells are planned at Eugene Island 128. All four of these projects are expected to result in reserve additions as well as new productive capacity.<br><br>Third, we will be installing a platform at Vermilion 398, hooking up three wells drilled by the previous operator and drilling two additional wells. Production is expected to commence in the fourth quarter. No reserves have yet been booked for this project.<br><br>Fourth, we have 15 exploratory wells on our drill calendar in addition to the new pool tests mentioned above. Three of the higher potential ones are located near existing Newfield production platforms. One of these wildcats, Mississippi Canyon 357 #2, is designed to test the west flank of the salt dome from which West Delta 152 produces. It will be the first test drilled on this flank of the dome utilizing 3-D geophysics. The second higher potential test will be located on Ship Shoal 354, which is near our Ewing Bank 947 platform. This is a block we acquired in the May, 1995 lease sale. Since the sale, we have entered into a deal with Shell whereby they will earn a 35% interest in the block. We also expect to drill on South Timbalier 138, a block we acquired in the May, 1995 lease sale, which is north of our four new pool discoveries last year at South Timbalier 148. Our other exploratory wells will include a good diversification of risk and potential. Every 1996 wildcat will be evaluated with 3-D geophysics prior to drilling.<br><br>Finally, in addition to these opportunities which we know about as the year begins, we are well positioned to pursue additional opportunities during the year. We have the financial capability to complete attractive acquisitions, farmouts, or other trades, and are continuously searching for such opportunities.<br><br><table border=0 align=right><tr><td width=370 align=center><img src="6.jpg" align=center></td></tr><tr><td width=370 align=center><table border=1 cellpadding=4><tr><td align=center width=320><font size=-1><b>At Newfield, there are only two layers in the organization. <br>One is where the opportunities are generated and evaluated and operations are conducted.

The extremely cold November and its higher than normal gas demand, coupled with a hesitancy of users to make storage withdrawals so early in the heating season, led to much higher than expected prices in December, 1995, and January, 1996. Subsequent cold spells in December and January have resulted in very strong prices for the first quarter of 1996.<br><br>Newfield enters 1996 with 8.4 Bcf of its first quarter natural gas production hedged at an average wellhead price of $1.95 per Mcf. Additionally, 3.6 Bcf of both second and third quarter natural gas production is hedged at an average wellhead price of $1.78 per Mcf. Newfield has no basis risk against the Henry Hub in these transactions.<br><br>While we do not intend to make a practice of discussing price realizations on a monthly basis, I will tell you that in January, 1996, our average realization, net of our hedging activity was $2.19/Mcf. This clearly is not as attractive as the $3.50/Mcf index price we received in the cash markets, but it does represent a price which will yield very attractive returns on our investments in these producing properties, and it is a price 29% higher than we received in the first quarter of 1995.<br><br>The rising gas prices have been accompanied by a surge in deepwater drilling stimulated by, among other things, deepwater royalty relief. Activity on the shelf, i.e., 600' water depth and less, has increased also. This has resulted in a general tightening of supplies and services in the Gulf. Rig rates are higher. Derrick barges are tighter. Turnkey drillers are less competitive with our "do-it-yourself" case. Permits to drill take more leadtime to obtain, given the increased number of applications to the MMS, along with the two government shutdowns.<br><br>Planning and logistics and the ability to do things ourselves that we have heretofore often contracted for have become very important. Fortunately, many of us at Newfield have lived through similar times. Fortunately, also, we have been able to bring some highly competent people onto our payroll that we have worked with in the past to help deal with the more competitive services environment and with the more complex operations on our drill calendar.<br><br>I take some comfort in the fact that this is such a much more market-ruled industry than it was during the boom that ended ten years ago. The mechanisms are in place for markets and managements to be much more responsive to supply, demand, and price Ñ whether of hydrocarbons or services.<br><br>In the process of preparing some recent Congressional testimony, I developed some information about Newfield you might find of interest. We are the seventeenth largest operator of production in the Gulf. During 1995, we were the seventh most active driller. We managed a gross capital spending program of over $150 million and a gross expense budget of $30 million. Though we have only 63 employees on our payroll, about 800-1000 people were at work on Newfield projects each day during the year. We produce enough natural gas to supply one million households with their annual gas requirements. Our daily oil and condensate production, if converted to gasoline, would provide 14 gallon fillups for 50,000 automobiles every day. I concluded we add value for society in addition to adding value for shareholders. And I know if we don't do the latter, we won't long have the chance to do the former.<br><br>I feel very privileged to work with such a talented and motivated group of employees. Whatever the "value added" at Newfield, it is a result of their good ideas, hard work, cooperation, and remarkable persistence. I am grateful for that, and I am grateful to our stockholders for the resources and support which permit us to do what we do.<br><br><br>Sincerely,<br><br><b>Joe B.

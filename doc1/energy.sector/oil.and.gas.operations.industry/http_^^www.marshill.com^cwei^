CLAYTON WILLIAMS ENERGY, INC.<BR>ANNOUNCES 1997  THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
</B></CENTER>
<P>
Midland, Texas, October 28, 1997 -- Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ - NMS:CWEI) announced today net income for the third quarter of 1997 of $1.1 million, or $.12 per share, on revenues of $19.9 million, compared to net income of $3.5 million, or $.45 per share, on revenues of $15.6 million for the same period in 1996.  Discretionary cash flow (net income before exploration costs, depreciation, depletion and amortization and impairments) increased 43% to $13.7 million in 1997 from $9.6 million in 1996.
<P>
The decrease in net income was due primarily to higher exploration costs and DD&A expense, offset in part by higher oil and gas sales.  The Company, which utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting, expensed $3.9 million of exploration costs during the third quarter of 1997, substantially all of which was attributable to 3-D seismic surveys on exploratory projects.  The increase in DD&A expense resulted primarily from increased oil and gas production.
<P> 
Oil production was 57% higher during the current quarter as compared to the third quarter of 1996 due primarily to strong production performance from wells completed in the northern portion of the North Giddings Block.  The Company produced an average of 8,913 net barrels of oil per day during the third quarter of 1997, as compared to 5,663 net barrels of oil per day during the third quarter of 1996.
<P>
The Company completed its Cotton Valley 3-D seismic survey in Robertson County, Texas during the third quarter of 1997 and is currently processing this data.  The Company expects to begin interpreting the results of the survey during the fourth quarter of 1997, with any drilling commencing no sooner than the first quarter of 1998.
<P>
The Company previously reported two farm-in agreements covering approximately 50,000 acres through the Georgetown formation near its North Giddings Block.  Initial results from wells drilled on this acreage have been positive, and the Company plans to continue drilling in these areas.
<P>
The Company continues to evaluate the southern portion of its North Giddings Block. Initial drilling results in this area have not met expectations.  The results of the Company's initial infill drilling in the northern portion of its North Giddings Block have been successful, and it is anticipated additional locations will be added.  Drilling levels in the Giddings field area for 1998 will be determined based on results of drilling in the farm-in acreage, the infill drilling, and the results of the evaluation of the southern portion of the block.
<P>
The Company previously reported its increased exploration efforts in Mississippi, Louisiana and south Texas in areas where the Williams Companies have explored for oil and gas in the past.  In connection with its Mamou prospect, a deep Louisiana Wilcox test, the Company encountered structure and oil shows in two shallow formations, but discontinued drilling to the deeper horizons as the well ran low with depth. The Company is currently setting pipe and will be attempting to complete the well in the Sparta and Upper Wilcox formations.  Future tests of deeper formations in this project have not been ruled out.  3-D seismic studies have been completed on acreage in south Texas and in the oil producing salt domes of Mississippi.  The Company is currently evaluating the results of these surveys.

CLAYTON WILLIAMS ENERGY, INC.<BR>ANNOUNCES 1997  SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
</B></CENTER>
<P>
MIDLAND, TEXAS, July 23, 1997 -- Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ - NMS:CWEI) announced today net income for the second quarter of 1997 of $1.2 million, or $.13 per share, on revenues of $17.1 million, compared to net income of $2.4 million, or $.32 per share, on revenues of $16.1 million for the same period in 1996.  Discretionary cash flow (net income before exploration costs, depreciation, depletion and amortization and impairments) increased to $11.2 million in 1997 from $9.8 million in 1996.
<P>
The decrease in net income was due primarily to higher exploration costs, offset in part by higher oil and gas sales. The Company, which utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting, expensed $2.4 million of exploration costs during the second quarter of 1997.
<P>
Oil production was 18% higher during the current quarter as compared to the second quarter of 1996 due primarily to strong production performance from wells completed in the northern portion of the North Giddings Block.  The
Company produced an average of 7,747 net barrels of oil per day during the second quarter of 1997, as compared to 6,571 net barrels of oil per day during the second quarter of 1996. 
<P>
The Company's previously announced Cotton Valley 3-D seismic survey remains on schedule. Completion of the survey is anticipated in the third quarter of 1997. 
<P>
The Company previously reported two farm-in agreements covering approximately 50,000 acres through the Georgetown formation near its North Giddings Block.  Test wells have been drilled in both areas and are being evaluated. The Company plans continued drilling in these areas.
<P>
The Company is continuing to evaluate the southern portion of its North Giddings Block and plans to test the Buda and Georgetown formations in that area in August.  In response to reduced oil prices and this evaluation, the Company has reduced the number of active rigs in the Giddings area from three to two.  The Company has begun testing infill drilling on the northern portion of its North Giddings Block and believes that some additional locations will be added as a result.  Drilling activity levels in the Giddings field area for 1998 will be determined based on results of drilling in the farm-in acreage, the infill drilling and the results of the evaluation of the southern portion of the block.   
<P>
The Company has stepped up its exploration efforts in Mississippi, Louisiana and south Texas where the Williams Companies have explored for oil and gas in the past.  The Company is currently conducting 3-D seismic surveys in south Texas and in the oil producing salt domes in Mississippi.

CLAYTON WILLIAMS ENERGY, INC.<BR>ANNOUNCES 1997  FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
</B></CENTER>
<P>
Midland, Texas, April 30, 1997 -- Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ - NMS:CWEI) announced today net income for the first quarter of 1997 of $3.2 million, or $0.35 per share, on revenues of $17.9 million, compared to net income of $1.4 million, or $0.19 per share, on revenues of $13.3 million in 1996.  Cash flow from operating activities increased to $11.9 million in 1997 from $7.7 million in 1996.  
<P>
The principal factors contributing to the improvements over the first quarter of 1996 were higher oil and gas prices, increased oil production and lower interest expense attributable to decreased debt levels.  These benefits were offset in part by higher exploration costs associated with the Company's on-going Cotton Valley 3-D seismic survey, as well as costs for other exploration projects which the Company initiated in East and South Texas and Mississippi during the first quarter.
<P>
The Company is actively conducting a 3-D seismic survey covering approximately 50,000 net  acres in Robertson County, Texas in connection with its previously announced Cotton Valley Exploratory Project.  The seismic survey is currently on schedule for completion during the third
quarter of 1997 at a net cost of approximately $4 million.  Any drilling resulting from the survey is expected to begin during the latter part of the fourth quarter of 1997.  
<P>
In addition to the Cotton Valley Exploratory Project expenditures, the Company plans to spend $42 million in 1997 in its horizontal drilling program and $8 million for other exploration projects located in east and south Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.  The Company plans to have two rigs
drilling in its North Giddings Block.  As previously reported, the Company is continuing to evaluate results from drilling in the southern portion of this block.  The Company plans to utilize a third rig drilling on its farm-in acreage in Robertson County, Texas.  The first well has been spudded and is currently drilling in the Georgetown formation.  
<P>
Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. is an independent energy company located in Midland, Texas.

CLAYTON WILLIAMS ENERGY, INC.<BR>ANNOUNCES 1996 RESULTS AND 1997 DRILLING PLANS
</B></CENTER>
<P>
Midland, Texas, March 18, 1997 -- Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ - NMS:CWEI) reported today net income for 1996 of $13.7 million, or $1.77 per share, on revenues of $64.9 million, compared to a net loss of $8.1 million, or $1.31 per share, on revenues of $49.3 million for 1995.  Cash flow from operating activities increased to $40.3 million in 1996 from $24.2 million in 1995.
<P>
For the quarter ended December 31, 1996, the Company reported net income of $6.4 million, or $0.77 per share, on revenues of $19.8 million, compared to a net loss of $10.8 million, or $1.46 per share, on revenues of $11.6 million for 1995.
<P>
The Company also reported proved oil and gas reserves at December 31, 1996 of 8.5 million barrels of oil and 35.8 Bcf of natural gas, as estimated by independent engineers.  Discounted future net revenues at December 31, 1996, computed in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines, were $160.7 million.
<P>
During 1997, the Company will continue the development of its 117,000 net acres in the North Giddings Block in East Central Texas by drilling up to 36 wells.  The Company continues to evaluate drilling results in the southern portion of its North Giddings Block, and is modifying its

The Company has been able to expand the acreage covered by its Cotton Valley 3-D seismic survey from approximately 20,000 to 50,000 net acres while increasing the estimated cost of the survey only $900,000 from $3.1 million to approximately $4.0 million.  The Company will continue to evaluate opportunities to expand the area covered by the survey, which could increase the cost of the survey.  Due to the additional acreage
included in the survey, the Company anticipates completion during the third quarter of 1997, with any drilling resulting from the survey beginning in the fourth quarter of 1997.

<IMG SRC=Cwwj2.gif BORDER=0>
<P>
Dear Shareholders,
<P>
The results of our operations for 1996 are now complete and I am pleased to report to you that Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. enjoyed its most
successful year since its formation in 1993.  Cash flow from operating activities increased to $40.3 million in 1996, up from $24.2 million in
1995. During 1996 we added approximately 5,000 MBOE of estimated proved reserves through drilling and acquisitions. These reserve additions replaced 159% of 1996 production.
<P>
Historically, we have focused our exploration and drilling activities in the Cretaceous Trend formations in South Texas. In an effort to expand our
Cretaceous Trend drilling opportunities in 1997, we have entered into two farm-in agreements covering up to approximately 50,000 net acres, primarily in Robertson County, Texas.  We anticipate commencing drilling activities in this area by May, 1997. 
<P>
During 1997, we will continue the development of our 117,000 net acres in the North Giddings Block in East Central Texas by drilling up to 36 wells. We continue to evaluate drilling results in the southern portion of the North Giddings Block and are modifying our completion technique with respect to wells drilling in this area.
<P>
During 1996, we were able to expand the acreage covered by the Cotton Valley 3-D seismic survey from 20,000 net acres to approximately 50,000 net acres.  This was accomplished while increasing the estimated cost of the survey by only $900,000, from $3.1 million to approximately $4.0 million. Due to the additional acreage included in the survey, we expect completion during the third quarter of 1997, with any drilling resulting from the survey beginning in the fourth quarter of 1997.
<P>
The Company anticipates expanding its 1997 exploration outside the Cretaceous Trend to include newly acquired areas in South and East Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.  The majority of these are areas where I have successfully explored for oil and gas in the past.  The Company anticipates spending approximately $8 million on these projects, a substantial portion of which will be for seismic and leasing activities.
<P>
I believe that our efforts contributed to a stronger company in 1996. Stronger oil prices and continued hard work carry the promise of a bright
future for the Company.

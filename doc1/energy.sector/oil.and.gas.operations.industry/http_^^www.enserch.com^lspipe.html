<p><H2>Lone Star Pipeline</H2>
<P>Lone Star Pipeline Company was formed in May 1995, as a result of the seperation of the transmission and distribution entities of ENSERCH Corporation.  The pipeline transmission, gathering, processing and marketing entities of this company were formerly operated under the name Lone Star Gas Company.
<p>Lone Star Pipeline Company has 9,200 miles of gathering and transmission pipeline in Texas and is ranked as the 14th largest system in the United States.  The system connects with three major hubs -- Waha in West Texas, Carthage in East Texas and Katy in Southeast Texas, near Houston.  A total of 80 interconnects with 34 different pipelines, as well as 20,000 wells, connect either directly or through processing plants to the system.  In addition, seven active gas storage facilities with total working gas capacity of 47 billion cubic feet and peak deliverability of about 1.3 billion cubic feet of gas per day, are operated by Lone Star Pipeline Co.

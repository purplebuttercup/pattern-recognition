<p>The company has evaluated numerous areas of the Gulf Coast Region from the Mississippi River southeast to the Florida Panhandle.  The company initially entered this area by evaluating the onshore shallow Frio/Miocene Trend.  The company’s emphasis is shifting to larger exploration targets in this area due to the greater possible return on investment resulting from the size of the geological features which remain to be explored and produced.  This includes shallow offshore prospects such as the company’s Smith Point activities and deeper and potentially much larger prospects centering in the transitional waters of South Louisiana.

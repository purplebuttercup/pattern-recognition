Foreland has always sought out the most qualified individuals available as the company has grown and new positions have been needed.  We would like to introduce you to the people of Foreland.  These individuals have dedicated themselves to the company and the goal of discovering large reserves of oil in Nevada.  With their enthusiasm and commitment, these people are Foreland's most important asset.

Dr. Grant Steele, Foreland's Founder and Chairman was employed by Gulf Oil Corporation for 30 years.  From 1973 to 1980, Grant was Chief Geologist - U.S. for Gulf Oil.  During that tenure, he reviewed some 200 to 400 prospects per year, to recommend where Gulf should spend its exploration dollars.  While at Gulf, Grant also supervised a Resource Evaluation group which spent six years assessing the remaining undiscovered petroleum reserves in the United States.  The results of the Resource Evaluation study pointed to North-Central Nevada as one of the few remaining areas which could contain reserves of 100 million to over one billion barrels of oil.  Gulf Oil, acting upon this study, set up a special group under Grant to further evaluate the North-Central Nevada area.  It is this data base upon which Gulf spent $6 million and 27 man-years and which in 1985 became the foundation of Foreland's exploration effort.
<P>
Grant continues to be active in Foreland's Nevada project, providing geological insight to the stratigraphic complexities often encountered during drilling.  Grant was the well site geologist at the Company's Ghost Ranch discovery.

Mr. Kenneth L. Ransom, who has been Vice President of Exploration since the company's founding, manages most of the day to day exploration and drilling activities for the company.  He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Geological Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines (1979) and his Master's degree in Geological Sciences from Brown University (1981).
<P>
Ken first worked on the Nevada study while he was with Gulf Oil.  As Senior Geologist under Dr. Grant Steele, he initially focused on the stratigraphy of the reservoir section in the lower Paleozoic.  Later in the project, he was responsible for the accumulation, integration, and interpretation of the entire Gulf data base.
<P>
Ken now directs Foreland's geological and geophysical exploration effort in Nevada.  He ensures that Foreland's data acquisition and interpretation is designed to focus on thorough evaluation of specific prospect areas.  Ken has been an active participant in several Nevada Petroleum Society Field Trips.  He has published numerous papers on Nevada exploration and geology, and continues to be solicited for additional publications

Mr. Bruce Decker, Foreland's Vice President of Operations and a founder of Foreland's subsidiary, Krutex Energy, holds a degree in finance and management from the University of Utah, and has over 18 years experience in the oil industry.  In 1979, he became General Partner of Great Western Oil Co., who successfully drilled a number of oil wells in Texas.  In 1983, he was instrumental in forming Krutex Energy.  Krutex participated with Foreland in drilling four exploratory and development wells in Nevada prior to the Krutex merger with Foreland in 1989.
<P>
Bruce manages Foreland's field operations including the negotiation of drilling contracts, surface equipment installation, drill site preparation, filing of state and BLM permits and insuring regulatory compliance in all field operations.  In 1996, Foreland received the Bureau of Land Management's national "Health of the Land Award" for Bruce's reclamation program at the Eagle Springs Field.

Mr. David T. Greene, who joined the Company in 1995, is a petroleum engineer with 17 years oil and gas experience.  He holds a bachelor’s degree in earth science from the University of California at Santa Cruz and a masters degree in petroleum engineering from Stanford University.  Mr. Greene has worked at Amoco Production Co. as Staff Petroleum Engineer, for Pacific Enterprises Oil Co. as Division Engineering Manager, and for Plains Petroleum Operating Co. as Senior Exploitation Engineer.  Mr. Greene has experience in the Rocky Mountain, Mid-Continent, Gulf Coast, and Offshore Gulf of Mexico areas, especially in evaluation, design, and implementation of secondary and tertiary recovery projects, especially relating to heavy oil and tight reservoirs.  Mr. Greene is responsible for providing engineering and field supervision support of the Company’s Eagle Springs Field drilling and development program and for overall Nevada exploitation.

Mr. Jerry Hansen, who joined Foreland in 1986, has 12 years of oil and gas experience directed toward prospect generation and evaluation in the Powder River Basin, Gulf Coast and, primarily, in Nevada. He graduated with degrees in geology from the University of Colorado (1973) and the University of Arizona (1982).
<P>
As Senior Structural Geologist for Foreland, Jerry's primary responsibility is in the generation and development of drillable prospects from inception to actual wellsite operations.  To this end, he has gained years of field and outcrop experience in Nevada, including geologic mapping and analysis of structures, measuring of section, and sampling for petroleum source rocks, reservoir rocks and paleontogical information.  Together with Ken Ransom, he has published several papers on the geologic structure, stratigraphy and oil fields of North-Central Nevada.

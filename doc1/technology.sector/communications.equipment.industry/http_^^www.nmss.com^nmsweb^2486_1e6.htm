Natural Platforms products from Natural MicroSystems, with their state-of-the-art designs and <A HREF="/intlstat/apprcoun.htm">Global Approvals</A> in over 30 countries, deliver maximum performance, the highest capacity in the industry, and unparalleled flexibility for the development of Open Telecommunications solutions. Within the <U>Telephony Services Architecture</U> (TSA), Natural Platforms offers a large number of choices for voice with network interfaces, voice only, and network interface only products all built on the open, industry-standard MVIP architecture enabling access to technology from multiple vendors for true interoperability.<BR>

<P><B>The Alliance Generation Family</B><BR>
The <A HREF="2492_1e6.htm">Alliance Generation</A> family provides a range of scalable products for application providers and infrastructure providers.  Platforms that offer both voice processing and network interfaces are the AG-T1, AG-E1, and the AG-8/80.   The <A HREF="22b6_1c6.htm">AG-T1</A>and <A HREF="2336_1c6.htm">AG-E1</A> platforms contain 24 and 30 ports of voice processing respectively, an integrated digital trunk interface and ISDN PRI capability.  The <A HREF="215e_1c6.htm">AG-8/80</A>, with 80 MIPS of DSP power on-board,  provides 8 ports of voice processing along with analog telephone connections for loopstart or DID interfaces.<BR>

<P>For building high-capacity solutions, the AG resource platforms deliver 24 to 60 ports in a single slot.  They are designed for use with separate network interface cards such as the NMS World Trunk Interface (<A HREF="22f6_1c6.htm">WTI-8</A>) card, the AG Connect family of products for analog trunk and station interfaces, or other MVIP compliant cards.  The <A HREF="253a_1c6.htm">AG-24</A> provides 24 ports of voice and call processing and is upgradeable to 48 ports.  The <A HREF="22ca_1c6.htm">AG-30</A> provides 30 ports of voice and call processing and is upgradeable to 60 ports.  The <A HREF="235a_1c6.htm">AG-48</A> and <A HREF="245e_1c6.htm">AG-60</A>  provide 48 and 60 ports of voice and call processing while preserving a single PC slot solution.  The<A HREF="215e_1c6.htm"> AG-8/80</A> is also available in a DSP resource version. <BR>

<P><B>AGRealtime - Wireless and IP Telephony Solutions         </B>    <BR>
	Developers who are building wireless solutions can take advantage of the AG Realtime family of products - the  <A HREF="246e_1c6.htm">AG Realtime/320</A> and new AG Realtime/2.  The AG Realtime/320 is a unique DSP resource daughter card for the Alliance Generation (AG) product line which implements through software 32 GSM vocoders. For In-building Wireless, wireless PBX, Wireless Local Loop, and PCS/cellular applications, the <A HREF="/nmsweb/3966_1c6.htm">IS-641 (ACELP) vocoder and Transcoder and Rate Adapter Unit (TRAU)</A> software executes as a downloadable module on the Alliance Generation&reg; Realtime/2 (AG-RT/2) hardware platform. <BR>
	<BR>
	For building IP Telephony Gateway solutions, the AG Realtime/320 is part of the <A HREF="/nmsweb/2f86_1c6.htm">FusionTM</A> development platform along with the Alliance Generation T1 and the TX2000 IP Router.  Fusion is a scalable, programmable platform which supports PSTN network interfaces, data network integration, voice encoding and decoding, fax modems, and data modulation/demodulation.  Fusion supports TCI/IP, PPP, UDP and evolving H.323 protocols.  <BR>

<P>	Designed to execute on the Alliance Generation&reg; (AG) Realtime family of digital signal processing engines, the Natural MicroSystems <A HREF="/nmsweb/396a_1c6.htm">G.723.1 TRAU</A> (Transcoder and Rate Adapter Unit), is a full-duplex implementation of the ITU G.723.1 dual-rate vocoder with integrated echo cancellation and the Natural MicroSystems <A HREF="/nmsweb/396e_1c6.htm">MS GSM Transcoder and Rate Adapter Unit (TRAU)</A> which is a full-duplex implementation of Microsoft’s GSM 6.10 vocoder with integrated echo cancellation. <A HREF="/nmsweb/3962_1c6.htm">Voxware's MetaVoice RT 24</A>algorithm is a 2.4 kbps, realtime voice encoding algorithm designed specifically for applications requiring minimal processing power and high-quality speech. <BR>

<P><B>The AG Connect Family</B><BR>
NMS’s network interface products, called the AG Connect family, provide connections to public and private telephone networks. The AG Connect family provides high-density analog  trunk and station interfaces which may be combined with AG family boards.  The World Trunk Interface-8 (WTI-8) is a single-slot, eight port digital interface designed for applications outside the U.S.  The <A HREF="22f6_1c6.htm">WTI-8</A> may be combined with AG family boards such as the AG-8 or the AG-24 and has been approved in over 15 countries.  Other members of the AG Connect family include the <A HREF="22fe_1c6.htm">T Connect</A> board for analog trunk interfaces and the <A HREF="2466_1c6.htm">S Connect</A> for station interfaces, both available in configurations of 8, 16 and 24 interfaces.  The S/T Connect board combines 8 station interfaces and 16 loopstart interfaces.  In addition, the <A HREF="24a2_1c6.htm">ASI, Analog Station Interface</A> board and the <A HREF="216a_1c6.htm">ATI, Analog Trunk Interface</A> board are available for use with both the AG and the VBX family.<BR>

<P>The <A HREF="245a_1c6.htm">AG Conference</A>  Board is a cost-effective MVIP conferencing solution for up to 128 parties with up to 42 conferences.  To extend the TSA architecture beyond a single PC, the  <A HREF="24de_1c6.htm">MC1</A>, Multi-Chassis MVIP Interface Card enables the creation of distributed solutions ranging from 24 to thousands of ports.<BR>

<P><B>NMS Europe (VOX) Products</B><BR>
Natural MicroSystems acquired VOX S.A. in 1995. A profitable, growing company of over 50 people, VOX  specialized in high-value, low port count voice, fax and switching platforms.  With a design that is complementary to and interoperable with Natural MicroSystems’ Alliance Generation architecture, the VOX product family satisfies the demands of developers building sophisticated systems for workgroups, branch offices, and small businesses.  Today, VOX has been fully merged with NMS and is referred to as NMS Europe.<BR>

<P>NMS Europe adds to our expertise in hardware and software interfaces that meet the varying requirements of public and private telephone networks throughout the world. Additionally, they have become the NMS sales, marketing, service, and development organization for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The VOX product line is being integrated into the NMS product line through the development of a 2-8 port, low cost, high value product, code named Quattro. The existing product line is still fully supported.<BR>

<P><B>Intelligent Network and Data Communications Products</B><BR>
Acquired in 1996, the Intelligent Network and Data Communications Divison of Natural MicroSystems (formerly TEKnique, Inc.) develops and distributes software and hardware products for markets indicated in it's name. The INDC's product lines include Signaling System 7 (SS7) technology, an international standard for network management, and widely deployed data communications technologies including X.25 and TCP/IP routing.<BR>

Powerwave Technologies, Inc. designs and manufactures both single carrier 
and multi-carrier ultra-linear power amplifiers which are sold into the 
<strong><A HREF="pcell.htm">Cellular</A>, <A HREF="pcell.htm">PCS</A></strong> and <strong>SMR</strong> markets. 
The Company's single carrier amplifier products are primarily for <strong>PCS</strong>
networks while its multi-carrier amplifier products include both the <B>MCA</B> cellular
product series and the <strong>PCS</strong> multi-carrier product series. 
Powerwave also designs and manufactures single carrier 
power amplifiers which are sold into the <B>SMR</B> and <B>Paging</B> 
markets. The products sold into these markets include the <B>RF</B>, 
<B>LP</B>,and <B>LDA</B> product series. 
<P>
Powerwave's ultra-linear multi-carrier amplifiers utilize a single feed 
forward loop, which allows greater operating efficiency and requires 
approximately 25% less electrical current than competing multi-loop 
designs. The Company's amplifiers employ a microprocessor based 
feed-forward loop design which results in better tracking between the 
pilot tone and the actual signal and reduces interference. Powerwave's 
multi-carrier design also utilizes an actively switched output combiner, 
which allows any number of amplifiers to be &quot;hot-swapped&quot; 
without a significant loss of power. This design allows for true cold 
standby switching of a standby amplifier, thereby providing network 
operators with a backup redundancy solution for even greater reliability.

<td><B>MCA SERIES</B><br>The MCA Series 
offers ultra-linear multi-carrier power amplifier technology for CDMA and 
TDMA digital cellular systems positioned between 800-960 MHz, as well as 
analog systems utilizing AMPS, TACS, ETACS and GSM protocols. The 
amplifiers are designed to be installed in racks of three or four 
amplifiers. Smart combiner paralleling units allow both higher power as 
well as system redundancy, which is the ability of the system to remain 
in operation in the event of the failure of one or more of the paralleled 
amplifiers. When combined, the units have &quot;hot swap&quot; capabilities 
whereby one unit can be removed from the rack while all others remain in 
operation. All MCA series multi-carrier amplifiers provide remote 
status/fault monitoring capabilities. 
<P>
The MCA8000-250, which the Company believes is the leading amplifier in 
South Korea's nationwide digital cellular system, produces 25 Watts (W) 
average, 250W peak power with maximum distortion of -60dBc. Up to 4 
units can be combined in parallel utilizing the Company's fully redundant 
smart combiner racks for effective average power ratings of 20W, 45W, 70W, 
and 90W. </P>
<P>
The MCA9100-40 which produces 40W average, 400W peak power 
per channel with maximum distortion of -65dBc, while retaining its 
hot swap, paralleling, and redundancy capabilities. Generally, 
as compared to the MCA 8000-250, one less amplifier can be used to 
achieve a similar power rating, thus decreasing the effective cost per 
watt to the service operator. Combining up to 4 units in a rack yields 
effective power ratings of 32W, 70W, 100W and 135W. </P>
<P>
Powerwave has recently started shipping a new 50 watt MCA Series amplifier
for cellular networks and the Company also offers within the MCA Series other 
standard linear products 
including 40W Class A and 250W Class AB amplifiers which are used in 
applications requiring reduced linearity or power.</P>

<td><B>PCS SERIES</B><br> The PCS 
Series offers both single and multi-carrier amplifiers for use in 
PCS networks that operate in the international DCS-1800 frequency of 
1.8 gigahertz (GHz) and the new United States PCS band at 1.9GHz. Typical 
system applications include CDMA, TDMA, and GSM protocols with output 
power ranging from 5W to 100W. The PCS Series of multi-carrier amplifiers 
offer similar power combining, system redundancy, and remote 
status/fault monitoring capabilities as the Company's MCA Series with 
output power ranging from 10W to 100W and distortion of -60dBc. <br><br>

<td><B>RF SERIES</B><br> The RF Series 
is the Company's standard single-carrier analog amplification product for 
SMR, paging, repeater and trunking applications. These amplifiers operate 
in discreet bands within the 30 MHz to 960MHz frequency range with input 
powers ranging from 10mW to 30W and produce output powers ranging from 
30W to 160W. These amplifiers have been designed for simple installation 
and maintenance and are fully modular for quick and easy field service.</P>

is a single-carrier analog amplifier similar to the Company's RF Series 
amplifiers, but in a smaller 5&quot; format. The LP Series is used in 
SMR, paging, repeater and trunking applications. These amplifiers also 
operate in the 35 MHz to 960 MHz frequency range with input powers ranging 
from 200mW to 20W and produce output power ranging from 30W to 60W. </P>

<td><B>LDA SERIES</B><br> The LDA 
Series provides broadband digital or analog amplification as a 
&quot;building block&quot; in larger amplification systems or as a 
stand-alone amplifier. The LDA Series products are used as a building 
block for applications involving electronic countermeasures 
(&quot;ECM&quot;) and radar systems. The products are also used as stand 
alone amplifiers for applications in laboratory testing, medical research 
and multi-band transceivers and are designed to operate in wide frequency 
ranges between 20MHz to1GHz with output powers ranging from 5W to 150W. </P>

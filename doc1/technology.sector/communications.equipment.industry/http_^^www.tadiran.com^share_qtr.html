Dear Shareholder,<br>
<br>
I am particularly pleased to send you this third quarter 
report. It contains not only Tadiran’s hard earned, record 
breaking past performance, but also tells of exciting new 
developments leading to future growth. You will read of 
recently acquired orders that are propelling us into the 
fourth quarter with a one billion dollar backlog.  And as 
you peruse the following figures - results that I know 
will please you as much as they do me - I ask that you 
also read between the lines. For what is contained in this 
third quarter report, though not described here, is 
Tadiran’s indefatigable spirit, the genius of our research 
and development team, the stamina and persistence of 
our sales and marketing corps, and the vision and 
leadership of our executive and management team.<br><br>
This winning combination has resulted in gross margins 
of 30.7% and significant profitability by each and every 
Tadiran segment.<br>
Gross margins of <br>
30.7% and significant<br> 
profitability by each and<br> 
every Tadiran segment. <br>
Operating income for the quarter increased by 54.3% to 
$24.0 million as compared to $15.6 million last year. 
Net income for the quarter increased by 75.1% to $20.2 
million, or $1.03 per share, as compared to $11.5 
million, or $0.59 per share, for the third quarter of 1996. 
Sales for the third quarter of 1997 were $278.9 million, 
an increase of 4.2% as compared to $267.5 million for 
the same quarter of 1996. <br><br>
Gross profit for the quarter increased by 23.4% to $85.6 
million, (resulting in the gross margin of 30.7%), 
compared to $69.4 million for the third quarter last year.<br><br>
As I mentioned, all operating segments were profitable. 
Most notable was the Communications segment, whose 
export sales in the third quarter increased significantly 
contributing to an increase in its sales of 32% and a 
whopping 129% increase in operating income.<br><br>
Export sales for the quarter increased by 26.0% to 
$154.4 million. Commercial export sales increased by 
34.7% to $87.4 million, due principally to sales of 
internally developed commercial telecommunications 
products. <br><br>
For the nine months, total export sales increased by 
26.8% to $483.5 million. Exports now make up 56.5% 
of total sales and demonstrates a most desirable shift 
away from domestic dependency. Commercial export 
sales increased by 40.4% to $271.8 million, up from 
$193.6 million in the first nine months of 1996.<br><br>
These results reflect revenue growth and strong 
operating income increases in both the Communications 
and Electronic Systems segments. <br><br>
The true measure of these achievements are only fully  
appreciated when seen in light of the substantial decline 
of approximately 50% in domestic sales to Bezeq. 
Increased export sales, one of our primary goals, has 
significantly offset this prior domestic dependence and is 
leading us to an even stronger, more profitable future 
with ever expanding international markets.<br><br>
For example, during this quarter the Communications 
segment received a number of sizable orders in the area 
of military communications: a multi-year, $64 million 
order from the Navy and Marines of two Latin American 
countries for advanced HF and VHF communications 
equipment; a similar order, worth $17 million, from 
Thailand's armed forces; and an order for portable 
computers from the U.S. Marines which  could reach 
$52 million in the coming years.<br><br>
After the end of this quarter, we announced a joint 
venture with American entrepreneurs to develop a 
system for physically locating a cellular phone user who 
dials the emergency service number (911). This new 
product is being developed in response to new U.S. 
federal regulations requiring all mobile phone operators 
to provide such a service by the year 2001. <br><br>
And this week we finalized a contract for Command and 
Control Systems with the Swiss Army Artillery Division 
worth $119 million. <br><br>
These new and exhilarating orders point the way to 
Tadiran’s future and are milestones along our path to 
success. This path leads to expanded export markets 
eager to receive our cutting-edge technology - technology 
so advanced that it not only meets current need, but 
predicts and stimulates future demand. Tadiran’s R&D 
component is creating product which  our marketing and 
sales team carries to the international market place with 
enthusiasm, confidence and pride. Our feet are now well 
planted on the road to ever greater success and we thank 
you, dear shareholder, for joining us on this most 
profitable journey.<br><br>

Sincerely,<br><br>

        </font><p><font size="3" face="Arial">The telephone
        industry is wrestling with the challenge of increasing
        the volume of information that flows between subscribers
        connected to the public switched telephone network.
        Technology is becoming available to significantly boost
        the rate of information transmission. However, a number
        of obstacles still stand in the way of delivering
        universal high data rate services. Obstacles include
        agreements on interoperability standards for new
        services, the high cost of new services until volume
        deployment enables cost reductions, and the need to
        utilize legacy network infrastructures that telephone
        companies cannot afford to replace.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Several solutions have
        been proposed to enable telephone companies to support
        bandwidth intensive applications. Options include
        &#147;xDSL,&#148; which will work to some degree over
        existing copper facilities; SONET network architecture;
        and the development of a separate ATM data switching
        network. To date there is little agreement on how to
        standardize any of these solutions to ensure
        interoperability between carriers. This uncertainty
        raises the financial risks telephone companies face when
        selecting equipment for high bandwidth applications
        &#151; will today&#146;s equipment be obsolete when
        tomorrow&#146;s technology arrives?</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">AFC has developed a
        solution to help telephone companies reduce the economic
        risks of selecting access equipment in today&#146;s
        rapidly changing environment. AFC&#146;s strategy is to
        provide a platform that will deliver currently available
        technologies and smoothly adapt to any future network
        requirements.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The main building block
        for this strategy is an enhanced Channel Bank Assembly
        (CBA) backplane for the UMC 1000. The new backplane
        supports 6.2 Gbps bandwidth, an increase of over 60 times
        the UMC&#146;s 100 Mbps backplane. The backplane is
        designed for ATM cell connectivity, TDM time slot
        connectivity and a OC-x SONET connectivity. This
        &#147;broadband-ready&#148; CBA supports a family of
        plug-in modules that are being developed to
        cost-effectively support xDSL services and SONET and ATM
        network interfaces.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">With the broadband-ready
        CBA, AFC customers will have a cost-effective solution
        for today&#146;s subscriber demands with the security of
        knowing they can also handle tomorrow&#146;s network
        requirements.</font></p>

        technology leadership in local loop access. As the pace
        of technological change accelerates, service providers
        need equipment that will support new standards in order
        to bring services to market quickly and cost-effectively.
        We&#146;re continually enhancing the UMC 1000 product
        family to ensure that it gives you all the options you
        need to serve the evolving needs of your subscribers.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">AFC recently started
        shipping a groundbreaking &#147;broadband-ready&#148; UMC
        1000 Channel Bank Assembly (CBA). The UMC 1000 backplane
        now supports 6.2 Gbps, some 60 times its previous
        bandwidth, and is capable of delivering narrow band and
        broadband services anywhere in the network.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The
        &#147;supercharged&#148; UMC 1000 backplane will be able
        to support TDM, cell (ATM and Frame Relay) and SONET
        (OC-x) network connectivity&#150;in addition to all of
        the narrow band transport and services that it has always
        supported. The addition of broadband support makes the
        UMC 1000 virtually future-proof, allowing you to deliver
        today&#146;s and tomorrow&#146;s services from the same
        network platform.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">With broadband and narrow
        band support from the same terminal, the UMC 1000 is
        setting a new standard for local loop access equipment.
        That&#146;s why we&#146;re calling the UMC 1000 the
        world&#146;s rst &#147;3rd Generation Digital Loop
        Carrier (3GDLC).&#148; It goes far beyond DLC and NGDLC
        capabilities, adding enough bandwidth to unclog the local
        loop bottleneck that exists in many applications while
        maintaining an attractive cost pro le for any line size.</font></p>

        face="Arial">The Alaskan towns of Allakalet and Alatna
        are two miles apart but are separated by the Koyokuk
        River and the Arctic Circle. Prior to 1995, no telephone
        facilities existed on the Alatna side of the river. When
        they needed to make a phone call, residents of Alatna
        were forced to travel by canoe across the river.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">&#147;To be without
        telephone service in these remote areas is particularly
        difficult,&#148; says Tom Ervin of Alaska Power and
        Telephone Company. &#147;Phones are the only way for
        people to connect to many of the services they
        need.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">In 1995, flooding damaged
        both towns, destroying the Allakalet central office. At
        that point, neither town had phone service.<img
        src="../images/alaska.gif" align="right" border="2"
        hspace="0" vspace="3" width="288" height="294"></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">&#147;As we were
        rebuilding the Allakalet power system, the leaders of
        Alatna approached us about bringing telephone service to
        their community,&#148; says Ervin. We had no problem with
        Allakalet, but getting service across the river to Alatna
        would be expensive.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">&#147;We serve a lot of
        customers in our region with UMC 1000 equipment,&#148;
        says Ervin. &#147;We looked at our options, and saw a way
        to use the UMC 1000 to serve parts of Allakalet and to
        reach Alatna.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial"><strong>How
        did they do it?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">&#147;From
        a UMC 1000 in our Allakalet Central office, we connected
        a UMC 1000 T1 transceiver to a microwave radio antenna.
        Then we installed a UMC 48 line cabinet in Alatna, and
        hooked up another T1 out of that terminal to a radio
        antenna to create a T1 span between terminals. Now we can
        deliver phone service to Alatna from the Allakalet
        exchange.&#148;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial"><strong>How
        has the system performed?</strong> </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">&#147;Flawlessly,&#148;
        according to Ervin. &#147;The residents of Alatna are
        thrilled. Its a major contribution to the quality of life
        in their community. And the solution was extremely
        cost-effective. Original estimates for bringing service
        to Alatna were $250,000. The UMC 1000 solution cost about
        $70,000.&#148;</font></p>

        UMC 1000 Channel Bank Assembly (CBA).</font></p>
        <p><font color="#24289A" face="Arial">The addition of
        broadband support makes the UMC 1000 a truly
        &#147;future-proof&#148; platform. Let me tell you how it
        works.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#24289A" face="Arial">The flexibility of
        the UMC 1000 is derived from its backplane. We&#146;ve
        improved the UMC backplane to support 6.2 Gbps of
        bandwidth. Every card slot in the UMC CBA has access to
        this backplane, and bandwidth is allocated to the cards
        dynamically so that each card can seize all available
        bandwidth when active. Bandwidth is freed-up when the
        transceiver or service module is not in use.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#24289A" face="Arial">The UMC 1000
        broadband backplane features a 5.3 Gbps SONET bus, an 800
        Mbps cell (ATM/Frame Relay) bus, and a 100 Mbps TDM bus.
        Both narrow band and broadband transport and service
        modules will plug into any CBA general purpose slots and
        will access the appropriate bus. Narrow band transport
        and service modules will access the TDM bus, ATM modules
        will access the cell bus, etc, enabling the UMC to
        deliver broadband and narrow band services anywhere in
        the network. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#24289A" face="Arial">Broadband service
        and transport modules for the UMC 1000 are currently in
        development. In the future, you&#146;ll see cards that
        offer xDSL service, ATM and SONET network connectivity,
        and more.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#24289A" face="Arial">We&#146;re excited
        about the new UMC 1000 backplane because it realizes our
        vision for the UMC 1000 as a flexible, cost-effective
        access system that is unrestricted by technological
        change and that allows telephone companies to
        economically deliver service to any subscriber area.</font></p>

        So what&#146;s the difference between the T1-XCVR and the
        T1X-XCVR? <br>
        Power. More specifically, the T1-XCVR is a line powering
        transceiver which regulates 60 mA at 130V. The unit is
        designed to drive multiple repeaters in a long copper
        route at a maximum distance of 36dB, or can be used to
        terminate a span line. Of course, some T1 spans do not
        require repeaters and may run only a short distance (655
        feet or less). That's where the T1X is used. The T1X-XCVR
        is a non-line powering transceiver designed for
        applications where power and sealing current are not
        necessary. Examples of such applications would be short

        <p><font color="#24289A" face="Arial"><strong>T1A and
        T1AX</strong><br>
        The T1A and T1AX are channel units that transmit (and
        receive) a T1 signal asynchronously. The T1A performs
        line powering, similar to the T1-XCVR. The T1AX is
        non-powering and drives DSX level signals up to 655 feet.
        T1A and T1AX channel units provide an intact T1 rate
        interface, transmitting and receiving 1.544 Mbps. They
        transmit T1 signals transparently as a data stream that
        is passed intact to its destination. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#24289A" face="Arial"><strong>What are
        synchronous and asynchronous transmission?</strong><br>
        Synchronous transmission means that a signal is divided
        into channels, which are identified by clocking signals
        included in the transmission. In the case of the T1
        transceivers, the 1.544 Mbps T1 signal is divided into 24
        channels, or timeslots, using some of the bandwidth for
        clock signals. Asynchronous transmission uses no clocking
        signal. T1A and T1AX channel units deliver the full 1.544
        Mbps, typically for data applications</font></p>

        program is simple to load and operate, and can be used to
        configure anything from point-to-point systems to 16 node
        networks. When you start the Autoconfigurator, it will
        prompt you with a few simple questions. You only need to:

        circuits can be groomed directly from a UMC 1000 Local
        Exchange Terminal in the Central Office to the HRU using
        the UMC T1 Transceiver (T1HD-XCVR) at the LET,
        eliminating the need for additional Central Office
        equipment which would otherwise be required.</font></p>

<STRONG>Company Background</STRONG>
<P>
Powerwave Technologies began in California in 1985
selling RF power amplifiers for use in analog wireless networks
under the name of Milcom International, Inc. In 1993, the Company
began selling amplifiers to the Air-to-Ground market, where amplifiers
are used in both ground stations and in commercial aircraft to
amplify telephone transmissions between airline passengers and
ground based networks. In 1995, the Company began selling multi-carrier
ultra-linear RF power amplifiers for installation in the digital
cellular network being built in South Korea. The Company changed
its name to Powerwave Technologies, Inc. in June 1996 and completed
it's initial public offering on December 6, 1996. 
<P>
Today, Powerwave's Products are currently being utilized
in <STRONG>Cellular</STRONG> and <STRONG>PCS</STRONG> base stations in both 
digital and analog-based networks.
Powerwave's Products can also be found in the <STRONG>SMR</STRONG> marketplace,
which is characterized as a two-way radio market with devices
commonly utilized by the business dispatch marketplace. 
<P>
<STRONG>Powerwave Amplifies Quality! </STRONG>
<P>
Powerwave's 300 plus employees are intensely quality-minded
and the Company strives to provide its customers with the most
reliable amplifier products available in the market today. Powerwave
is an ISO 9001 certified company, highlighting
the Company's focus on maintaining a consistent global standard
for quality processes and high quality products.
<P>
<STRONG>Powerwave's Products</STRONG>
<P>
Powerwave's amplifiers, which are key components
in wireless communication networks, increase the signal strength
of wireless transmissions while reducing interference or &quot;noise.&quot;
The reduction of noise enables wireless service providers to offer
improved service to subscribers through clearer call connections
with less interference. Increasing the signal strength of wireless
transmissions also improves service by reducing the number of
interrupted or dropped calls. Powerwave's RF power amplifiers
achieve ultra-linearity at increased levels of amplification through
the Company's proprietary application of &quot;feedforward&quot; technology which enables
the Company's multi-carrier power amplifiers to significantly
reduce RF interference thereby increasing the efficiency of the
wireless service providers network. Powerwave's products support a
wide range of digital and analog transmission protocols including
CDMA, TDMA, GSM, AMPS and TACS.
<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Powerwave Technologies, Inc. was incorporated
in Delaware in January 1985 under the name Milcom International,
Inc. and changed its name to Powerwave Technologies, Inc. in June
1996. The Company's headquarters and principal place of business
is located at 2026 McGaw Avenue, Irvine, California 92614, and

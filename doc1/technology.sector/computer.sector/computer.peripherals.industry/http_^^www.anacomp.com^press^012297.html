    FileNet and Anacomp Join To Provide Information Delivery Software
                             Applications

Alliance Between Global Leaders To Result In Application For Customer Service,
         Other Vertical Solutions For Departments and the Enterprise

    SAN DIEGO and COSTA MESA, Calif., Jan. 22 /PRNewswire/ -- Anacomp, Inc.
(Nasdaq: ANCO), a leader in information delivery systems and services, and
FileNet Corp. (Nasdaq: FILE), a leader in enterprise document management
software, announced today a multi-year product and marketing partnership to
provide Windows(R) NT-based software applications for integrated information
delivery.
    FileNet's newest suite of document management and workflow software, a set
of integrated, open, componentized and complementary solutions, will serve as
the platform for vertical applications developed and marketed by Anacomp under
the name Concerto(TM).  The first of these, called Concerto Customer Response
System (CRS), will provide organizations with significant improvements for
managing information for customer service operations.
    Based on the Windows NT operating system, Concerto CRS will employ
industry standards for storage and networking, and compatibility with
applications such as Microsoft(R) Word and Microsoft Excel.
    Concerto CRS will be delivered in mid 1997.  An initial version of the
solution, developed with resources from both companies, is now in alpha test
in Anacomp's Customer Service Center in San Diego, Calif.
    "This represents an alliance of strategies as much as an agreement between
companies," said Ted Smith, president and CEO, FileNet.  "For FileNet, it
represents an opportunity to both reinforce our position as a technological
leader in document management software, and propel the wider adoption of
workflow-based applications.  We also recognize that Computer Output to
Micrographics (COM), in which Anacomp is a world leader, holds a critical
place in companies' data migration strategies as a safe and reliable option
for the long term archiving of information."
    "Our relationship with FileNet is representative of Anacomp's expanded
investment in technology as well as our growing focus on application
solutions," said Ralph Koehrer, who was appointed to the position of president
and C00 at Anacomp in December.  "We expect this relationship with FileNet,
our continued leadership in COM and other related initiatives to be the basis
for our continuing to deliver valuable solutions to our most important asset,
our customers.  This is an excellent example of the new Anacomp."
    "We believe that FileNet has developed an outstanding technological
platform," said Ray Dicasali, chief technology officer, Anacomp.  "In
partnering with FileNet, we join forces with a company that is the first to
combine the technologies of imaging, workflow, COLD and document management
into a truly integrated Windows NT environment."
    New applications and upgrades are expected during the next year, the
companies said.  "The result is a sophisticated, easy-to-use application
supported by a highly integrated software platform, running on industry
standard hardware and operating systems," added Kevin M. O'Neill, senior vice
president of global marketing, Anacomp.
    Anacomp will market Concerto CRS through direct and indirect channels to
current and prospective customers in the United States, as well as regions in
Asia, Europe, Central and South America, the companies said.  Anacomp
currently serves approximately 15,000 customers in 65 countries, including
many of the Fortune 500 leaders in finance and banking, insurance, retail and
manufacturing.
    The products will be supported by Anacomp through its major customer
service hub in San Diego, California, and through its subsidiary operations
around the world.  The two companies will cooperate in sales and marketing
activities with related technical support resources.

    Concerto CRS
    Concerto CRS is intended to streamline customer service processes by
providing immediate, indexed access to all appropriate customer information,
regardless of document type.  More than simply a central repository for
customer information, Concerto CRS provides an integrated application for
customer service environments by giving hundreds of users direct access to all

telephony interface, exception processing, legacy system interface,
transaction history and support of 3211 line data, IBM Advanced Function
Presentation and Xerox Intelligent Printer Data Streams, among other features.
Specific versions will include report mining, image embedding, batch scanning
and other high-performance functionality.
    Costa Mesa, Calif.-based FileNet Corp. delivers to corporate and
government organizations a "Foundation for Enterprise Document Management"(TM)

management, and COLD (computer output to laser disk) client/server software
solutions.  The company's FileNet, Greenbar, Saros(R), and Watermark(R)

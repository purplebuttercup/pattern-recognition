(NASDAQ: RDUS), a pioneer and award winning producer of graphical and digital video systems today announced Radius EditDV 1.0&#153;, a breakthrough editing system that brings professional-level, 100% digital non-linear editing to the desktop.</P><P>EditDV, a complete software application for the video and creative professional, combines the first end-to-end DV format editing solution with extraordinary price performance.  Along with sophisticated editing and QuickTime&reg; compatibility,  Radius EditDV includes a host of impressive features that boost efficiency and ensure unimpeded creative flow.  DraftDV&#153;, a unique rendering mode, allows the editor to produce VHS-quality drafts three to five times faster than fully rendered video.  SoftDV&#153;, Radius EditDV's scalable playback software codec, allows users to view different levels of resolution.  LiveDV&#153; turns QuickTime movies into full motion over FireWire&reg;, and non-square pixel rendering eliminates distortion in the rendering process.  Radius EditDV also includes MotoDV&#153;, Radius's award-winning digital capture software.</P><P>"We believe that Radius EditDV will do for video what Adobe Photoshop&reg; did for photography," said Mark Housley, Radius president and CEO.  "By leveraging the power of the PC, Radius EditDV offers the video professional a breakthrough technology that will only get better as QuickTime and the PowerPC take off, making professional production on the desktop a reality."</P><P>Radius EditDV enables the video editor to perform sophisticated editing at the desktop.  Designed for new DV editors as well as graphics and video professionals ready to enter the DV space, Radius EditDV integrates editing, compositing, animation, and special effects functions into a single environment, available at the desktop, delivering high value at a minimal price.  By using Radius EditDV either on its own or in conjunction with the post-house, editors of all levels can create complete projects within a single professional non-linear DV editing application.</P><P>"Our mission," said Joe Klingler, Radius vice president of video engineering and a pioneer in video technology, "is to democratize video production by bringing the power of post-production-house equipment to the professional at the desktop."  </P><P>The $999 software application empowers users to harness the combined power of the latest camcorders, Apple's QuickTime (the industry standard architecture for digital media), FireWire connection capability (IEEE 1394 standard), and the speed of the new CPUs for a total workstation system cost of about $6,000 - $7,000.  The $25,000 - $50,000 price point of high-end equipment no longer prevents the budget conscious video professional from diving into all-digital editing.</P><P></P><P>Users can create DV video with multiple video and effects tracks, rubber-band audio, and traditional wipes and fades for fast interactive editing, color modification, keying, and true DVE.  Professionals who have dreamed of starting their own businesses or of delving into a new medium, but who have felt constrained by the high price of post-production house equipment, can now enter a new realm of creative and professional opportunity.</P><H3>A Host of Impressive Features Boost Efficiency and Unleash Creativity</H3><P>Full-quality desktop rendering takes time and can interrupt the creative process.  But Radius EditDV increases editors' productivity and creativity with software that reduces rendering time for VHS-quality previews.  A unique feature of Radius EditDV's sophisticated software, the DraftDV rendering mode makes it possible to process VHS quality previews three to five times faster than full broadcast resolution.  This makes it possible for editors to work efficiently: watching their work as it unfolds and communicating their preliminary versions to clients.  With DraftDV, editors gain a professional edge.</P><P>The Macintosh and post-house-style intuitive interface, with support for both single- and dual-monitors, facilitates the entire editing experience.</P><P><IMG SRC="../img/EditDV_interface.jpg" ALT="EditDV 1.0" WIDTH="420" HEIGHT="290" BORDER="0"><BR>EditDV Features a Macintosh-based Post House-style Intuitive Interface</P><P>SoftDV, Radius EditDV's scalable playback software codec (compressor-decompressor), works alongside DraftDV to increase efficiency and aid in creative flow.  During rendering, DV information must be decompressed, altered, and then recompressed in a process controlled by the DV editing system's codec.  Because rendering quality is only as good as the system's codec, Radius provides SoftDV, a high quality software codec optimized for the DV format.  SoftDV allows the user to select the view mode best suited to his system, such as: full quality in still mode; intermediate quality in scrub mode; or draft quality in play mode.  Professionals can decide how they want to work based on their creative needs.</P><P><IMG SRC="../img/EditDV_draft.jpg" ALT="EditDV 1.0 in Draft Mode VIew" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="253" BORDER="0"><BR>EditDV 1.0 in Draft Mode View</P><P><IMG SRC="../img/EditDV_intmed.jpg" ALT="EditDV 1.0 in Intermediate Mode View" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="253" BORDER="0"><BR>EditDV 1.0 in Intermediate Mode View</P><P><IMG SRC="../img/EditDV_full.jpg" ALT="EditDV 1.0 in Full Mode View" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="253" BORDER="0"><BR>EditDV 1.0 in Full Mode View</P><P>SoftDV also allows production flexibility.  When a company's camcorder is away in the field, the editor can continue to work anywhere there is a workstation.  And when the DV device is attached, its hardware codec provides full motion, full-screen playback of the digital footage via FireWire. </P><P>The software's LiveDV feature allows editors to interact with clips and review work on a full-sized monitor at full resolution.  Non-square pixel rendering eliminates distortion in the rendering process, so that material for video tape, CD-ROM or the Web maintains its proper aspect ratio.</P><P>To capture video, Radius EditDV includes MotoDV, its award-winning motion video software that controls the DV device so that editors can easily select the footage they need and launch it quickly.  MotoDV offers real-time capture through a small memory footprint that eliminates additional hardware costs.  MotoDV efficiently captures digital video frames and provides real-time delivery of the DV data stream over FireWire while automatically converting captured clips to QuickTime movies.  With MotoDV, users create folders of clips that they can then simply drag into the EditDV project window.  FireWire consolidates the entire operation, providing bi-directional video and audio control, and DV device control over a single, easy-to-install cable. </P><H3>A Sophisticated Array of Editing Features:  100 % End-to-End Digital</H3> <P>While Radius EditDV is accessible to the non-linear newcomer, the experienced editor will recognize the same kind of flexible user interface and sophisticated editing features found in more expensive equipment.  Working within the parameters of familiar Macintosh direct manipulation and drag-and-drop, Radius EditDV 1.0 boasts professional-style 3-point editing, including back-timing and fit-to-fill.  Unlimited title layers include ATM, TrueType, and GX fonts.  Title effects also include extensive keyframe control of drop shadows, gradients, softness, transparency and colored backgrounds providing complete control for creating professional titles.  Alpha mode is included for picture-in-title effects. Titles can be animated directly on the video using keyframed spline, linear, or hold motion.</P><P>With Pan Zoom Rotate (PZR), editors can manipulate their video in 3D with true perspective and support for soft, translucent, full-color drop shadows, anti-aliasing, automatic border generation and sub-pixel interpolation, providing broadcast-quality visual effects.</P><P>Radius EditDV provides unlimited keyframes for all effects filters - allowing not only motion control, but control of all filter parameters - giving the editor complete control of included effects and the ability to create his own effects.  With Chroma and Luma keying, the user can create clean mattes for unlimited layering of video without leaving the editing environment.  Chroma keying offers softness, transparency, and tolerance sliders for accurate keying performance.  Radius EditDV also provides a color replace filter for professional keying capability.</P><P><IMG SRC="../img/EditDV_effects.jpg" ALT="EditDV 1.0 special effects example" WIDTH="321" HEIGHT="240" BORDER="0"><BR>EditDV 1.0 Features a Range of Broadcast-quality Effects</P><P>Unlimited video and filter layers allow editors to layer as many video tracks and filter tracks as they need to achieve a desired effect.  And Radius EditDV allows users to conveniently  save filters - editors can reuse and exchange their work, saving time and money.  </P><H3>The Audio Advantage</H3><P>With Radius EditDV, audio also gets full attention.  The system provides locked and unlocked synchronized DV at DV standard rates, including 32, 44.1, and 48 kHz.  Radius EditDV provides real-time multi-track, synchronized playback with Live DV preview.  And when rendering DV and sound, Audio Rubber-Banding allows editors to directly manipulate the audio track volume to integrate diverse audio tracks and easily mix audio, producing smooth transitions.</P><H3>Radius DV Products</H3><P>Radius EditDV 1.0 is the latest in a family of award-winning Radius DV applications that have been among the first DV/FireWire products designed for Mac&reg;OS.  PhotoDV digitally captures still images from DV devices over FireWire with results that are ideal for both Web pages and printed media.  Its motion counterpart, MotoDV, provides real-time digital capture of the DV data stream, automatically converting captured clips into QuickTime movies.  Both PhotoDV and MotoDV provide remote deck control of the DV device from the computer.</P><H3>Availability and Price</H3><P>Radius EditDV 1.0 is now available and is shipping at a suggested price of $999 (including MotoDV and the Radius FireWire card and cable).  Current PhotoDV and MotoDV customers will be able to easily upgrade their systems to EditDV (Radius MotoDV and PhotoDV are each currently offered for $499 US suggested retail price and include the Radius FireWire card and cable).  Pricing outside the United States is set by Radius's international partners.   </P><P>Radius EditDV will be demonstrated in the Radius booth (#109) at the DV Expo in Burbank, California October 21-23.</P><P>Founded in 1986 and based in Sunnyvale, California, Radius Inc. offers the highest quality digital video solutions, Super Resolution and 2D and 2D/3D graphics cards, professional color calibrated display systems and PC compatibility cards.

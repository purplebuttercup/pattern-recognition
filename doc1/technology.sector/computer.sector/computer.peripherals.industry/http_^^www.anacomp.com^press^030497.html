    Anacomp Introduces Client/Server Application for 'Point and Click' 
                Document Image Archiving to Microfilm

    New Application Employs Industry Standards to Deliver TIFF Images
                  to World's Most Popular COM System

    SAN DIEGO, March 4 /PRNewswire/ -- Anacomp, Inc. (Nasdaq: <font color="#FF0000">ANCO</font>), a leader
in information delivery systems and services, today announced the introduction
of Image Direct(TM), a standards-based client/server application for output of
document images directly to microfilm from desktop workstations, ensuring
safe, long-term document storage.
    Image Direct allows users of Windows(R) NT, Windows 95 and UNIX-based
networked workstations to quickly and easily select CCITT Group-4 (TIFF)
images, the popular bitmap format, for output using Anacomp's flagship
XFP2000(R) Computer Output to Microfilm (COM) system.  A supporting element of
Anacomp's information life cycle strategy integrating digital and analog
technologies, Image Direct is an ideal solution for organizations requiring
automated archiving of document images.
    Image Direct is delivered as an application to complement Anacomp's
Imaging Output Option, which allows the XFP2000 to process an integrated data
stream (IDS) for output to microfilm.  In concert with the introduction, the
company also announced it expects to soon deliver enhancements to its Imaging
Output Option to further increase throughput of TIFF images.  These
enhancements will allow applications incorporating TIFF images to fully
utilize the performance of the XFP2000's camera, the fastest available on any
COM system in the industry.
    "Our ongoing investment in COM continues to produce the fastest, most
versatile and easy-to-use COM systems available," said Kevin M. O'Neill,
senior vice president of global marketing, Anacomp.  "Our latest enhancement
to the XFP2000 family, Image Direct offers our customers a standards-based
solution for providing desktop archiving functionality for popular Group-4
images -- an ideal element for integration with workflow and document
management systems."

    Multiple Applications
    Image Direct enables organizations to output directly to microfilm
personnel records, customer invoices, patient records and other CCITT Group-4
images, providing a migration path from higher-cost media traditionally
employed in earlier stages of the information life cycle.  Due to its low
cost, small size, standardization and longevity, microfilm is an ideal storage
medium for long-term retention of key documents and records.
    An insurance company strengthening its data back-up and recovery strategy
(DBAR), for example, may choose Image Direct to create and maintain an analog
archive for its critical customer documents, stored as electronic images on
its workflow system.  Such an archive would make available these key documents
with only a light source and magnification, ensuring the business' continued
operation in a major disaster.
    A financial services company can take advantage of Image Direct's direct-
from-desktop archiving capabilities to facilitate the inexpensive storage of
vital financial records, often to meet legal requirements for document
retention.  Other applications include technology-independent archiving of
invoices and customer records for a manufacturer, and long-term storage of
clinical field trial data gathered by a pharmaceutical company.
    To initiate output to microfilm of documents, desktop workstation users
either drag and drop image files onto the Image Direct icon or select them by
highlighting file names.  Clicking a second icon encapsulates the images in
the required print stream format.  Lastly, by activating either a sweep of a
selected directory of a network hard drive or selecting the specific file, the
image is queued and transmitted via Ethernet link to the networked XFP2000
system.
    Considered the most advanced COM system available, more XFP2000's were
delivered in 1996 than any other COM system in the world.  According to the
November, 1996 issue of Micrographics Newletter, more COM end-users reported
using the XFP2000 than any other COM system.
    Image Direct is available now from Anacomp.  Integration of Image Direct
is offered in the U.S. by the Professional Services arm of Anacomp's
Technology Services Group; integration and support is provided through Anacomp
locations around the world.
    Image Direct is available in Windows 95, Windows NT (Version 3.51) and
UNIX (Sun Version 4.1.3 and Solaris Version 2.4) versions.  Future
enhancements are expected to include horizontal pagination capability and
compatibility with additional file formats.

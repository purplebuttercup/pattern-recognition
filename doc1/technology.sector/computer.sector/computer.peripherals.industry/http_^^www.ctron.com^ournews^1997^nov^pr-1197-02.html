<B>ROCHESTER, NH -- November 5, 1997 -- </B>Adding to its broad array of networking products already available to strategic Synergy Plus reseller partners, Cabletron Systems (NYSE:CS) today announced the availability of convenient, out-of-the-box service and <A HREF="/support/">support</A> packages through Ingram Micro, the world's largest wholesale distributor of technology products and services. This is the first time Cabletron services have been made available through the reseller channel.
<P>

Growing in popularity, the <A HREF="/programs/">Synergy Plus Program</A> was initiated to extend
Cabletron's premier networking solutions to the broader, "one-stop-shopping"
markets that distributors and resellers reach. Complementing the products
currently available through Ingram Micro are new Synergy Plus LANCare Service
and Support Packs. These pre-packaged services bring Cabletron's comprehensive
technical support to Ingram Micro resellers, who have had access to Cabletron's
full product line since the companies announced their distribution partnership
in March 1997.
<P>


"Cabletron has always offered superior, comprehensive technical support to each
and every one of our customers," said Ken Sullivan, Cabletron's director of
worldwide service and support. "Now resellers will have access to the same
world-class service via Ingram Micro. We think it makes sense for Cabletron to
target the reseller channel, which is extremely effective in the selling of
products and services."
<P>

Added Randy Jones, vice president of services for Ingram Micro, "We are pleased
to add Cabletron's Synergy Plus LANCare Service and Support Packs to our
extensive line-up of services. Now resellers can purchase Cabletron products and
the accompanying services all in one place. Whether resellers need pre-packaged
or custom services, we can provide them the exact solution they need."
<P>

<B>About Synergy Plus LANCare</B><BR>

Ingram Micro will distribute three distinct Synergy Plus <A HREF="/support/lancare/">LANCare Service</A> and
Support Packs for resale. Each one -- LANCare Standard, LANCare Plus and LANCare
Plus 7x24 -- is conveniently packaged to provide immediate, out-of-the-box
service. Easy-to-follow instructions and a registration form will activate the
account.
<P>

Each LANCare Service and Support Pack entitles a customer to receive:
 Around-the-clock technical telephone support through Cabletron's global call
center, providing accurate and timely responses to customer issues
 An on-line Cabletron Web account, providing 7x24 access to product revision and
release notes
 Immediate firmware upgrades, available via the Web for added convenience
 Advance replacements of Cabletron products, usually within the next business
day
<P>

Additionally, the LANCare Standard Service and Support Pack guarantees
customized troubleshooting from an on-site Cabletron field engineer within one
business day, Monday-Friday, from the time the problem was logged with
Cabletron's technical support. LANCare Plus guarantees an on-site engineer
within four hours, Monday-Friday, from the time the problem was logged, while LANCare Plus 7x24 guarantees
an on-site engineer within four hours, 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week.

             Anacomp Acquires Data/Ware Development
    Acquisition Makes Anacomp The Leader In CD Output Solutions

    ATLANTA, Jan. 31 /PRNewswire/ -- Anacomp, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANCO), a leader in
information delivery systems and services, today announced that it has
acquired all of the stock of Data/Ware Development, Inc., an industry-leading
provider of CD output systems, optical storage controllers, and mainframe
connectivity solutions.
    Data/Ware's flagship products, the Enterprise Authoring System (EAS)(R)
and the Server/Enterprise Authoring System (S/EAS), provide highly automated
output to CD-Recordable discs in both mainframe and client/server computing
environments.  One of Data/Ware's most popular solutions is a check imaging
application being used today by most of the largest U.S. banks, often in
conjunction with IBM's HPTS check processing system.  Other EAS and S/EAS
applications include the distribution of billing statements to corporate
clients, as well as large-volume report and document distribution.
Data/Ware's annual revenues are approximately $11 million.
    "The Data/Ware acquisition is absolutely synergistic with Anacomp's
strategic direction," stated Ralph W. Koehrer, Anacomp's recently appointed
president and chief operating officer.  "One of our top priorities is to bring
advanced technologies into Anacomp, and Data/Ware represents the best of
today's CD output system technology -- plus they have a head start on next-
generation DVD technology.  The Data/Ware products will mesh well with
Anacomp's other digital and analog information management solutions, and we're
confident they will be well received by our clients.  In fact, many of the
most likely candidates for Data/Ware's EAS and S/EAS solutions are Anacomp's
current Computer Output Microfilm (COM) customers.  And by bringing together
Data/Ware's products and Anacomp's growing ALVA(TM) CD services business, we
have quickly become the leading provider of CD output solutions."
    "All of us at Data/Ware are tremendously excited by the opportunity to be
part of Anacomp's future," commented Richard Keele, president of Data/Ware.
Keele has been appointed a senior vice president at Anacomp and group
president of Anacomp's new Data/Ware division, which will operate as a
strategic business unit.  "Anacomp has developed a strong and loyal customer
base, as well as an enviable worldwide sales and distribution channel.  Now,
with the addition of Data/Ware's CD output systems and related technologies,
along with the recent Anacomp/FileNet alliance, Anacomp is bringing together
the pieces to be the leader in integrated document management solutions."
    Anacomp and FileNet last week announced a multi-year product and marketing
relationship to provide Windows(R) NT-based software applications for
integrated information delivery.  FileNet's world-class document management
and workflow software will serve as the platform for Anacomp's development of
a suite of market-leading vertical applications under the name Concerto(TM).
    Although Data/Ware will operate as a strategic business unit of Anacomp,
significant cost synergies are expected from the integration of Data/Ware's
San Diego headquarters into Anacomp's U.S. headquarters in Poway, California,
just north of San Diego.  In addition, research and development efforts of the
two companies will be leveraged in order to maximize on-going and future
product development.  Data/Ware will maintain its direct sales force, along
with its network of resellers and distributors, including a distribution
agreement with Hitachi Data Systems in Europe.
    In addition to EAS and S/EAS, Data/Ware provides connectivity solutions
focused on mainframe-to-printer connectivity with Sun Microsystems SPARC(R)
Stations, as well as channel interface controllers for mainframe optical
storage systems that are sold directly by Data/Ware and also in combination
with some of the leading COLD and report distribution companies.
    "Along with their industry-leading products, DataWare has established
excellent strategic sales relationships with IBM, Sun Microsystems, and
Hitachi Data Systems in Europe," commented Kevin M. O'Neill, Anacomp's senior
vice president of global marketing.  "These relationships, together with the
systems and applications offered by these partners in conjunction with
Data/Ware, are highly valued by Anacomp.
     "In addition, Data/Ware's EAS and S/EAS products are a perfect complement
to Anacomp's own growing family of ALVA(TM) CD outsourcing services,"
continued O'Neill.  "While Data/Ware's products are ideal for in-house
installation of a large-volume document distribution solution, ALVA provides
outsourcing alternatives for those clients who prefer a services solution."
    "Data/Ware's substantial experience in the development of digital
technologies for high-volume applications will dramatically increase Anacomp's
knowledge base," added Ray L. Dicasali, Anacomp's chief technology officer.
"Combined with Anacomp's own technology expertise in data stream
transformation to COM and optical media, user applications, and more recently
digital user interfaces, we're now well positioned to develop document
management solutions across the information life cycle.  Data/Ware also brings
us significant research and development knowledge in emerging DVD technology,
which most industry analysts expect to become a major media storage option in
the not-too-distant future."
    Serving customers throughout the world, Anacomp provides products and
services that manage corporate information throughout its life cycle.

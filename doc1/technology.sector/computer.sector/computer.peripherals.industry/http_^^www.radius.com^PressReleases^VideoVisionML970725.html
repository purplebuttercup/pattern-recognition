<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Radius&#174; Ships VideoVision ML Setting New Price Performance for QTML Production on the Mac &#174;OS Desktop</H2>

<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Sunnyvale, CA, July 25, 1997</STRONG>--Radius Inc. (NASDAQ:RDUS) began shipping VideoVision ML&#153;  in volume earlier this month.  VideoVision ML is aggressively priced at a U.S. suggested retail price of $2,499, establishing a new price point for professional video production compared to competing offerings, which sell at a 50-100% premium. It provides full motion, full screen, realtime capture, playback and output to tape along with an unparalleled QuickTime solution that is ideally suited to the demands of media creators, editors and 3D designers who rely upon the scalability of both image size and data rate to efficiently produce movies for broadcast, 3D, the Web or CD-ROM.
<P>
VideoVision ML provides complete QuickTime functionality, allowing seamless work with any QuickTime- compatible 3D, editing or animation application. VideoVision ML also includes a frame buffer that provides a second desktop on a video monitor allowing graphic artists, animators and editors to work directly with their material in the correct NTSC or PAL color space on a flicker-free, video display. VideoVision ML enhances workflow by allowing users to capture quarter-screen media at any data-rate, saving both rendering time and disk space. This media can be output to tape at full size in realtime using hardware-based resizing to create draft copies and approval tapes for clients.  High-quality, quarter-screen media can also be used immediately in web or interactive productions.
<P>
Radius Edit 2.0, Radius' professional non-linear editing application, is included with VideoVision ML, providing the environment to efficiently integrate the many different types of media created on the Mac OS.  Radius Edit is designed to maximize workflow in the studio environment by providing integrated batch re-capture and EDL lists. VideoVision ML also includes an RGB component cable so that 3D designers can output animations at the highest quality to Betacam SP&#153; decks that provide component RGB input.
<P>
 "VideoVision ML provides the professional production capability and QuickTime integration required by today's media professionals," said Bud Koch, vice president of marketing at Radius. "The incredible new price point has been well received by the market and should increase the viability of video production and graphics integration on the desktop."

<B>PRODUCT FEATURES</B>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Compression ratios to 2:1</B> - PCI bus transfer rates now allow high quality video production at very low compression ratios. New on board encoder provides very high quality S-video.
<LI><B>Frame buffer / Convolution</B> - Allows customers to use their video monitor as desktop, making it easy to preview colors and interlacing on the output device before finalizing the project. 
<LI><B>Hardware synchronized audio</B> - On board hardware provides synchronization from a common clock for reliable audio synchronization in any length movie.
<LI><B>Adjustable capture size</B> - allows customers to capture only the size they need saving disk space and time.  This provides a perfect environment for proxy editing and creation of QuickTime movies not slated for tape.
<LI><B>SoftStudio&#153;</B> - SoftStudio is software technology, built by Radius, that allows users to view movies on any Mac, share media with others and render on any machine, even on those without video hardware installed.
<LI><B>Interpolated playback</B> - allows users to achieve the look of film on video when using high data rates and to create draft quality full frame movies with smaller frame sizes.  Creative professionals also utilize this feature to save time and disk space during the creative process for creating comps and drafts of 3D animations for client approval.
</UL>
<P>
VideoVision ML is designed for video and graphics professionals whose work demands the power and flexibility of complete QuickTime integration.  VideoVision ML is the ideal tool for customers who produce video or graphics for commercials, 3D animations, corporate video, and interactive CD-ROMs. Customers who currently own VideoVision Studio can trade it in for VideoVision ML by contacting Radius.

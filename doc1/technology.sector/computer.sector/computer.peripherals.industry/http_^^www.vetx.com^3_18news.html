<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>VERTEX INDUSTRIES, INC. REPORTS RESULTS FOR 2nd QUARTER</B></P>

<P>
Clifton, NJ, March 18, 1997 -- Vertex Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: VETX,
BOSTON: VER) reported net income of $44,486 or $0.01 per share on revenues
of $937,029 for the second quarter ended January 31, 1997 compared to a net
income of $103,239 or $0.02 on revenues of $1,041,620 a year ago. There
were 5,349,500  and 5,094,507 weighted average shares outstanding on
January 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.</P>

<P>As a result of the recently announced licensing agreement with The
NetWeave Corporation, Vertex has formed NetWeave Business Unit of Vertex,
which is located in Philadelphia and is being integrated into operations.
Sales, administration and development will remain as a stand alone unit
whereas accounting will be integrated into the existing Vertex system.
Vertex has presented its BridgeNet product to the European distributors of
NetWeave at a meeting recently held in the UK by SX Consultancy, NetWeave's
Master Distributor. There is a great deal of synergy between the NetWeave
and BridgeNet products.</P>

<P>According to Vertex President, Ron Byer, applications for the BridgeNet
product and the customer base continues to expand. Customers are requesting
solutions in areas in which the company has not previously had a product
offering. Two cases in point are labor cost management and fixed asset
tracking. These two application areas require a good data collection
management system to be efficient and that is where BridgeNet is very
strong. The sales cycle for these types of applications are longer because
customers are larger and therefore more effort is required to deal with a
larger group of people within the organization.</P>

<p>Cybex Computer Products Corporation manufactures and markets
products for computers that boost, split or switch the signals
between the central processing unit (CPU) and the keyboard, video
monitor and mouse (KVM). The Company's KVM switch, extension and
expansion products are designed to work on IBM and compatible
computers, Apple Macintosh, Sun, and certain Hewlett-Packard, IBM
and Silicon Graphics workstations.</p>

<p>The company's KVM switch products are used on network
computers and allow the user to control multiple computers with a
single keyboard, video monitor and mouse. Cybex's proprietary
AutoBoot Commander&trade; 4xP&nbsp;line of switch products enable
up to four users to control as many as 2,160 computers. The
switch products increase user productivity while providing
substantial savings in reduced computer components and energy
costs.</p>

<p>Cybex's KVM extension products allow the computer's CPU to be
separated from the keyboard, video monitor and mouse by up to 600
feet. The company's KVM extension products are used to increase
space for the user by moving the CPU to a remote location,
provide increased security by moving the CPU off the user's desk
to a secure location, and are used to remove the CPU from
hazardous locations, such as plant floors, to a more protected
environment.</p>

<p>The company also produces KVM expansion products that allow
multiple keyboards, monitors and mice to be connected to a single
computer. Application for KVM expansion products include
classrooms where the teacher and/or students can view the other's
work, and in applications where the user needs access to the
computer from multiple locations. Cybex's KVM expansion products
do not require special network software or multiple software
licenses since the system is designed to work off of a single
CPU.</p>

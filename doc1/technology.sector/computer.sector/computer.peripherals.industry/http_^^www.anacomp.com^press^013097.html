        Anacomp Announces Improved First Quarter Financial Results

    ATLANTA, Jan. 30 /PRNewswire/ --  Anacomp, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANCO) today
released first quarter financial results for the period ended
December 31, 1996 that reflect improved EBITDA (earnings before interest,
taxes, other income and expenses, reorganization items, depreciation, and
amortization).
    For the three months ended December 31, 1996 (Anacomp's first quarter of
fiscal 1997), the company reported EBITDA of $23.3 million or 20% of revenues,
compared to $18.0 million or 16% of revenues in the previous quarter, and
$23.1 million or 18% of revenues in the comparable period a year ago.
Contributing to the first quarter improvement was a $3.6 million payment
relating to a long-standing OEM purchase agreement for Anacomp's leading XFP
2000 COM technology, sales of newer digital products, and continued reductions
in operating expenses.  Without the one-time $3.6 million payment, first
quarter EBITDA would have been $19.7 million.
    Revenues for the period were $116.5 million, compared to $114.8 million in
the previous quarter and $130.3 million in the comparable period a year ago.
The first quarter results reflect the $3.6 million payment noted above,
further stabilization of some of the company's maturing traditional
micrographics and magnetics businesses, and modest new revenues from the
company's emerging digital solutions.  The revenue decline from the first
quarter a year ago was primarily due to Anacomp's exit of certain non-
strategic businesses, as well as negative revenue trends during the period in
segments of the company's maturing businesses.
    As a result of Anacomp's successful financial restructuring and emergence
from Chapter 11 last year, Anacomp is amortizing over three-and-a-half years a
"reorganization value" asset of approximately $263 million. This non-cash
reorganization amortization was $19.2 million in the first quarter, resulting
in a net loss of $12.9 million.  That compares to a net loss of $17.6 in the
previous quarter (Anacomp's first quarter post-Chapter 11).  As mentioned
above, those results are not comparable to the first quarter of fiscal 1996
(all of which occurred pre-Chapter 11).
    "We're very pleased with our first quarter performance," stated Lang
Lowrey, Anacomp's chairman and chief executive officer.  "Not only did we see
some unexpected success in some of our newer products and services, but our
EBITDA remained steady for the third consecutive quarter -- even backing-out
the $3.6 million first quarter payment relating to our XFP 2000 OEM
arrangement."
    "We also completed three relatively small acquisitions in the first
quarter," continued Lowrey, "including a COM service bureau that strengthened
our market position in the New York area, an archival storage vault in
Massachusetts, and a computer peripheral equipment company that provides us
with synergies for both our maintenance and magnetics businesses.  Plus, we
successfully completed a $25 million rights offering, providing us with
significant additional resources to invest in the acquisition of
businesses and technologies.  Our acquisition focus going forward will be on
products and services that expand our current business relationships and that
bring advanced technologies into the company."
    The first quarter also saw the appointment of Ralph W. Koehrer of
Automatic Data Processing, Inc. as Anacomp's new president and chief operating
officer.  "In reviewing the first quarter results, I see several significant
challenges but also real opportunities and a solid foundation from which to
grow Anacomp's business in the future," said Koehrer.  "As an example, our new
Technology Services Group in the United States performed particularly well in
the first quarter, and I'm optimistic about opportunities in this area,
especially as it relates to providing our customers with expanded professional
consulting services."  Koehrer officially assumed his new duties on
January 6, 1997.

services that manage corporate information throughout its life cycle.

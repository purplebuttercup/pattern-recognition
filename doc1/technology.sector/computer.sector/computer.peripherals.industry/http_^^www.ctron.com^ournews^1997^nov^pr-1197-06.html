in providing dependable network access and communications to millions of people
throughout the world, today announced that its MMAC-Plus switching platform
earned top honors in a November review of chassis-based switches by Network
Solutions magazine.

With a five-star overall rating, the MMAC-Plus led the test -- ahead of Cisco's
Catalyst 5500, ODS' Networks InfiniteSwitch 6012 and 3Com's CoreBuilder 5000. 
The chassis-based systems were tested on features including backbone throughput
and port density.  The publication also rated the MMAC-Plus an excellent choice
for data center or wiring closet solutions, highlighting the chassis ability to
incorporate Ethernet, Fast/Gigabit Ethernet, Token Ring, FDDI and ATM through
easy interchangeable modules.

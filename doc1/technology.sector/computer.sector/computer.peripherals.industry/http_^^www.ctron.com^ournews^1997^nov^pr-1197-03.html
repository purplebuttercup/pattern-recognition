<b>ROCHESTER, NH -- November 10, 1997 -- </b>Moving forward with its industry-unique convergence strategy for melding <A HREF="/products/">LAN</A> and <A HREF="/wan/">WAN</A> capabilities, Cabletron Systems (NYSE: CS) announced today the availability of Remote Access Modules  for its flagship <A HREF="/mmac-plus/">MMAC-Plus</A> multimedia switching platform.
<P>
Using the new 9W006 and 9W007 Remote Access Modules with the MMAC-Plus provides
customers with a simple, reliable, cost-effective central site solution to
support dial-in connectivity for corporate telecommuters, remote offices, mobile
intranet users, and service provider clients. 
<P>
Today's announcement, along with the previously announced <A HREF="/products/items/HSIM-W6/">HSIM-W6</A> WAN uplink
module, is another in a series of new offerings that will allow Cabletron's
award-winning SmartSwitch architecture to extend to the WAN. The same advanced
management, scalability, and security features that support Cabletron's 
Ethernet, 
Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, <A HREF="/atm/">ATM</A>, FDDI, and Token Ring technologies, are now
applicable to ISDN, analog modem, frame relay, leased line, and X.25 from the
same chassis.
<P>
Cabletron's tight merging  of WAN and LAN switching is in stark contrast to
other industry solutions which focus on router technology. Unlike the router
architecture, the Cabletron Remote Access Modules, as well as the HSIM-W6,
provide remote and branch sites with a non-blocking architecture, the capability
to scale as networks grow, comprehensive management of remote access
implementation and traffic-flow, and the 
unrivaled ability to apply switched-based auto-learning configuration to remote
access.  
<P>

Implementing remote access from a centralized router with added LAN interfaces
requires manual configuration of devices, offer only a fraction of the total
bandwidth capacity at any given time, does not scale well for growing networks,
cannot keep running when a functional failure occurs, and does not offer
comprehensive manageability. 
<P>
Cabletron is providing a unique value proposition with its LAN extension
capabilities," said Craig Johnson of Current Analysis. "No other vendor can
offer customers the ability to connect remote users to a switched LAN
infrastructure while taking advantage of the same advanced features provided to
their local users."
<P>
"Cabletron's integrated LAN and WAN technology not only eliminates customer need
for added rack, floor and cabling space, but also additional management,
automation, and security features," said Chris Oliver, director of manufacturing
& engineering at Cabletron. "Cabletron's LAN/WAN solution frees customers  from
much of the usual physical space, time, and personnel resource requirements
needed to set up and managing remote access capabilities."
<P>
The Remote Access Modules provide layer 2 and multiprotocol layer 3 switching as
well as bandwidth-on-demand and network layer spoofing to optimally move
information between central sites and dial-in users. WAN protocol support
includes PPP, Asynch-PPP, and MultiLink-PPP, and robust security is provided via
several mechanisms including PAP, CHAP, RADIUS, TACACS, and Security Dynamic's
ACE/SecurID. <P>
The modules are hot swappable and auto-configurable to support mission critical
on-demand networking; fully interoperable with leading remote site ISDN
equipment, such as the Cabletron CyberSWITCH family, as well as with leading
analog modems; and can be managed with Cabletron's <A HREF="/spectrum/">SPECTRUM Enterprise Manager</A>.

<P>

The 9W006 and 9W007 Remote Access Modules will be available January 1998.
Pricing and functionality are as follows:

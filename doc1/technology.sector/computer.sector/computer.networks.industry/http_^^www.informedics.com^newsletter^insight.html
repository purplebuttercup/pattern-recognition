This         year's fee was only $200 for a full five days of training,         including fun lunches delivered right to the classroom and a         heck of a good time for all involved.</FONT></P>                  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#0000AF">         <HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE>         </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000000">Table of         Contents</FONT></B></CENTER></P>                  <UL>            <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"            COLOR="#AF0000"><A HREF="page2.html">Getting to Know our            CSR's</A></FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000"><BR>                        </FONT></B>                        <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"            COLOR="#AF0000"><A HREF="page2.html#memory">Maximising            your Memory</A></FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000"><BR>                        </FONT></B>                        <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"            COLOR="#AF0000"><A HREF="page3.html">Hail to the New            Chief</A></FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000"><BR>                        </FONT></B>                        <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"            COLOR="#AF0000"><A HREF="page4.html">Key to Saving            Time</A></FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000"><BR>                        </FONT></B>                        <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"            COLOR="#AF0000"><A HREF="page4.html#deal">What's the Real            Deal</A></FONT>         </UL>                  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#0000AF">         <HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE>         </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"         COLOR="#000000">Informedics, Inc. </FONT><B><FONT         COLOR="#000000"><BR>                  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"         COLOR="#000000">4000 Kruse Way Place, </FONT><B><FONT         COLOR="#000000"><BR>                  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"         COLOR="#000000">Bldg. 3 Suite 210</FONT><B><FONT         COLOR="#000000"><BR>                  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"         COLOR="#000000">Lake Oswego, OR 97035</FONT></CENTER></P>                  <P>&nbsp;      </TD><TD VALIGN=top ROWSPAN=2 COLSPAN=2>         <P><CENTER><IMG SRC="images/group.jpg" WIDTH=370 HEIGHT=236         X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=1 ALIGN=top>         </CENTER></P>                  <BLOCKQUOTE><P><CENTER><B>The Advanced Training Participants         and the Informedics trainers.</B></CENTER></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#0000AF">During the week of June 24 through         June 28 we were pleased to host 14 of our StarPath Users         from around the country for the annual StarPath Advanced         Training Session. Nine sites were represented, ranging from         Delaware to Hawaii. The training was held at our corporate         office and was received with resounding success (see         comments left). Our full class schedule ranged from a review         of basic StarPath functionality to detailed DOS and NetWare         Q&amp;A sessions to lectures on generated reports and the         automatic FAX feature.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#0000AF">Advanced Training allows our Users         to meet one another and discuss common issues in the world         of pathology as well as how StarPath can be used to optimize         pathology lab functions. Class sizes were limited to just         nine people this year, greatly improving the participants'         ability to focus&nbsp;on the lectures, ask questions, and         discuss the materials being covered. We also provided more         classes broken down into smaller increments to allow for         greater flexibility for those customers who were unable to         attend the entire week and wanted to maximize their         time.</FONT></P>                  <P><FONT COLOR="#0000AF">The User's Group also elected         replacement officers during the week of training. Steve         Herrman of Providence Hospital in Cincinnati is the group's         new President, Dr. Susan Donnelly of MedLab in Delaware is         Vice President, and Sonia Jatho of Williamsburg Community         Hospital in Virginia will serve as Secretary. Many thanks to         the Users who participated and best of luck in arranging         future User's Group activities!</FONT></P>                  <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT         COLOR="#0000AF"><A HREF="page2.html"><IMG         SRC="images/next.gif" WIDTH=73 HEIGHT=48 X-SAS-UseImageWidth         X-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=0 ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT>         </BLOCKQUOTE>      </TD></TR>   <TR></TR></TABLE></CENTER></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P><CENTER><MAP NAME="bar">   <AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="345,39,378,84" HREF="../index.html">   <AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="266,15,324,83" HREF="../investor.html">   <AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="207,13,258,80" HREF="../employment.html">   <AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="144,14,191,80" HREF="../lsp.html">   <AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="78,10,131,78" HREF="../ids.html">   <AREA SHAPE=RECT COORDS="15,5,70,78" HREF="../profile.html"></MAP><IMG USEMAP="#bar" SRC="../bar2.gif" WIDTH=381 HEIGHT=101X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight BORDER=0 ALIGN=bottom></CENTER></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BODY></HTML>

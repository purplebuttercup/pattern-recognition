<B>Cerner’s process-oriented approach</B> to the management of health has direct 
international application for our solutions. Very early in our history, 
Cerner identified what we call "The Core Clinical Process", and have 
architected our solutions to fit that process.
<P>
<B>The Core Clinical Process is essential:</B>
<UL>
	<LI>A person with a health need engages a provider of health services.
	<LI>An assessment of that person’s situation is made by the provider.
	<LI>A plan of action is developed based on that assessment.
	<LI>That plan is executed.
	<LI>The results of the executed plan are evaluated.
	<LI>Based on that evaluation, the person is dismissed or referred for additional health services.
	<LI>Depending upon the person’s status at that point, the cycle either will continue or it will repeat itself at some time in the future upon an incidence of a new health need.
</UL>
<B>This process is universal</B>. Not only does it take place in all cultures and 
countries, it is relevant for the entire spectrum of health engagements: from a 
wellcare visit at a clinic, to an emergency or in-patient encounter at a hospital, 
to a home visit by a practitioner, to a telemedicine consultation done across many 
miles.
<P>
<B>Cerner’s expertise</B> at managing health status in a multifacility and 
multidisciplinary environment - across the broad continuum of care - has brought 
our solutions to the attention of health services providers worldwide. We have 
implemented solutions across the globe. <B>Cerner currently has offices in the United 
States, United Kingdom, Germany, Singapore, Australia and Saudi Arabia</B>. Additionally, 
Cerner reached an agreement in 1996 with Siemens Health Services, Inc., 
through which Siemens is our exclusive partner to market and install systems for 
clients in Europe.
<P>

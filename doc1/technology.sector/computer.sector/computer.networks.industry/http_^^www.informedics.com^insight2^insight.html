We recognized the need to         focus our efforts around a suite of products that are         complementary in their architecture and national market         appeal. Therefore, we have decided to sell our ClinicManager         product line. This decision will allow us to concentrate on         the development and support of our LifeLine, StarPath and         IntraMed.net product lines.</P>                  <P>In looking for a potential buyer for this part of our         business, we were driven by three important divestiture         requirements: what would be best for our customers; what         would be best for our employees; and what would be fair for         our stockholders. Fortunately, we were able to find a         winning solution for everyone concerned in Adaptive Health         Systems. Our customers win because their investment in         ClinicManager will be fully protected as they will not have         to change systems and they will continue to be supported by         the same people that understand their needs and history. Our         employees win as the entire ClinicManager service and         support team has been offered jobs at Adapative at a         location close to Informedics, with no loss in pay, benefits         or seniority. Our stockholders win as the company's         resources and staff will be dedicated and focused for         success to achieve our strategic marketing and sales         objectives.</P>                  <P>We will miss our ClinicManager customers and staff, but         are confident that everyone will prosper by this carefully         considered decision.</P>                  <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#0000AF">         <HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="90%" NOSHADE>         </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#000000">Table of         Contents</FONT></B></CENTER></P>                  <UL>            <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"            COLOR="#AF0000"><A HREF="page2.html">Healthcare            Connection to the 21st Century</A></FONT><B><FONT            COLOR="#AF0000"><BR>                        </FONT></B>                        <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"            COLOR="#AF0000"><A HREF="page3.html">Welcome            Aboard</A></FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#AF0000"><BR>                        </FONT></B>                        <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"            COLOR="#AF0000"><A HREF="page4.html">1997 Trade Show            Calendar</A></FONT>         </UL>                  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica" COLOR="#0000AF">         <HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="90%" NOSHADE>         </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"         COLOR="#000000">Informedics, Inc. </FONT><B><FONT         COLOR="#000000"><BR>                  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"         COLOR="#000000">4000 Kruse Way Place, </FONT><B><FONT         COLOR="#000000"><BR>                  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"         COLOR="#000000">Bldg. 3 Suite 210</FONT><B><FONT         COLOR="#000000"><BR>                  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Helvetica"         COLOR="#000000">Lake Oswego, OR 97035</FONT></CENTER>      </TD><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH="40%">         <P><TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=1>            <TR>               <TD>                  <P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="+1">It's a Big World                  after all at AABB, Orlando</FONT></B></CENTER></P>                                    <P><FONT COLOR="#0000AF">It was wonderful to see so                  many of our customers at the AABB Conference in                  October.

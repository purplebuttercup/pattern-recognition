<UL>SAN DIEGO, Aug. 5,1997 – DAOU Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:DAOU) announced

shares of common stock, of which 500,000 shares will be sold by the company
and 1,500,000 shares will be sold by certain selling stockholders. DAOU

by the selling stockholders.

<P>Hambrecht &amp; Quist LLC will lead manage the underwriting group; Alex.Brown

and the selling stockholders also will grant to the underwriters an option
to purchase up to 300,000 shares of common stock solely to cover over-allotments,
if any.

<P>DAOU Systems plans to use the proceeds of the offering principally for
working capital and general corporate purposes. The compay also anticipates
using a portion of the proceeds to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses,
although there are no current arrangements or understandings with respect
to any specific acquisitions.

<P>These securities are offered only by means of a prospectus, a copy of

be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time that the registration
statement becomes effective. This press release shall not constitute an
offer to sell nor the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there
be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such
an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration

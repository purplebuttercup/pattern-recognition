<UL>SAN DIEGO, July 7, 1997 -- DAOU Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq: DAOU) and VHA
Inc. of Irving, Texas., announced today the formation of a marketing alliance.&nbsp;
Through the agreement, as one of VHA’s preferred information systems integration
vendors, DAOU will provide computer network design, implementation and
support services to VHA members, which comprise 1,500 leading community
healthcare organizations in the United States, including 22 percent of
the nation’s community hospitals.
<BR>Under the terms of the agreement, DAOU will provide VHA members with
the company’s core network design, implementation and support services
at highly competitive rates. DAOU will also endorse and support VHA.seCURE.net?,
a secure, private information network that provides a communications and
collaboration platform for VHA members and their key partners, such as
community physicians and suppliers. Additionally, DAOU will sponsor VHA-member
user groups to provide best practices information, research and training
on new network technologies.

<P>In return, DAOU will have easier access to all of VHA’s members and
decision makers, as well as the opportunity to participate in marketing
programs to all VHA members and affiliates. The company will also be invited
to attend VHA’s national and regional conferences.

<P>“This agreement benefits DAOU, VHA and its many community healthcare
providers,” said Robert McNeill, executive vice president and chief operating
officer for DAOU Systems. “We look forward to playing a strategic role
in ensuring that VHA members have advanced, up-to-date computer networks
in place. We view ourselves as a scaleable resource willing to work with
members in addressing network infrastructure issues that may arise as they
move to integrated healthcare delivery systems.”

<P>James Burgess, vice president of information technology solutions at
VHA, said, “We identified a need among our membership to build and enhance
their network infrastructures to support advanced technology applications,
especially applications that require large bandwidths, and to expand their
communications capabilities. We think DAOU’s unique combination of&nbsp;
networking and health care expertise clearly differentiates it from other
networking companies.”

<P>VHA&nbsp; is a nationwide network of more than 1,500 leading community-owned
health care organizations -- including 1,200 hospitals -- and their affiliated
physicians.&nbsp; The VHA network comprises 22 percent of the nation’s
community hospitals and serves 26 percent of the nation’s patients. In

In 1983 the company firstoffered its <A HREF="lsp/lifeline.html">Lifeline</A> system, whichtoday is the most widely accepted blood bank data management systemavailable. Over 250 systems have been sold worldwide withinstallations in Canada, Saudi Arabia, West Indies, England, Ireland,Kuwait, Guam and the United States.</P><P><A HREF="lsp/lifeline.html">Lifeline</A> has established a solidfoundation in hospitals as a leading blood bank data managementsystem.</P><P>The company recognizes that <B>managed care</B> and <B>managedcompetition</B> have positioned the primary care and specialtyphysician's office as the focal point in the delivery of health careservices. The need for these physicians to have accurate and timelyinformation will be critical in providing cost-effective qualitycare.</P><P>In 1993, in recognition of this need, and to further solidify itsposition in the health care information arena, the company (thencalled Western Star) acquired Informedics, Inc. Around this time,Informedics was contacted by the Oregon Medical Association (OMA) andasked to develop the software and interface for a state-wideinformation network. The Oregon Medical Electronic Network (OMEN)enables medical offices to easily submit electronic claims; checkpatient coverage for eligibility, co-pays, and treatmentauthorizations; refer patients; send electronic mail; check healthplan panels; and access OMA publications.</P><P>The software and interfaces developed for OMEN are being marketedas <A HREF="ids/intramed.html">IntraMed.net</A>, a comprehensiveinformation management network for healthcare professionals,hospitals, laboratories, insurance companies and allied industries.</P><H3><B><I>The Marketplace</I></B></H3><P><HR>By virtue of the addition of new products and related services, themarket for the company's information systems is expanding rapidly. The primary market for the LifeLine system is hospitals and communitydonor centers.  There are more than 5,000 hospitals in the US and 200community blood donor centers.  The market outside the US isestimated to be as large as in this country.</P><P>As managed care and managed competition become increasinglyimportant, medical clinics and sole practitioners will need access topatient eligibility (provided electronically through IntraMed.net),medical records, billing and insurance information.  The company'sIntraMed.net system will allow Informedics to penetrate the vastmarket of managed care in this country and around the world.</P><H3><B><I>Conclusion</I></B></H3><P><HR>With the addition of new laboratory management systems, and theincreased focus on managed care and its networking needs, the companywill address new markets and grow in the broader health careinformation management market. Informedics Inc. expects continuedgrowth from its existing direct and reseller sales efforts as well asoverall increases in revenue and earnings from the IntraMed.netproduct line. The company believes that the managed care approach tohealth care delivery will change the information processing needs ofthe physicians' practice. Management is continuing to seekopportunities in other closely related health care markets that willbenefit from the company's knowledge and experience as it seeks tofurther expand and solidify its market position.</P><P><HR></P><H4>Reprint orders of this information are available on-line.

<h3><a name="PCN3Q">Physician Computer Network, Inc Reports Third Quarter And Nine Months 1997 Results</a></h3>
<p>Morris Plains, N.J. (October 30, 1997) - Physician Computer Network, Inc., (NASDAQ: PCNI) today reported results for the third quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 1997.
<p>Revenues for the third quarter were $26,140,237, a 3% increase over revenues of $25,311,356 in the third quarter of 1996.  Net income for the third quarter was $3,259,747 or $.06 earnings per share, compared with net income of $4,488,312 or $.08 earnings per share in the third quarter of 1996.
<p>For the first nine months of 1997, revenues were $76,042,479, an 11% increase over revenues of $68,206,564 for the comparable 1996 period.  Net income for the first nine months was $10,804,101 or $.20 earnings per share, compared with net income of $11,470,878 or $.22 earnings per share in the first nine months of 1996.
<p>Hank Green, President and CEO of PCN stated, "During the third quarter we experienced high acceptance levels for our new Health Network Version 1.4 product, which was made available in August.  In fact, September was the largest sales month for our Direct channel since we introduced the Health Network product over two years ago."
<p>"Although sales of the clinical product of our HealthPoint joint venture continued at a pace equal to or better than competition, the sales were less than we had expected.  Physician interest in this technology continues to be extremely high and we are working with the HealthPoint team to provide further enhancements to broaden physician specialty knowledge and to increase functionality.  At the same time, we are making significant investments in our PCN infrastructure today so we can install and train large volumes of HealthPoint advanced clinical systems in the future as our increasing sales opportunities materialize.  Through September 30, we have spent approximately $4 million more in 1997 for this purpose, or approximately $.05 per share, than we spent during the same period in 1996.  We continue to be confident that the Health Network and HealthPoint product offerings will continue to be an important component of PCN's future and those expenditures which decrease short-term results are justified."

Net income for the 1996 fourth quarter was $4,585,368, or $0.08 per share, as compared to a loss of $16,468,881 or ($0.39) per share in the fourth quarter of 1995 which included special one-time accounting charges of $19,915,000.
<p>For the full year 1996, revenues rose 129% to $95,797,492 from $41,805,342 for the full year 1995.  Net income for the 1996 full year was $16,056,246, or $0.30 per share, as compared to a loss of $11,680,187 or ($0.29) per share for the full year 1995.

<p>"We are very proud of our achievements in 1996," commented Hank Green, President and Chief Executive Officer of PCN.  "Four quarters of outstanding growth in both revenues and earnings, continued focus on our acquisition strategy with the completion of two additional acquisitions in 1996 and, of course, our partnership with Glaxo Wellcome Inc. early in 1996 which formed the HealthPoint joint venture to provide clinical information technology solutions, were just some of the highlights of our successful year."  Mr. Green added, "In the fourth quarter of 1996, we continued to show strength in system sales through new business and migrations to our PCN Health Network™ Information System, as well as in system upgrades and recurring revenues.  In addition, revenue was favorably impacted by the general release in December of HealthPoint ACS™, the first clinical product offering from HealthPoint.  Revenue growth, coupled with our continuing focus on cost and expense containment, resulted in our excellent financial profile."

All of the acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases.  Mr. Green further added, "Due to the purchase accounting nature of our acquisitions, which have been primarily funded through equity offerings in the public markets, our operating results reflect significant non-cash expenses for amortization of acquired intangible assets amounting to approximately $7.2 million in 1996 compared with $2.9 million in 1995."

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>DAOU Systems Announces Financial Results for Second Quarter
ended</FONT></B> <B><FONT SIZE=+1>June 30, 1997</FONT></B>
<UL>SAN DIEGO, July 16, 1997 -- DAOU Systems (NASDAQ:DAOU) Wednesday reported
record second-quarter revenue accompanied by increases in net income and
earnings per share.

<P>The company posted second-quarter and year-to-date revenue of $6 million
and $11.2 million respectively, increases over the previous year of 15
percent and 49 percent respectively. Net income for the second quarter
was $58,000 with a net loss for the year to date of $174,000.

<P>That translates to second-quarter earnings per share of 1 cent, the
same as for the second quarter of the previous year. The year-to-date earnings
per share are a loss of 2 cents, which compares with a loss of 1 cent for
the same period in 1996.

<P>The increase in revenue is primarily attributable to an increase in
the number of network management and implementation contracts that the
company has secured with such major health care organizations as Harris
Methodist Health System, Centura Health and St. Mary's Health Network.

<P>These and other management contracts have boosted the company's recurring
revenue to 33 percent for the year to date. The company's net income continues
to be impacted by increased expenses associated with the regionalization
of the company's sales organization, the addition of sales personnel and
the expansion of marketing programs. The company reported total sales and
marketing expenses for the second quarter of $1.1 million, an increase
of 186 percent over the $376,000 reported for the same period in 1996.

<P>"We are continuing to roll out our corporate strategy,'' said Georges
Daou, chief executive officer of DAOU Systems. "All our planned regional
offices have been established within the past 120 days and are productive.

<P>"In addition, we have established key alliances like the recently announced
marketing agreement with VHA, a major health care purchasing group. Such
alliances will help provide our company with entry and exposure to new
and larger markets. In the case of VHA, DAOU will be the vendor of choice
for more than 1,500 of VHA's community health care members.

<P>"The solidification of our sales and marketing foundation also allows
the company to offer a broader line of services that include our new desktop
support, which is now being provided to Harris Methodist Health System.''

<P>DAOU Systems also reported that its full network outsourcing contract
with Candler Hospital will not continue past 1997 due to a recent acquisition
of Candler Hospital by St. Joseph's hospital. The company expects positive
results from this event.

<P>There will be no reduction in expected revenue for 1997, and the $600,000
contract-cancellation penalty will augment DAOU's net income for the year.
The event also frees the company to focus on opportunities in desktop support
services which generally yield higher margins and are a good match with
DAOU's core competencies.

<P>The desktop support contract with Harris Methodist Health System is
representative of such opportunities and is expected to replace revenue
lost from the cancellation of the Candler Hospital contract.

<P>Founded in 1987, DAOU Systems designs, implements and manages computer
networks and desktop operations for the health care industry. The company
also offers outsourcing, Internet and network monitoring solutions. DAOU
has provided network services to more than 450 hospitals and health care
facilities nationwide.

<P>With headquarters in San Diego, the company has five regional offices
and more than 230 employees. DAOU's clients include such organizations
as Centura Health, Lutheran Health Systems, Mercy Health Services, Harris
Methodist Health System and Catholic Medical Center of Brooklyn and Queens.

<P>Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters
discussed in this news release are forward-looking statements that involve
numerous risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results could differ
materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements and
will depend upon a number of factors, including those discussed in the
company's filings with the Securities Exchange Commission and other news
releases of the company.</UL>

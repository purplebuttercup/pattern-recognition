Menu-driven and able to run under Microsoft Windows, ithas many advanced monitoring features including directed andautologous tracking; alerts for discrepant test results, quarantinedunits, deferred donors, patient antibodies, and special needs; andextensive user-defined issue controls.</P><P>In addition to automatically comparing entered data against knowntruth tables, <B>LifeLine</B> uses a smart bar code system to "read"the labels on units, and accurately enter the information into yoursystem. Clerical and transcription errors are virtually eliminated.</P><P><B>LifeLine</B> can also produce unit compatibility tags whichinclude information about type of blood product, unit number, ABO/Rhfactor, expiration date, the address of your facility, and crossmatchcompatibility.</P><H3>Provides Flexibility to Satisfy Your Most Challenging Needs</H3><P>For over ten years, <B>LifeLine</B> has set the standard forcontrolling and monitoring all phases of blood bank activities fromdonor recruitment, to donation and blood product receipt, testing,transfusion, and utilization review. Designed specifically for bloodbanks, it can easily be tailored to meet your institutionâs uniquerequirements.</P><P>Because <B>LifeLine</B> computerizes activities normally performedby hand, you can quickly access up-to-the-minute information aboutpatients, donors, and blood inventories without referring tocumbersome handwritten records. In addition, detailed informationsuch as patientsâ and donorsâ histories, special needs, bloodproducts characteristics, collection dates, reagent and devicequality control (QC), and validation records are accurately captured,recorded and stored on-line for immediate retrieval and review.</P><H3>Strengthens Reporting Capabilities</H3><P>The <B>LifeLine</B> system includes a library of report templatesspecifically designed for use in blood banks. Also available isStarWriter, an industry standard report-writing program which enablesyou to produce reports which are tailored to your facilityâs uniqueneeds. With these tools, you can quickly produce transfusionsummaries, inventory statuses, daily activity reports, comprehensiveworkload reports, utilization reviews, and other useful documents.</P><H3>Integrates with</H3><P>Your existing system using an HL7 industry standard network link,<B>LifeLine</B> integrates with all major Laboratory InformationSystems.

Donor and unitinformation is always available for routine or emergency review anduse. Should a component failure occur, its fault-toleranceconfiguration minimizes downtime and makes it possible to quicklypinpoint and repair the problem.</P><H3>You May Know us as Western Star</H3><P>Since 1984, Western Star has been installing the <B>LifeLine</B>Blood Bank Data Management System system in blood banks throughoutthe world. Since then, numerous features have been added, and changesmade to the original product. Most recently, the Western Star namewas changed to Informedics.</P><P>While our name has changed, the safety, quality, and acceptabilityof our <B>LifeLine</B> systems has remained the same. Used in bloodbanks throughout the world, <B>LifeLine</B> helps assure thatrequired tests are performed, necessary safeguards are met, and donorand patient records are kept confidential.

<h2><a name="System Overview"></a>System Overview</h2>

<p>LEO-T was designed to solve the problem of the high cost of
ground station services. It is a complete, essentially unmanned,
ground station for low Earth orbiters. Its key attributes are
autonomy and remote operational control.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Autonomy</h4>

<p>LEO-T functions in a fully autonomous environment. The system
is driven by an internal schedule containing spacecraft AOS and
LOS times and maintenance events. LEO-T automatically obtains the
latest orbital element sets, issues store and forward commands,
configures ground equipment, tracks the spacecraft, and even
delivers telemetry data to the PI, post pass.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Remote Operations</h4>

<p>PI' s may log in remotely at any time to schedule new events
or monitor or control the current activity of their spacecraft.
All system capabilities are available remotely to the ground
station administer (GSA) and appropriate PI on the internet using
a standard X-session. Using the Administrative User Interface (<a
href="screen.htm#aui">AUI</a>) and the <a href="../isiepoch.htm">EPOCH-2000</a>
viewer (included), the GSA may start and stop operations, perform
tests, or monitor the ground equipment at a LEO-T. The GSA and PI
may also use the AUI to schedule events and uplink real-time
commands. During a pass, LEO-T automatically establishes a TCP/IP
connection to the PI and transmits telemetry and station log
data. A <a href="screen.htm#java">sample TCP/IP application</a>
(written in JAVA) is provided with the system to view this data,
but the PI may process the data from this connection in any way.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>High Performance</h4>

<p>LEO-T's main channel telemetry path is capable of a throughput
of 15 Mbps. This is 3 times the basic TDM throughput rate and 1.5
times the CCSDS rate, using Rate 1/2 convolutional encoding. This
design can support future expansion via a simple substitution of
a small number of components to 25 Mbps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Flexibility</h4>

<p>A single LEO-T can simultaneously support more than 20
different satellites with orbits in the 175 Km to 1000 km range.
Ground equipment is automatically reconfigured for the next
spacecraft between passes using canned equipment setups created
by the PI' s. The system is capable of processing CCSDS version 1
and 2 as well as TDM telemetry data.</p>

<p>Users can access the AUI and EPOCH-2000 viewer from any
X-session. Any system supporting the TCP/IP protocol can function
as the client for FTP uploads and downloads and the telemetry/log
monitoring connection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Security</h4>

<p>The system ensures that the GSA alone is permitted to perform
station administrative tasks. The PI and GSA share the authority
to control specific mission-related tasks such as pass scheduling
and equipment configuration.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Cost Efficiency</h4>

<p>The absence of an operations crew results in a significant
reduction in operating costs. Also, because LEO-T is capable of
supporting multiple missions, station time can be shared and
costs distributed among the member missions.</p>

<h2><a name="Architecture"></a>Architecture</h2>

<p>LEO-T is based on the proven <a href="../isiepoch.htm">EPOCH-2000</a>
architecture; A distributed processing environment in which all
ground station activities (telemetry processing, commanding,
etc.) are performed by a real-time machine, while all
administrative duties and M&amp;C are offloaded to a separate
PC-based workstation. The two are connected via fast ethernet.
Since the system is on the internet and the user interface is an
X-Windows client, the user need not be present at the actual
LEO-T workstation to control the system. An authorized user can
access the LEO-T from any location in the world.</p>

<h2><a name="Open Standards"></a>Open Standards</h2>

<p><b>LEO-T </b>supports all the current industry standards for
open architectures: </p>

<p>Support for the VME (Versi-Modular European) bus allows <b>LEO-T</b>
to interface with a wide variety of bit sync, frame sync,
decommutator, EU (Engineering Units) converter, and command
encoder cards. <a href="screen.htm#rack">Click here to see the
LEO-T hardware rack.</a></p>

<hr>

<h2>Database Driven</h2>

<p>As with EPOCH-2000, all of the LEO-T software is database
driven, allowing it to support different hardware configurations
by merely modifying the database. This flexibility permits system
upgrades and changes without incurring the cost of software
modifications.</p>

<p>The RDBMS is used for offline data management only. During
run-time the data definitions are obtained from flat files
exported from the database and shipped to each processing node
over the network. The flat files are read into memory on
initialization for run-time access on each workstation. This
approach ensures the best run-time performance (there are no
delays from querying the database) while simultaneously providing
all the traceability and accountability features of an RDBMS. </p>

<hr>

<h2>User Interface</h2>

<p>LEO-T features an X-Windows/ Motif-compliant GUI (Graphical
User Interface) which provides for easy, intuitive interaction
with the system. Use of the X-Windows standard allows a user to
access the GUI from any remote machine running an X-session. <a
href="screen.htm">Click here to see examples of the user
interface</a></p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="Telemetry"></a>Telemetry Processing</h2>

<p>The telemetry subsystem is capable of a throughput of 15 Mbps,
expandible to 25 Mbps. CCSDS versions 1 and 2 are supported,
along with TDM formats. Dual receivers and bit syncs along with
diversity combiner are provided for improved single downlink
quality, or for processing two downlinks simultaneously.
Telemetry data is stored on the LEO-T front-end processor and
shipped, or <em>pushed</em>, post-pass, to a destination selected
by the PI. This data is also available real-time on a TCP/IP for
decommutation and monitoring.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="Command"></a>Commanding</h2>

<p>The command subsystem supports store-and-forward and real-time
spacecraft commanding with COP-1 verification. PI's can issue and
abort store-and forward command sets and real-time commands
remotely via the LEO-T administrative user interface (AUI).</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="Orbit"></a>Orbit Determination</h2>

<p>The included OASYS software module provides satellite
ephemeris propagation and computes a list of candidate passes to
be selected for scheduling for all supported spacecraft. Click

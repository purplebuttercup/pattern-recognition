<p>
Most large organizations already recognize the competitive advantage to be gained by investing in information systems. The need for consulting service providers
has never been greater, but the number of those which have mastered the application of new and evolving computing technologies is few and far between. And among the few consulting companies which do boast those credentials, none offer a wealth of deep technical experience gained through having helped develop and test those technologies.
<p> None except PSW Technologies.
<p>
PSW Technologies is a new breed of consulting and software service provider whose customers include many of the Fortune 500's providers and business end-users of leading edge computing technologies.
<p>
As an innovator among the wave of new software services companies, we achieve a
one- to two-year lead on the application of new technologies. We accomplish this through close development partnerships with companies like Tivoli Systems, System Soft, Lotus Development and IBM, where we are helping some of the world's most prominent technology providers bring high-quality products to market faster.
<p>
We then apply this expertise to develop enterprise systems for business end-users, who seek to build distributed and object-oriented systems based on heterogeneous <a href="nt.html"> Windows NT </a> and UNIX platforms. This real world experience in turn allows us to better-serve our technology vendor clients, who benefit from the first-hand experience gained through applying their technologies.
<p>
Our flexible business models and the development methodologies we employ to help manage risk and keep clients' costs low, are several of the things which make PSW Technologies unique. Our constant goal is to prepare clients to support, enhance and maintain their own software systems, which we accomplish through onsite project management of joint development teams, as well as mentoring and training.
<p>
Our successful approach is based on the high-quality individuals who form PSW Technologies. From our engineers to our <a href="org2.html"> executive management team</a>, 
we are committed to customer delight, not just satisfaction. PSW Technologies is <a href="maptopsw.html"> headquartered </a> in <a href="http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/"> Austin, Texas</a>, and has regional offices in the Seattle and New York areas. Our facilities feature sophisticated and secure software development and testing labs and are networked to support local and remote projects, as well as projects that span multiple locations.

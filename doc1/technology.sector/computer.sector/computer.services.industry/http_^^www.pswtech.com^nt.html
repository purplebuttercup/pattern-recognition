When Windows NT was just beginning to emerge as a viable business platform several years ago, PSW Technologies targeted it as a strategic technology that would complement our platform expertise in UNIX. 
<p>
We established a relationship with IBM Corporation, which eventually led to PSW running the entire testing organization within the IBM Kirkland Programming Center (in Kirkland, Washington).  This organization, comprised of about 100 PSW Technologies software engineers, also works with IBM and Microsoft Corporation to port, test, and support Windows NT on the IBM Power PC, RS/6000, and IBM Intel PC machines. This work provides PSW with early technical knowledge of NT including device support, configuration management, performance, NT kernel functionality, Windows User Interface, and Microsoft BackOffice functionality. 
<p>
Having worked with these new product features before any other software service 
company, PSW Technologies offers clients two critical advantages: 
<ul>
<li> Deep expertise in all aspects of the Windows NT platform
<li> Ability to roll out new products and information systems more quickly because the learning curve is virtually non-existent for development and porting 
</ul>
<p>
<h3>NEW NT PORTING CENTER IN BELLEVUE, WASHINGTON</h3>
Microsoft's Windows NT has grown to become the business operating system of choice. 
In fact , according to IDC Research, 30 percent of businesses today say they are moving to NT. The reality, however, is that despite NT's wide-scale acceptance, many applications and products today still cannot run on NT. In response to this shortage of NT-compatible applications and products, PSW Technologies opened a development and testing center in Bellevue, Washington.  At the NT porting center, PSW concentrates sales and engineering efforts on training NT developers and porting products to the Microsoft platform. 
<p>
<h3>TRAINING & CERTIFICATION</h3>
Software development organizations are scrambling to tailor their products for NT, while business end-users struggle to optimize their internal NT systems.  These enterprises requirements for proficient NT developers far exceeds the availablility of such resources.  Through its rigorous training program, PSW's porting center is building a pool of highly qualified, professionally certified NT developers.  Engineers at the porting center are required to participate  in Microsoft's certification training, which consists of 20-plus courses.  PSW Technologies teaches more than half of these.  
<h3>APPLYING NT SKILLS</h3>
Through ongoing work with Microsoft's Developer Relations Group, we stay current on planned NT features and enhancements and have  been included in various design review discussions. In addition, the Microsoft DRG often refers to PSW Technologies their ISVs seeking technical advice on complex engineering issues such as porting from UNIX to NT. 
<p>
PSW's credentials in the Windows NT arena have already brought them business from companies like SystemSoft, makers of the PC card support software for laptops, and Excalibur Technologies, a provider of pattern recognition software for information retrieval. In addition, many existing end-user and vendor clients are leveraging PSW's deep pool of technical talent to create new NT-based systems and commercial products.

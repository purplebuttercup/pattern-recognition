			<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#DD0000"><B>Network Architecture<BR>
			</B></FONT>To overcome the performance limitations of the Internet, @Home Network
			has developed a high-performance &quot;parallel Internet.&quot; While it uses the
			same underlying protocols to ensure compatibility and seamless access to everything
			on the Internet, @Home's network architecture is markedly different.</P>
			<P><IMG SRC="images/network.gif" WIDTH="360" HEIGHT="248" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
			<P>Two key themes in @Home's network strategy are &quot;pushing data closer&quot;
			and &quot;end-to-end management.&quot; To embody the first theme, @Home Network uses
			a hierarchical, distributed network architecture with proprietary caching and replication
			technologies to ensure that information a user wants is always &quot;as close as
			possible&quot; within the network. &quot;End-to-end management&quot; describes @Home's
			proactive network quality, service and performance management systems. Because the
			network is centrally managed, @Home can avoid the &quot;finger pointing&quot; that
			plagues the general Internet, and instead dynamically identify and address network
			quality, service and performance issues before they ever affect users.</P>
			<P>The primary components of @Home's network infrastructure include the ATM backbone,
			Regional Data Centers (RDCs), Local Caching Servers, Cable Modems and the Network
			Operations Center.</P>
			<P><B>ATM Backbone</B><BR>
			@Home Network operates its own national infrastructure, which connects to the global
			Internet at multiple Network Access Points (NAPs). The network also has Tier-One
			peering with other national and regional Internet Service Providers. A high-speed
			Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) fiber optic backbone connects these access and peering
			interchange points to @Home Network's RDCs. @Home Network's ATM backbone provides
			a high performance, cost-effective, scaleable transport mechanism, as well as the
			capability to extend service to new markets without having to constantly reconfigure
			the network as it expands. The backbone operates at OC-3 (155Mbps) speeds and can
			be upgraded to higher speeds.</P>
			<P><B>Regional Data Centers (RDCs)</B><BR>
			@Home Network's RDCs act as service hubs for defined geographic areas, such as major
			metropolitan areas. Key activities at the RDCs include:

			</BLOCKQUOTE>

			<UL>
				<UL>
					<LI>Delivering @Home Network's online multimedia content and services (including
					World Wide Web, email, newsgroups and chat) to subscribers
					<LI>Monitoring and proactively managing network performance
					<LI>Multicasting multimedia content and other data streams efficiently throughout
					the region
					<LI>Replicating and caching media partners' content and applications
					<LI>Providing infrastructure to economically house cable operators' local content
					and subscribers' web pages
				</UL>
			</UL>


			<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P><B>Local Caching Servers</B><BR>
			At the next level of the distributed network, local neighborhood points of presence,
			called headends, are connected to each RDC. Consistent with the goal of pushing data
			as close to the customer as possible, these headends deploy enhanced proxy servers
			for caching content. Benefits of using local caching servers to keep data close to
			the user, include:

			</BLOCKQUOTE>

			<UL>
				<UL>
					<LI>Major performance improvements since the cache acts as a &quot;dedicated&quot;
					local server, even for data that originated in the broader Internet
					<LI>Reduction in the amount of data movement in higher layers of the network
					<LI>Far more comprehensive usage statistics than normally attainable on the Internet;
					these statistics can be used for tuning performance, tailoring the service, and targeting
					promotions and advertising
				</UL>
			</UL>


			<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P><B>Cable Modems</B><BR>
			In the home, a cable modem connects to the cable television coaxial wiring and also
			attaches to the user's Windows or Macintosh computer via a standard Ethernet connection.
			In the near future, &quot;Internet appliances&quot; and similar devices may provide
			access. Cable modems are sold by several vendors, including Motorola, Hewlett-Packard,
			Bay Networks and a number of smaller manufacturers. The speed of the modem depends
			on the specific model, but generally varies between 10 Mbps and 30 Mbps downstream
			to the home, and between 768 Kbps and 10 Mbps upstream from the home.</P>
			<P><B>Network Operations Center (NOC)</B><BR>
			@Home Network provides end-to-end network management through the NOC. Acting as &quot;mission
			control,&quot; the NOC uses proprietary network management tools and systems to monitor
			the network 24-hours-per-day, seven-days-a-week; identify and resolve potential issues
			before they affect the network; and manage performance along the entire path from
			the content provider to the home computer. From the centralized NOC, @Home can manage
			multiple RDC locations, local caching servers, and other network infrastructure.
			@Home's carefully designed, consistent system configuration and management also enable
			the NOC to provide a high level of overall system security and reliability.</P>
			<P><B>Multiple Delivery Systems</B><BR>
			While two-way HFC continues to provide the best medium for broadband service, @Home
			Network provides multiple solutions to reach customers not serviced by two-way delivery
			systems. Telco-return systems deliver data via high-speed cable lines while upstream
			data travel over conventional phone lines. As the vast majority of traffic is downstream,
			the performance for telco-return users is more than 100 times faster than conventional
			dial-up services while the information they send, such as key strokes and mouse clicks,
			travel at analog speeds. In addition, telco-return provides a smooth migration path
			to a two-way delivery system for cable operators.</P>

			<P>@Home's MDU solution enables cable operators to extend the @Home service to large
			residential complexes without the added expense of providing cable modems for each
			apartment or unit. Similar in design to a business LAN, information from the @Home
			Network flows through a regional data center (RDC) to a housing complex via a two-way
			digital line at T1 speeds or higher depending upon traffic loads. Information is
			then disseminated through a central high-speed router stored at the complex. From
			the router information is carried to secure Ethernet 10Base-T hubs in each building.
			The hubs are connected to single apartments or units by Ethernet wiring and within
			in each apartment or unit, data ports are installed in convenient locations, such
			as the den/living room or bedroom, for easy personal computer hook-ups.

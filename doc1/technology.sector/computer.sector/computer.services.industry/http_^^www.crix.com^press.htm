<h2>Computer Research, Inc.
(OTC Bulletin Board: <a href="http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=CRIX&d=t">CRIX</a>
- Reports Financial Results for 1997</h2>
Computer Research today reported net income of $916,670 or $0.23 per
share on revenues of $7,767,586 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 1997,
compared to net income of $1,028,477 or $0.26 per share on revenues of
$7,385,358 for the previous year.

<p>
Computer Research provides computerized accounting and record-keeping
support services to securities broker/dealers, banks and other financial
institutions throughout the U.S.  Its revenues are affected by trading volume
reflected in the number of stock and bond trading transactions it processes
for clients.

<p>
Company President James L. Schultz said the 5-percent increase in revenues
for the past fiscal year was due primarily to additional service revenues.
While pre-tax income for 1997 was approximately $80,000 above the previous
year, net income fell slightly because the company is now in a fully taxed
situation.

<p>
Mr. Schultz also reported that a two-year project to convert the company's
software product line to operate on IBM AS/400 computer equipment was
completed during the fourth quarter of the 1997 fiscal year.  The conversion
was accomplished under a joint agreement with Wachovia Operational Services
Corporation, an affiliate of a major client of Computer Research.  For its
participation in the conversion project, Wachovia Operational Services
Corporation obtained an operating license for the software, which it will
utilize to provide services to its affiliate on an ``in-house'' basis beginning
in the second quarter of fiscal year 1998.

<p>
Mr. Schultz said converting the software to run on the widely used IBM
platform, which included making it year-2000 compatible, will enable the
company to license its leading-edge accounting software to others for
``in-house'' utilization.

<p>
``While the software conversion was in progress, our new business
development efforts were hampered somewhat during the past year,'' he said.
``Now that the software is operational on the IBM AS/400, and we have an
installed software license user to showcase its effectiveness, we are very
well positioned to explore new sales opportunities with banks and brokerage
firms that prefer to run their own in-house data centers.''

<p>
Mr. Schultz said that while revenues are expected to decline in fiscal
1998 due to the loss of the major client, the decrease should be offset
beginning in fiscal year 1999 by the company's new ability to generate license
revenues and by continued growth in service revenues from current clients, as
well as from potential new clients who are currently considering Computer
Research products and services.

<p>
Computer Research will continue to offer its products on a service bureau
basis for clients that choose to outsource their record-keeping requirements.

<P>For the first nine months of the current fiscal year, the Company reported net income of $606,747 or $.15 per share on revenues of $5,827,375 compared to net income of $809,807 or $.20 per share on revenues of $5,604,405 for the first nine months of 1996.</P>

<P>President James L. Schultz said the increase in revenues for the third quarter and for the first nine months resulted from additional service revenues.

<h2>Computer Research, Inc. Reports Results for Second Quarter and First Half</h2>
<!-- TextStart -->
<BR>

<p>
    PITTSBURGH, April 9 --  <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/news/crix.html">Computer Research Inc</a>  today reported slightly lower results for the

second quarter and first half of the fiscal year which ended February 28,

1997.

<p>
    Second-quarter net income was $241,034 or $0.06 per share on revenues of

$2,074,461 compared to net income of $332,779 or $0.08 per share on revenues

of $1,972,331 for second quarter of the previous fiscal year.  For the first

six months of the current fiscal year, the company reported net income of

$389,024 or $0.10 per share on revenues of $3,880,608 compared to net income

of $610,865 or $0.15 per share on revenues of $3,758,019, for the first half

of fiscal year 1996.

<p>
    President James L. Schultz said an increased allocation for income taxes

for the current year contributed to the decrease in net income.  The company

is now on a fully taxed basis as opposed to the previous year when a net

operating loss carry forward reduced the amount of taxes payable.  In

addition, he said, income was impacted by increased payroll and other costs

associated with a major project to modify the company's software to handle

processing for the year 2000.

<p>
    Computer Research provides computerized accounting and record-keeping

support services to over 60 securities broker/dealers, banks and other

investment firms throughout the U.S. Its revenues are directly affected by

<h2><STRONG>COMPUTER RESEARCH, INC. REPORTS RECORD-HIGH PROFIT FOR 1996</STRONG></h2>

PITTSBURGH, November 25 -- Computer Research, Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: CRIX) today reported record-high net income of $1,028,477 or $0.26 per share on revenues of $7,461,733 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 1996, compared to net income of $398,139, or $0.10 per share on revenues of $6,204,147 for the previous year.
<BR><BR>
Computer Research provides computerized accounting and support services to securities broker/dealers, banks and other investment firms throughout the U.S.  Its revenues are affected by trading volume reflected in the number of stock and bond trading transactions it processes for clients.
<BR><BR>
Company President James. L. Schultz said revenues for the past fiscal year increased approximately 20 percent over the previous year, due primarily to an increase of about 25 percent in the number of transactions processed for clients.  He also noted that revenues increased during the past year from both market segments served by the Company -- stock and bond brokerage clients and banking institutions.
<BR><BR>
"Fiscal year 1996 was most gratifying," Mr. Schultz said.  "In addition to achieving the highest net income in our history, we also made significant progress on converting our software to become operational on state-of-the-art computer equipment, a major step that will position our Company for accelerated growth in the future."
<BR><BR>
As previously reported, Computer Research is in the process of converting its entire software product line to operate on the IBM AS/400, a switch from the Honeywell Bull mainframe computer system it now uses.  The conversion project is expected to be completed in mid-1997, yielding several important benefits including significant savings in maintenance costs.
<BR><BR>
Also, with its software operational on the widely utilized IBM platform, the Company will be able to offer its data-processing products on an "in-house" basis to clients who prefer to run the software on their own computer systems.  This will open new opportunities for Computer Research to expand its market beyond the 60-plus clients it now serves on a service-bureau basis from Data Centers in Pittsburgh and Denver.
<BR><BR>
Mr. Schultz also announced that as part of the software conversion project, Computer Research is addressing the much-publicized problem that many computer software systems may face moving into calendar year 2000.
<BR><BR>
"We have attacked this situation early in modifying our software," Mr. Schultz said.  "When our software conversion project is completed by mid-1997, our programs will fully support the change to calendar year 2000."
<BR><BR>
The past year's financial results enabled Computer Research to substantially increase its liquidity and it closed the fiscal year with cash reserves in excess of $2 million.
<BR><BR>
"These reserves are now available to support continues sales efforts and or the development and acquisition of products that will be beneficial to our business," Mr. Schultz said.  "As we begin fiscal year 1997 we are in the process of adding new brokerage clients and are having positive discussions with a number of banking institutions.  We believe that our market research efforts and new product development work by our systems staff over the past few years are now beginning to pay dividends."

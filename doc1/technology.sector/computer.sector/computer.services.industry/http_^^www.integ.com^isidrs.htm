<h2><a name="Remote Environmental Monitoring">Remote
Environmental Monitoring</a></h2>

<p>Integral Systems provides a family of products and services to
facilitate the collection, storage, and analysis of environmental
data. Our <strong>DOMSAT Receive Station (DRS)</strong> is a
mature product with over 50 installations in the United States
and Canada enabling government and private organizations to
receive environmental data from literally thousands of remote
stations located throughout the western hemisphere. We have
recently expanded our offerings with the addition of
decoding/translation software, real-time database interfaces, and
the integration of complete data analysis and response systems
using off-the-shelf networking and application products. </p>

<p>Environmental monitoring is becoming increasingly important in
today's world. There are many diverse applications that require
real-time acquisition of environmental data. These include: </p>

<h2><a name="Data Collection via Satellite">Data Collection via
Satellite</a></h2>

<p>The <strong>Domestic Satellite Receive Station (DRS)</strong>
is a proven product which provides many federal, state, local,
and private organizations with the ability to collect remote
environmental data in real-time. The <strong>DRS</strong> forms
the final segment of the GOES Data Collection System or <a
href="dcs.htm">DCS</a>. </p>

<p>The DCS is government-funded and provides for the collection
and distribution of data from up to 100,000 remote Data
Collection Platforms (DCPs). Currently there are approximately
7,500 DCPs throughout the western hemisphere. Each one typically
contains several sensors monitoring various aspects of the
environment. </p>

<p>The hub of this network is the DCS Automated Processing System
or 'DAPS', which resides in Wallops, VA. Built and installed by
Integral Systems, the DAPS became operational in September 1989
and now serves the DCS user community. </p>

<p>To use the DCS, an organization will typically purchase and
maintain several platforms. The government assigns frequencies
and times for message transmission. The <strong>DOMSAT Receive
Station</strong> then provides a low-cost method of receiving
data from any or all platforms in the DCS. Among its features
are: </p>

<h2><a name="Environmental Message Interpreter Translator">Environmental
Message Interpreter Translator</a> (<a name="EMIT">EMIT</a>) </h2>

<p>Environmental information can be collected from many different
types of remote devices. These include satellite-based DCPs,
electronic data loggers, line-of-sight radio and microwave links,
and manual data collection. There are many manufacturers of such
devices, and even identical devices can be configured in
different ways depending on the sensors installed and the method
of data collection. Consequently, any software that receives and
processes this data must be capable of handling a multitude of
different formats. </p>

<p>The <strong>Environmental Message Interpreter Translator
(EMIT)</strong> simplifies the process of data collection by
translating incoming data into a unified stream of time-tagged
samples. <strong>EMIT</strong> is a PC-based software package
which can run on the <strong>DOMSAT Receive Station</strong> (or
other UNIX system) to provide: </p>

<dl>
    <dd><img src="gifs/dot_gree.gif" width="20" height="20">Real-time
        data decoding </dd>
    <dd><img src="gifs/dot_gree.gif" width="20" height="20">Units
        conversion </dd>
    <dd><img src="gifs/dot_gree.gif" width="20" height="20">Calculation
        of derived parameters </dd>
    <dd><img src="gifs/dot_gree.gif" width="20" height="20">Translation
        into standard formats </dd>
    <dd><img src="gifs/dot_gree.gif" width="20" height="20">Database
        ingest </dd>
</dl>

<p>Easy-to-use menus enable you to maintain a database of
decoding and processing information. This information tells <strong>EMIT</strong>
how to extract time-tagged samples from the incoming raw
messages, as well as how to perform unit conversions, derive new
parameters, and where to send the resulting data stream. </p>

<p><strong>EMIT</strong> contains an Equation Processor with a
flexible mathematical language allowing you to compute derived
parameters from the raw values reported by your sensors. For
example, you can convert stream-stage to flow, compute water
salinity as a function of temperature and conductance, compute
periodic averages, rates of change, etc. You can also extend the
equation language by adding your own C-language functions. </p>

<h2><a name="Database Interfaces">Database Interfaces</a></h2>

<p>After environmental data is collected and converted to
engineering units, it will most likely be stored in a time-series
database. <strong>EMIT</strong> is available with the following
output interfaces: </p>

<dl>
    <dd><img src="gifs/dot_gree.gif" width="20" height="20">ORACLE
        Relational Database </dd>
    <dd><img src="gifs/dot_gree.gif" width="20" height="20">SHEF
        (Standard Hydrometeorologic Exchange Format) </dd>
    <dd><img src="gifs/dot_gree.gif" width="20" height="20">HEC-DSS
        (Corps of Engineers Hydrologic Engineering Center Data
        Storage System) </dd>
    <dd><img src="gifs/dot_gree.gif" width="20" height="20">ASCII
        Time-Tagged Sample List </dd>
</dl>

<p>The ORACLE Output Module converts the time-tagged data into a
series of SQL (Structured Query Language) statements, which are
then executed across a network. The result is that incoming data
is placed in the database in real-time and is immediately
available for processing, display, or graphical analysis. </p>

<p>There are many advantages to storing environmental data in an
ORACLE database: </p>

<dl>
    <dd><img src="gifs/dot_gree.gif" width="20" height="20">ORACLE
        runs on practically any machine, giving you freedom to
        mix hardware and OS software from different vendors. </dd>
    <dd><img src="gifs/dot_gree.gif" width="20" height="20">A
        wealth of third-party software with interfaces to ORACLE
        is available for statistical analysis, graphics,
        data-form/tabular displays, GIS, etc. </dd>
    <dd><img src="gifs/dot_gree.gif" width="20" height="20">Working
        over a LAN, the server machine handles the extraction of
        just the data desired for a given analysis program, thus
        reducing the processing and storage requirements on other
        workstations. </dd>
</dl>

<p>SHEF is a National Weather Service standard used for the
transmission and storage of hydrologic and meteorologic data.
Many databases currently in use for these applications are
capable of ingesting data in SHEF. Such systems can directly
interface with <strong>EMIT</strong>. </p>

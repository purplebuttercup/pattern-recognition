  Computer Research, Inc. (CRI) has been an active and innovative  

part of the financial services industry since 1963, serving hundreds  

of clients with our various accounting systems.  We have developed  

long term client relationships based on a combination of technical  

know-how, quality service and competitive pricing.  Since 1982, we  

have annually serviced over 100 financial service clients  

nationwide.

  CRI understands that today's financial industry is constantly  

reshaping through mergers, acquisitions and constant regulatory  

changes.  These changes require bank investment division management  

to re-evaluate their current security processing systems in an  

effort to maintain continuity in operations, support a complex and  

diverse investment product line and to reduce overall operating  

costs.

  CRI has kept pace with this rapidly changing environment with its  

family of investment software applications.  These applications are  

specifically designed for the banking environment of the 1990's to  

allow the user to enter the twenty-first century as a leader in  

banking security services.

  CRI's BANK-BOA Systems are unique in the data processing industry  

and are readily adaptable to any banking environment.  They can be  

utilized independently of each other or linked together for a fully  

integrated application.  Sensitive to customer needs and extremely  

user friendly, they are quickly and smoothly installed with on-going  

assistance from the CRI support group.

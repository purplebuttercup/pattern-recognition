ECCS, Inc., Tinton Falls, New Jersey, October 15, 1997 -- ECCS Inc. (NASDAQ SmallCap:
ECCS) today reported positive results for the nine months and the third quarter ended
September 30, 1997. Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 1997 were $26.5
million, an increase of $8.4 million or 46% as compared to $18.1 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 1996.<br>
<br>
Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 1997 was $900 thousand or $.12 and $.10
per share on a primary and fully diluted basis respectively. This represents an
improvement of $1.4 million, when compared to the Company's net loss of $530 thousand or
$.16 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 1996.<br>
<br>
Net sales for the third quarter ended September 30, 1997 were $8.7 million, an increase of
$3.5 million or 67% as compared to $5.2 million in the third quarter of 1996. For the
third quarter of 1997, ECCS reported a net income of $202 thousand, or $.02 per share on
both a primary and fully diluted basis, an improvement of $357 thousand as compared to the

<br>
This quarter's results reflect an extraordinary charge of $120 thousand which resulted

<br>
G.M. Azcuy, President and Chief Executive Officer said, &quot;The Company is continuing to
make good and solid progress this year. This is the result of the success of our
innovative products, our new and existing customers, and the efforts of our dedicated
employees. We are continuing to invest in our R&amp;D and Engineering organizations as
reflected by our more than 60% spending increase in this quarter, as compared to the same
quarter last year. We have several new products that are in the final stages of
completion, and I am confident that we have a solid vision for the future of mission
critical and clustered storage in the Windows NT, Unix and Open Systems marketplace. We
have much work ahead of us and we will continue to remain true to our mission of seeking
innovation, growth and profitability in concert.&quot;<br>

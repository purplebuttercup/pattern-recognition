<br>
TINTON FALLS, NJ. ECCS INC, today announced that the Synchronix Storage Management System
has been validated by Microsoft for use on servers running Microsoft Windows NT Server,
Enterprise Edition 4.0.<br>
<br>
Synchronix, a high-performance, highly scalable, continuously available, resilient storage
solution is a full feature RAID (redundant array of independent disks) product family
designed for use in Windows NT and UNIX mission critical environments. The failover
capabilities of the Synchronix will complement the high availability features of Windows
NT Server Enterprise Edition 4.0.<br>
<br>
&quot;Windows NT Server Enterprise Edition 4.0 is designed to deliver high availability
and scalability for enterprise customers' mission critical servers,&quot; said Enzo
Schiano, Group Product Manager for Windows NT Server at Microsoft. &quot;Microsoft is
pleased that ECCS is complementing the new Enterprise Edition of Windows NT Server with
the high availability and performance of its Synchronix storage solution.&quot; <br>
<br>
The Synchronix is also a candidate for inclusion in validated cluster configurations for
Microsoft Cluster Server, the built-in clustering feature of Windows NT Server Enterprise
Edition 4.0.<br>
<br>
The clustering capability of Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition 4.0, which is based on
open specifications and industry-standard hardware, will initially configure clusters of
two servers. Microsoft validation of cluster hardware is done for complete cluster
configurations consisting of two servers and their shared storage. <br>
<br>
Clustered systems provide high availability and greater aggregate performance for critical
business applications. In conjunction with Windows NT Server Enterprise Edition 4.0,
Microsoft has invited leading industry system and storage vendors to develop base system
configurations, which may be used within validated cluster configurations for Microsoft
Cluster Server. <br>
<br>
&quot;ECCS is working closely with several server vendors to include our storage
subsystems within validated cluster configurations for Microsoft Cluster Server,&quot;
said David Boyle, ECCS' Vice President Sales and Marketing. &quot;We are positioned to
drive our clustering knowledge into the Windows NT Server market. As an industry leader in
the open systems storage market, ECCS is providing scalable, high performance and
continuously available storage systems that complement powerful Windows NT based
servers.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;The high availability cluster Windows NT Server market requires performance,
continuous availability, and reliability. Currently, Synchronix is well positioned as one
of the few products for the Windows NT Server marketplace with the necessary I/O
performance and fault tolerance required at the mission critical level,&quot; said Robert
Gray, Research Manager of Storage Systems, International Data Corporation.</p>

Dataram Corporation warrants that its memory will conform to the manufacturer’s specifications for the 
computer in which it is originally installed and will be free from defects in workmanship and materials for the 
lifetime of that computer.
<P>
Your sole and exclusive remedy and Dataram’s sole obligation under this warranty is to correct any failure by 
repair, replacement or adjustment, or at Dataram’s sole option and discretion, to take back the board and 
refund the purchase price.
<P>
This warranty covers only normal customer use of the board.  Dataram shall not be liable under this warranty 
if any damage or defect results from (i) misuse, abuse, neglect, improper shipping or installation, (ii) disasters 
such as fire, flood, lightning or improper electrical current, (iii) service or alteration by anyone other than an 
authorized Dataram representative, or (iv) attachments, features or devices employed on the board which are 
not supplied by Dataram or not approved in writing by Dataram.
<P>
Dataram makes no other warranty, either express or implied, including but not limited to any implied warranties 
of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or conformity to any representation or description, with 
respect to this board other than as set forth above.  Dataram makes no warranty or representation, either express 
or implied, with respect to any other manufacturer’s product or documentation, its quality, performance, 
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or conformity to any representation or description.
<P>
Except as provided above, Dataram is not liable for any loss, cost, expense, inconvenience or damage, including 
direct, indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, that may result from the use 
or inability to use the board. Under no circumstances shall Dataram be liable for any loss, cost expense, 
inconvenience or damage exceeding the purchase price of the board.
<P>
The warranty and remedies set forth above are exclusive and in lieu of all others, oral or written, expressed or implied.  
No Dataram reseller, agent or employee is authorized to make any modification, extension or addition to this warranty.

<p align="left">With today's rapid technology turnover,
information systems professionals must determine how they will
advance to the next platform every few years. With that in mind,
buying and owning the technology has major drawbacks, including:
software needing more speed, more memory, more disk space, higher
resolution video, faster communications. Along with these
technology drawbacks there are depreciation and tax issues which
make leasing the financing option of choice in the micro-computer
industry.</p>
<p align="left">Since we are one of the largest computer
integration companies in the country, we understand the
challenges you face in balancing user needs and corporate
budgets. Our leasing solutions were designed with those
challenges in mind. We provide you with realistic options for
terms, early termination clauses and upgrades so that as your
needs evolve, so can yourr technology assets.</p>
<p align="left">Our newest program was developed to provide you
with even more flexibility regarding IT assets. The program
enables you to &quot;refresh&quot; your technology assets in a
timely and efficient manner by allowing you to designate three
critical dimensions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p align="left">Lease Term (one year, two years or three
        years) </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p align="left">Upgrade Starting Point (anywhere inside
        the term) </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p align="left">Upgrade Percentage (1% to 5%) depending
        on your needs. Lets look at an example: </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p align="left">Lease Term: 3 Years </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p align="left">Upgrade Starting Point: 18 months </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p align="left">Upgrade Percentage: 3% </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">In this example, after 18 months you can begin to
return 3% of your technology assets each month with no penalty.
This means that you could &quot;turnover&quot; more than half of
these assets before the lease term has expired! An earlier
starting point would enable you to refresh an even higher
percentage. You decide! This program is simply an example of the
flexibility that lease financing with Pomeroy Computer Resources
can help stretch your IT budget while providing you with maximum
user benefit.</p>
<p align="left">Pomeroy Computer Resources has originated more
than seventy million dollars in leases over the past seven years.
We differentiate ourselves from traditional leasing companies in
the fact that this is &quot;our&quot; industry. Buying,
refurbishing and reselling micros is what we do best and it shows
in the very competitive rates and services we offer to our
customers. Flexibility is a key benefit in leasing and a key
strength at PCR. Find out why leasing, a service which has been
around for thousands of years, is growing so rapidly in an
industry which has been around for fifteen years. </p>

		<DT><STRONG>Where can I find customer support online?</STRONG><P>
		
		<DD><a href="http://www.info.apple.com/">Get Info</A> is the primary source for technical
		information, support information, and software updates for Apple customers. Get Info offers
		the searchable <a href="http://til.info.apple.com/">Technical Information Library</A>
		articles, interactive <a href="http://support.info.apple.com/tso/tso-home.html">discussion
		forums</A> for exchanging problems and solutions, pointers to the latest
		<a href="http://www.info.apple.com/swupdates/">software updates</A>, and
		<a href="http://www.info.apple.com/">more</A>.<P>

		<DT><STRONG>What about email customer support?</STRONG><P>
		
		<DD>Apple does not provide general email technical support at this time. Please check the
		resources listed on Apple's "<A HREF="http://www.info.apple.com/">Get Info</A>" site for the
		latest customer support information.<P>

		<DT><STRONG>Where can I download Apple software updates?</STRONG><P>
		
		<DD>The webmaster's advice is to start with <A HREF="http://www.info.apple.com/swupdates/">
		Software Updates at www.info.apple.com</A> which provides live links to all the currently
		active mirrors of Apple's software updates archive.<P>
				
		<DT><STRONG>Why are the Apple software update sites so busy?</STRONG><P>
		
		<DD>Apple's FTP servers handle hundreds of thousands of requests each week. Sometimes,
		especially after a popular upgrade has been announced, the servers get busy and refuse
		additional connections in order to serve the connections they are already processing. A
		system software update may consist of 14 1.4 MB disk images and will probably fill the
		servers to capacity for a week or so.<P>
		
		If you are trying to get through at these times, here are some strategies for you:
			<UL>
			<LI>Try your request at off hours (usually 11 pm to 6 am Central time for
			www.info.apple.com and 11 pm to 6 am Pacific for www.support.apple.com)
			<LI>Use the World Wide Web pages to start your search and only switch to FTP when you
			need to transfer software.
			<LI>Try again in a few days
			</UL><P>


		<DT><STRONG>I've heard that Apple is working on a new product called (insert any code name
		here)</STRONG><P>
		
		<DD>It is not Apple's policy to comment on un-announced products, whether or not they
		actually exist.  We are not allowed to comment on products that are under development and
		are not announced.  We also can't give release dates for products. You can look in the
		following places for our earliest discussions of new products:<P>
		
			<DL>
			<DT><STRONG><A HREF="http://product.info.apple.com/pr/thismonth.html">Press Release
			Library</A></STRONG>
				<DD>Product announcements are generally accompanied by a press release which often
				gives many of the specifications people are interested in.<P>
			<DT><STRONG><A HREF="http://www.apple.com/source/">The Source</A></STRONG>
				<DD>This site, published for the press and analyst community by Apple's Public
				Relations organization, centralizes pointers to the latest breaking news about Apple
				and its plans for the future.<P>
			<DT><STRONG><A HREF="http://www.macos.apple.com/">Mac OS home page</A></STRONG>
				<DD>The Mac OS team has also posted information about future developments in the
				Macintosh operating system on the Mac OS Web site.<P>
				
			</DL>
			
			<STRONG><DT>
			Why can't I find a price list on Apple's web pages?</STRONG>
			<P>
				<DD>Our server is intended to serve the entire world.  The prices for our 
				products are strongly affected by your geographical location, discounts you may be 
				entitled to, and other business factors.  Therefore, we do not list prices.  
				The best way to find out how much something will cost is to call your local 
				dealer(s).
				<P>
	
			<STRONG><DT>
			What kind of discounts can college students get on Apple products?</STRONG>
			<P>
				<DD>Apple works through campus resellers for most sales to college students. 
				Contact your campus reseller for more information.  
				<A HREF="http://hed.info.apple.com/">Apple's Virtual Campus</A> Web site contains a 
				list of <A HREF="http://hed.info.apple.com/resellers.html">campus resellers online.
				</A> If your campus does not have a reseller, please call 1-800-877-4433.
				<P>

			<STRONG><DT>
			How can I send email to someone I know who works at Apple?</STRONG>
			<P>
				<DD>Apple does not have a public index of the email addresses of its employees, and we cannot guarantee that email sent to the webmaster will be forwarded to an internal email address. 
				<P>

			<STRONG><DT> 
			I need to license Apple software for distribution to my clients, usergroup, or company.  
			Whom should I contact?</STRONG>
			<P> 
				<DD>In order to legally distribute Apple software, you will need to file a 
				licensing agreement with Apple Software Licensing. For further details, look at the 
				<A HREF="http://dev.info.apple.com/ngs/lpp/adrpub/docs/mkt/registering/swl/swl.shtml">Software Licensing</A>  page at 
				http://dev.info.apple.com/ngs/lpp/adrpub/docs/mkt/registering/swl/swl.shtml or contact the Software Licensing 
				department at:<BR>

				<P>

			<STRONG><DT>My web page has a link back to Apple's web page.  Is there a logo I can use for this 
			link?</STRONG>
			<P>
				<DD>Thank you very much for asking!  For links to Apple's Web site 
				(<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/">http://www.apple.com/</A>), you may license and use 
				one of two buttons featuring the Apple logo.  For a site which was created using 
				Apple technology or one which is using a Macintosh-based server, you may want to 
				license and use the "Apple Technology at Work" banner. All the details about 
				licensing and using the Apple button trademarks are available online at 
				<A HREF="http://www.servers.apple.com/AppleLogo/">
				http://www.servers.apple.com/AppleLogo/</A>

			How can I become a beta tester for Apple?</STRONG>
			<P>
				<DD>Visit our <A HREF="http://www.cqf.apple.com/">Customer Quality 
                        Feedback (CQF)</A> site. CQF is an Apple end-user seeding program that provides you, as 
                        an Apple customer, with an opportunity to influence the development of Apple 
                        products. <p>

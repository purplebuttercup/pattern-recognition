        <BLOCKQUOTE>
        Silicon Shop is the Silicon Graphics Web store that allows U.S.
Customers to
        purchase selected Silicon Graphics products using a credit
card.  The
        store was created to allow the convenient ordering of items from your
desktop computer; it
        serves to supplement our field and telesales force. <BR><BR>

        The store has fully automatic credit card
         processing using CyberCash<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>, in a
secure environment that meets
        the highest industry standards.  Silicon Shop currently offers the
following products:<BR><BR>

        <UL>
                <LI>Parts and Peripherals for the O2 and OCTANE desktop lines
(e.g. cables, memory, monitors)
                <LI>IRIX Software line, including Networking titles  (over 100
titles)
                <LI>Remarketed Systems and Peripherals  (e.g. Indigo)
                <LI>Training (e.g. Self-Paced Training, and CBT Training)
                <LI>Manuals (over 100 titles)
                <LI>...with lots more coming in the future!
        </UL>


	In addition to offering products for sale, Silicon Shop also allows
customers to Request Quotations on O2 and OCTANE systems via our Telesales
Representatives.
        A configurator allows users to easily build their own desktop system,
complete with Support options, and also lets them save their
items in a
        "product basket" for future reference (or routing).  In addition,
detailed
        product information is available to assist with purchase decisions.

COMMUNICATION</strong></font></p>
<p align="left">Envision has been dedicated to integrating audio,
video, computer and communications technology solutions for more
than a decade. Their solutions are designed to enhance both your
internal and external communications capabilitites and
effectiveness. Envision provides rental and staging for
presentations, multimedia solutions, video-conferencing
technology and a wide array of presentation equipment to improve
workplace efficiency and assist you in presenting a polished
image.</p>
<p align="left">The global marketplace has become a reality. With
it comes the need for supporting technology. Envision has been a
leading integrator utilizing technologies within the computer,
audio/visual and communications industries for more than ten
years. We are focused on providing electronic solutions that
bring people and ideas together. This focus includes four key
areas:</p>
<p align="left">Welcome to the exciting world of <a
href="emi.htm">multimedia</a>. Ideas and concepts that have been
costly or difficult to implement are now becoming the standard
presentation tools of today. Present your product, idea, or
corporate image in ways never before possible. At Envision our
goal is to work with your current presentation and advertising
tools and enhance them with computer animation, sound, and
interaction. An Envision media consultant can aid you in the
design of your own custom multimedia solution. These
possibilities are limited only by your imagination - making them
real is our job. </p>
<p align="left">Video-conferencing and satellite communication
technologies. Need to communicate face-to-face with remote
offices or vital customers? Instead of turning to a travel agent,
turn to Envision. We have more than a decade of experience in
videoconferencing technologies, including satellite downlinking
and uplinking, telephone full motion and still video
conferencing. Envision has been tapped NASA and Apple Computer to
assist in bringing geographically-dispersed personnel together. </p>
<p align="left">Document management and imaging. Too much paper
around the office? Envision also designs scalable document
management and imaging solutions to fit a wide variety of
applications. With our assistance, any user in your organization
can locate, view, print and fax documents and images from their
desktop, saving time, money and resources. </p>
<p align="left">Next-step technology presentation equipment.
Envision also designs and provides, via sale rental, training and
conference facilities for education, government and industry Our
multimedia capabilities include integrating production systems
for interactive video, kiosks, videotape and film. Bringing
traditional A/V-type presentations into the computer world
requires special talent which Envision has been providing for
years. We have the ability to electronically merge color
photography with text and video to provide output for a number of
different media. </p>

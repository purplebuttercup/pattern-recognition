STRATUS REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EPS GREW 71 PERCENT

<FONT SIZE="+2">M</FONT>ARLBORO, Mass., October 22, 1997 --  Stratus Computer, Inc. <A HREF="http://www.stockmaster.com/sm/g/S/SRA.html">(NYSE:SRA)</A>
today reported that revenues for the third quarter ended September 28,
1997 totaled $175.0 million, up 17 percent from $150.0 million in the
previous year's third quarter.  Earnings and earnings per share in
1997's third quarter were $19.3 million and $0.77, respectively,
compared to $10.8 million and $0.45 in the third quarter of 1996,
representing increases of 79 percent and 71 percent, respectively.
<P>
Revenues for the nine months ended September 28, 1997 were $498.3
million, up 15 percent from the $433.2 million Stratus reported for the
first nine months of 1996.  Earnings and earnings per share for the
period were $51.4 million and $2.10, respectively, compared to $25.8
million and $1.09 for the same period a year ago, representing increases
of 99 percent and 93 percent, respectively.
<P>
"Strong telecommunications revenue growth continued in quarter three,
up 44 percent from last year, and represented 54 percent of total
product revenue," said Bruce Sachs, Stratus president and CEO. The
company reported that its product revenue grew 23 percent in the current
quarter over the third quarter of 1996.  "Although we were pleased with
the third quarter growth rates, we expect slower growth in the fourth
quarter of 1997 and in 1998," said Sachs.  Stratus' balance sheet 
strengthened in its third quarter,  with cash growing to $248
million.  Days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased to 68 days from 79
in the second quarter of 1997.  Inventory days on hand decreased to 81
days from 86 in the second quarter of 1997.
<P>
"We reached two major new product milestones this quarter," continued
Sachs.  "We announced our newest generation of Continuum<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">&reg;</FONT></SUP> systems, based
on the Hewlett-Packard<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> PA-RISC 8000 microprocessor.  Beginning with the
Continuum Series 400 running our implementation of the Hewlett-Packard  
HP-UX<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> operating system, these systems offer three to five times the 
performance of the previous models, at similar pricing. The remainder of 
the Continuum line will begin shipping with the 8000 chip during the next 
two quarters, and the entire family will offer both HP-UX and the Stratus 
FTX<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> operating system, a native port of UNIX<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">&reg;</FONT></SUP> SVR 4.0. The Stratus<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">&reg;</FONT></SUP> 
VOS system will follow on mid-range and high-end Continuums. The new 
generation will be 100 percent binary compatible with the previous generation 
of Continuum systems. Also this quarter, we began shipments of RADIO 
Cluster<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> systems based on the Pentium<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">&reg;</FONT></SUP> Pro microprocessor and running 
Windows NT<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">&reg;</FONT></SUP>.   These achievements underscore our long-standing commitment 
to deliver open systems with the highest levels of computer reliability, 
very attractive price-performance, and maximum protection for our customers' 
investments in their applications," said Sachs.
<P>
Stratus also announced two major alliances to provide Internet-based
financial services.  Stratus and Security First Technologies (S1) will
deliver S1's scalable, secure Internet banking solution using Stratus
Continuum computers.  Stratus will also partner with RBT Engineering
Systems and Software, and The PowerHouse Systems Group, to offer an
integrated Internet-based securities trading system, featuring
"straight-through processing" from trade entry to settlement.   The 
company also announced that it had been selected as the hardware
platform for new Internet electronic commerce services to be supplied by
Belgacom, Belgium's telecommunications provider. Using software supplied
by Stratus partner Open Market, Inc., Belgacom's customers will be able
to market their products via the Internet without developing their own
systems.

<blockquote>
<P><B>HOUSTON, November 17, 1997</B> - Reinforcing its commitment to the handheld market, Compaq Computer Corporation (<A HREF="/corporate/ir/">NYSE: CPQ</A>) today announced the new Compaq C-Series PC companion, the first professional handheld PC aimed at the mobile business user who requires fast, easy and secure access to information. The Compaq-designed C-Series features cutting-edge technology, robust management and security capabilities, several exclusive software bundles, and support for the Microsoft Windows CE 2.0 operating system.  It will be shipping worldwide during the first half of 1998, at which time pricing will be made available.</P>
<P>Compaq will be conducting technology demonstrations of the new PC companion at COMDEX in Las Vegas between November 17 and November 21 in the Microsoft Partner Pavilion, Booth number L2212, located in the Las Vegas Convention Center.  </P>
<P> &quot;This announcement strengthens Compaq's commitment to providing customers with total business solutions and represents a significant product breakthrough,&quot; said Mike Winkler, Senior Vice President and Group General Manager, PC Products Group, Compaq Computer Corporation.  &quot;The new Compaq C-Series, intended to be an extension of a portable or desktop computer, is designed to make connectivity as easy as possible.  Business professionals will be able to more efficiently access and manipulate large amounts of valuable personal and corporate information from their notebooks, desktops, and networks, both at home and at work.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The Compaq C-Series is ideal for today's mobile professionals who</P>
<P>constantly need access to information wherever they work,&quot; said Harel Kodesh, General Manager of the consumer appliance group at Microsoft.  &quot;Compaq's new PC companion, powered by Windows CE 2.0, takes full advantage of the functionality and features in this second generation operating system.&quot;</P>
<P>The new Compaq PC companion features the fastest and most powerful handheld processor and modem technologies available, bright color and monochrome displays, and Windows CE 2.0, the newest member of the Microsoft Windows operating system family.  With Windows CE 2.0 customers can effortlessly synchronize critical information between their desktop and handheld PC.  Also included with the Compaq C-Series are new enhanced Pocket versions of desktop applications such as Outlook, with its suite of e-mail Inbox, Calendar, Contacts and Tasks applications,  Internet Explorer, PowerPoint, Word and Excel, making it easy to learn and use. </P>
<P>&quot;As the world's leading PC supplier, Compaq's continued presence in the handheld products arena complements the company's existing and future desktop and notebook products by focusing on the handheld device's link and synchronization to other Windows-based computers for easy connectivity and information sharing,&quot; added Winkler.  &quot;The Compaq C-Series continues our tradition of delivering high-quality and reliable PC products and furthers Compaq's goal to deliver overall computing solutions.&quot;</P>

<B>Target Markets</B>
<P>The Compaq C-Series will appeal to a broad number of business professionals who use desktop or portable PCs.  Additionally, MIS professionals and corporate end users will benefit from the PC companion's security, asset management, data synchronization and remote access capabilities.  Target markets will include Compaq's traditional corporate customers, as well as individuals within small- to medium-sized businesses, work-at-home individuals and sophisticated customers, who purchase PC companions for their own professional and personal advancement.  </P>
<P>&quot;With the Compaq PC companion, I have been able to create a virtual paperless office and significantly boost my productivity while I am away from the office,&quot; said Richard Cobello, Manager, Multimedia Development, GE Powersystems.  &quot;We expect the enhanced PC companion, with its Compaq-engineered design and new features, will continue to be an irreplaceable business tool and a important component of our total computing solution.&quot;</P>

<B>Hardware Features</B>
<P>The new PC companion integrates the fastest RISC-based processor optimized for Windows CE, providing instant &quot;on&quot;, fast calculations and smooth scrolling through documents.  In addition, a high-performance integrated modem provides fast and easy access to e-mail, remote PC synchronization and Internet access.  The full-width color or monochrome display supports a 640 by 240 resolution, which allows more information to be seen on the screen at one time. With the double bright backlight display, customers can select two brightness settings, which improves viewing in any type of lighting condition.</P>
<P>For easy data entry, it features an integrated microphone and voice recording capability, and an optimized keyboard.  Fast EDO RAM increases system performance and storage capabilities, while the upgradeable ROM provides secure and permanent storage of the operating system and all primary applications. An infrared port provides wireless connectivity to exchange PIM information or files instantly with a desktop or notebook PC.  In addition, a touch screen allows the customer to use a finger or the included stylus to navigate through the Windows CE environment.</P>

<B>Connectivity Features</B>
<P>Designed for the easiest setup and synchronization, the Compaq C-Series links to a PC using a bundled serial cable.  Through the serial port connection, the Microsoft Windows CE Services automatically detects a connected PC companion, initiates communication and provides automatic/continuous replication and synchronization of calendar, tasks, and e-mails.</P>
<P>Remote Networking uses the Point-to-Point protocol for communications between a PC companion and a host computer.  Compaq's PC companion can be connected either to a corporate LAN through a Remote Access Service account or to the Internet through an Internet Service Provider.</P>

<B>Software Bundles</B>
<P>Compaq has been working with a number of Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) to develop applications for the PC companion, some of which are exclusive to Compaq. For example, River Run's Mail on the Run, will allow customers to access e-mail including cc:mail and Microsoft Mail.  CIC's QuickNotes and SpellCheck will collect handwritten notes and organizes them by date, while Compaq's Pocket Carbon Copy (formerly Microcom Carbon Copy) will provide remote access and file transfer capabilities.</P>

<B>Additional Key Product Features</B>
<P>The Compaq C-Series features robust security and management features, which lower the cost of ownership and protect valuable information stored in the system from being deleted, lost or stolen. In addition, the PC companion is covered under Compaq's generous support umbrella known as CompaqCare, which includes a one-year mail-in warranty, round-the-clock support, and on-line support forms.</P>

<B>Windows CE 2.0 Upgrade</B>
<P>For current PC companion customers, Compaq is offering a Windows CE 2.0 user- installable ROM upgrade.  The upgrade will also include an additional 2MB of memory for customers who have not previously upgraded their unit with the 2MB memory module.  With the upgrade, customers will be able to use new Windows CE 2.0 features such as improved connectivity and support for e-mail attachments.  The upgrade is expected to be available December 1997 through authorized Compaq resellers or Compaq Direct Plus at 1-800-888-8177. </P>

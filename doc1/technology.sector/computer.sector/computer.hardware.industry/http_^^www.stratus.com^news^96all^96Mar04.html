Solution Provides Continuously Available, Secure Platform for Electronic
Commerce Over the Internet

</B></I></CENTER><P>


Marlboro, Mass., -- March 4, 1996 -- Stratus Computer, Inc. (Marlboro, Mass.)
today announced that it will market, sell, and support Internet business
software products from Open Market, Inc. (Cambridge, Mass.). The Stratus-Open
Market solution will be marketed by Stratus worldwide, and will provide
businesses with a continuously available, secure platform to conduct electronic
commerce over the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
The products announced today by Open Market, OM-Transact. and OM-Axcess.,
will be available on StratusR ContinuumR Systems running FTXR, Stratus'
UNIXR System V, Release 4-based operating system in June 1996. OM-Axcess
provides selective and secure access to World Wide Web-based content. OM-Transact
provides a complete secure infrastructure for Internet commerce.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Open Market, like Stratus, is focused on open business solutions for
Internet electronic commerce,&quot; said Patrick Farley, Stratus' director
of messaging products. &quot;We believe that Open Market has a significant
lead in the conception and design of the necessary back-office technology
to support secure Internet commerce. OM-Transact is the only available product
that meets our customers' requirements for authentication, authorization,
and settlement of Web-based transactions.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our agreement with Open Market enables us to offer complete business
solutions to support Internet commerce,&quot; Farley continued. &quot;New
customers are looking for these solutions, as are existing customers who
use Stratus hardware and software products to support secure electronic
payments in the financial services, retail, and telecommunications industries.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Said Gary Eichhorn, CEO of Open Market, &quot;Stratus is recognized industry-wide
for their commitment to continuous availability and the ability to support
high volumes of transactions for mission-critical applications. The growth
of Internet-based commerce will require back-office payment systems, like
OM-Transact, that are available on a continuous basis 365 days a year. The
combination of Stratus hardware and the Open Market software products will
provide users with off-the-shelf, reliable, secure Internet-based commerce
systems that meet the levels of availability required by purchasers, consumers,
and service providers worldwide.&quot;<BR>
<H4>Stratus Continuum Systems </H4>
Stratus Continuum Systems are designed to provide the highest levels of
system availability through hardware fault-tolerance and Stratus' unique
online service capabilities. Stratus systems' self-diagnosis capabilities
detect and diagnose potential problems online, and automatically dial a
Stratus Customer Assistance Center (CAC). If necessary, replacement parts
are sent out automatically from the CAC for next day delivery. The system's
continuous availability features keep the application running without interruption
or performance degradation. Most parts can be replaced by the user by simply
sliding one component out and sliding a new one in while the system runs
at peak performance.<BR>
<H4>OM-Transact. Product Profile </H4>
Open Market's OM-Transact is the only software available that offers companies
a complete back-office infrastructure for secure Internet commerce. Only
OM-Transact enables companies to offer secure payment, complete order management,
and online customer service. Buyers and merchants benefit from operating
in a secure and robust transaction environment. Like all Open Market software
products, OM-Transact is a completely open, flexible system that works with
all browsers, security protocols, and payment methods.<BR>
<H4>OM-Axcess. Product Profile </H4>
Open Market's OM-Axcess server software is a toolkit designed to support
a company's Web applications. By centrally managing the authentication and
authorization of end users, OM-Axcess facilitates management of Web-based
information and manages access to proprietary corporate data distributed
across the Web. And, because it's a toolkit, it can be built into multiple
applications.<BR>

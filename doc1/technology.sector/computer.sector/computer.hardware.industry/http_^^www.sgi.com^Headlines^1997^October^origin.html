<FONT FACE="HELVETICA">Bandwidth is the ability to get data where you want it, when you want it
there.  In a world without bandwidth, the fastest processor is starved
for data, business critical applications stall, and the response time on
web sites is slow enough to drive customers to the competition. With 
full bandwidth scalability, Silicon Graphics' Origin<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> 
Servers are ideal for expanding or reallocating 
valuable compute power. Origin Servers grow in economical, modular
building blocks, each of which adds the full range of capabilities of a
traditional computer, all of which are managed as a single machine.
<P>
The revolutionary new ccNUMA architecture makes possible 
levels of power and performance that were previously unaffordable and 
technically unattainable. Origin Servers offer tremendous solution capacities, 
scaling to 400TB
on-line Fibrechannel disk and 256GB main memory. Whether hosting a data
warehouse, storing and retrieving product design data or serving
thousands of concurrent users, Origin Servers offer the scalable
bandwidth to provide efficient response times. Origin has
the throughput capability to back-up a terabyte of data in under an
hour. Origin delivers industry-leading VLM database performance. Origin
reliably serves production enterprise environments with 99.9% uptime
requirements.
<P>
The breadth of the Silicon Graphics product line and the attention we
pay to making our products work together and work well within a
heterogeneous environment make us the partner of choice for innovative
enterprises in a variety of industries.

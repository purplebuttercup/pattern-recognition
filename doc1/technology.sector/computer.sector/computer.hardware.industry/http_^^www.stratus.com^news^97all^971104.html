Fault-Tolerant Stratus Systems and Middleware
at the Forefront of Innovative Telecom Applications


</B></I></CENTER><P>



<FONT SIZE="+2">M</FONT>arlboro, Mass., November 4, 1997 Stratus Computer, Inc. today
announced that its systems now provide essential Home Location Register
(HLR) capabilities to 20 million wireless telecommunications subscribers
around the globe, making Stratus<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">&reg;</FONT></SUP> systems the single most widely used
computer-based platform for HLR.
<P>
HLRs are vital to the smooth operation of wireless telecommunications
networks, because they handle two core functions: subscriber mobility
management and subscriber data management. They store data such as
subscribers' telephone numbers, current locations, and available
supplementary services.
<P>
Because HLR applications must always be up and running, fault-tolerant
Stratus Continuum<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">&reg;</FONT></SUP> Series systems and the company's extensive family of
standards-compliant telecommunications middleware - including the
Stratus Intelligent Network Application Platform (SINAP<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP>) - have become
a top platform choice among telecommunications service providers,
application developers, and infrastructure suppliers.
<P>
"As the demand for mobile calling services continues to rise,
telecommunications providers count on Stratus to deliver the reliable
hardware and comprehensive telecom middleware that has proven so
successful in many of the world's most innovative wireless networks,"
said John Scanlon, Vice President of Telecommunications Systems at
Stratus. "Service providers find Stratus platforms unmatched for robust
HLR operation in addition to other critical, intelligent network (IN)
applications, such as local number portability. Wireless and wireline
customers alike value our hands-on expertise in IN."
<P>
Supplying Leading-Edge Solutions
Wireless networks are evolving to a distributed, software-driven model,
notes Mark Lowenstein, Vice President of the Yankee Group's
Wireless/Mobile practice. "Companies such as Stratus are providing the
key building blocks for this model, enabling quicker 
development of enhanced services, and real-time access to customer data
for a host of customer registration, authentication, billing, and
customer care applications," said Lowenstein.
<P>
Among the international market leaders that have delivered HLRs powered
by Stratus platforms is NEC in Japan, a major supplier of cellular and
PCS (personal communications service) PCS systems to wireless service
providers in Japan and worldwide.
<P>
In South Korea, LG Information and Communications Limited (LGIC) has
developed Stratus-based HLR software used by PCS provider SK Telecom
(formerly known as Korea Mobile Telecom). LGIC and Stratus recently
launched a partnership to make an enhanced version of LGIC's
standards-compliant IS-41C HLR available internationally.
<P>
Orange plc, a national digital wireless phone service provider in the
United Kingdom, last month announced that it is ready to meet a December
1998 regulatory mandate for number portability. Orange's ability to
quickly respond to the mandate is due to the Stratus-based IN platform
that it originally deployed for its Service Location Register (SLR), an
innovative implementation of subscription management and call
processing.
<P>
Proven Telecom Middleware
In addition to its fault-tolerant Continuum family of UNIX<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">&reg;</FONT></SUP> systems,
Stratus provides a suite of telecommunications middleware based on
SINAP, the successful Signaling System 7 platform installed in more than
60 wireless and wireline providers' networks. Application developers and
customers depend on this mature platform for HLR and local number
portability (LNP) as well as short message service, caller name, voice
messaging, prepaid calling, personal number, and other IN applications.
<P>
SCEnic<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> software, the Stratus Service Creation Environment, builds upon
the capabilities of SINAP to accelerate the development, testing, and
deployment of continuously available IN solutions. Open, standards-based
SCEnic products include SCEnic/Service Control Point (SCP),
SCEnic/Service Node (SN), and SCEnic/Mobility.
<P>

<p align="left"><strong>TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS</strong></p>
<p align="left">1995 marked another first for your company.
Revenues crossed the $200 million mark, reaching $230.7 million
for the year ended January 5th, 1996 - a 59.6% increase compared
to 1994. Even more impressive, in an industry known for intense
competition, net income rose 60.1%, yielding earnings per share
of $1.64. </p>
<p align="left">We believe that the best is yet to come. </p>
<p align="left">In January, 1996, the Company's central
distribution and configuration centers, as well as its inbound
order desk, moved into their new facility in Hebron, Kentucky,
providing much needed space for expansion. To use an overworked
phrase, this new facility is truly state-of-the-art. It was
designed with an eye towards our future, with an emphasis on
efficiency, security and flexibility.</p>
<p align="left">On March 14, 1996, the Company completed the
acquisition of The Computer Supply Store (TCCS), Iowa's largest
computer reseller. TCCS, with 1995 revenues of $60 million, is
based in Des Moines and has an excellent reputation as a
full-service provider that understands the meaning of &quot;going
the extra mile&quot; to satisfy customers. This acquisition,
combined with our new Indianapolis location, provides the Company
with a strong geographic and customer base upon which to further
expand. </p>
<p align="left">In May, the Company's headquarters, Cincinnati
regional facility, CommTec and Envision offices will combine in a
new facility adjacent to the Hebron complex. In addition to
providing the Company with economies of scale, the move will
encourage increased interaction between the Company's different
divisions. We believe that this synergy will have a positive
impact on all facets of the business.</p>
<p align="left">Our goal for 1996 is to continue following the
blueprint for success that has lead the Company to where it is
today. To continue the expansion of our services business, seek
to perform even more services for the customers we currently
serve, aggressively seek new customers and new markets and to
remain focused on cost control and efficiency.</p>

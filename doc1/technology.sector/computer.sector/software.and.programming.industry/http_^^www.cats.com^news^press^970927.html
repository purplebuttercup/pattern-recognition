<p><strong>Palo Alto, CA, October 27, 1997 </strong>- C·ATS Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:
CATX), a leading provider of strategic risk management solutions, today announced that
Daiwa America Corp., the North American subsidiary of Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd., has
chosen C·ATS Software technology for its derivatives trading and risk management. C·ATS
was selected in a competitive product analysis conducted by Daiwa. </p>

<p>&quot;As market-makers in the international bond market, we needed a broad-based
solution for interest-rate risk management and derivatives trading that not only provides
deal-capture for our front office, but also pricing, risk management and accounting.
Against competing systems, C·ATS proved their ability to easily handle unusual instrument
structures, while providing a well-priced, fully integrated, plug-and-play solution,&quot;
said Mark Finston, executive vice president and CFO of Daiwa's New York operation. </p>

management and accounting with a general ledger interface, has already been installed. </p>

<p>&quot;We are delighted to welcome Daiwa America to our group of outstanding North
American clients,&quot; said David Gilbert, president and COO of C·ATS Software.
&quot;Instrument flexibility and ease of implementation are among C·ATS' strengths, and
we were gratified to see these proven in a competitive situation. We look forward to

requirements.&quot; </p>

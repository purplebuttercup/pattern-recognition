<P><B><A NAME="Training_courses">Training courses</B></A> emphasize the solution of real chemical problems, rather than simply teaching
an interface. Examples are taken from the chemical literature, and the use
of Tripos software to reproduce published results is demonstrated. A list
of <A HREF="courses.html">standard course offerings</A> is available, or you can obtain <A HREF="customtr.html">customized training</A>, where you select the mix of course topics that best address your research
needs. </P>
<P><B><A NAME="Project-based_Training">Project-based training</B></A> can range from one-on-one sessions with novice or experienced users, to
customized training based on problems sets involving customer-provided data.
The objective is to show the user how he or she can achieve the best models
with their data and our software. A special startup package is offered for
new sites, which includes installation plus several days personal instruction
to get the new customer &quot;up and running.&quot;</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Customization">Interface customization</B></A> is available to allow a quicker learning time for a given site, thus reducing
the time it will take to become proficient with Tripos software use. SPL
script writing for a customer-designated functionality is also possible.</P>

<FONT SIZE=4>PLATINUM Integrates Tools</FONT><BR>
<I>by Patrick Dryden</I><BR>
October 13, 1997<BR>
<BR>
Users of database and systems management software from PLATINUM <I>technology, inc.</I> are
relieved that the vendor's diverse tools are finally starting to work together. 
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
PLATINUM, in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., this week will release upgraded versions of nine point
products that for the first time will run on Windows NT and will include a common
interface and services. 
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
The interface enables a few of PLATINUM's widely used tools to work together as an
integrated suite called ProVision. Users may be able to save the hassle of forging links
themselves. An operator can pick among the tools to apply a mix of management
functions through a common console, information repository and set of alerts. 
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
Information system managers can upgrade or adopt PLATINUM tools that can be linked as
needed, instead of embracing a huge framework from competitors such as
Hewlett-Packard Co., Tivoli Systems, Inc. and Computer Associates International, Inc.
The goal is the same &#151; reduce the cost and risk of maintaining distributed client/server
applications. 
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
"ProVision promises quicker response, more convenience and less duplication of effort,"
said PLATINUM user Mike Mueller, a senior systems analyst at Northwestern Mutual Life
Insurance Co. in Milwaukee. 
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
The systems administrators and database administrators who care for 30 Unix servers at
Northwestern will see the same alarms and share automated responses, not work in
isolated consoles, Mueller said. 
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
Lack of integration bothered Jerry Burgen, systems and database administrator at E and L
Transport Co. in Wayne, Mich. Burgen said PLATINUM could offer only a developer's kit to
help him link six tools his company had acquired. 
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
"Now I look forward to putting aside my handwritten scripts to let my PLATINUM tools talk
to each other," Burgen said. 
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
Users said they want all their chosen tools to work together as soon as possible. But
PLATINUM has more than 100 point products; only a dozen will offer ProVision integration
by year's end. Even so, delivery of the PLATINUM Open Enterprise Management Services
technology promised two years ago has encouraged users to extend their fledgling suites.
"I'm not in love with PLATINUM to the point that they're the only vendor I'd evaluate, but
now I would tend to look there first," Mueller said. 
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
MidFirst Bank in Oklahoma City, runs only the AutoSys job scheduler from PLATINUM, but
it hopes to add four more tools to start building an enterprise management suite, said
Collin Douglas, Unix systems administrator at the bank. 
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
"Integration was their only weak point compared with alternatives like [CA's] Unicenter
TNG and [Tivoli's] TME 10," Douglas said. 
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
The ProVision option should trigger sales in the huge base of PLATINUM users, but PLATINUM
faces significant competition from framework players CA, HP and Tivoli, said Herb
VanHook, an analyst at Meta Group, Inc. in Westport, Conn.

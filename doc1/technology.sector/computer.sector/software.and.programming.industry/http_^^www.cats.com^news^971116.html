<hr>

Software To Head Operations In the Americas </b></font></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Palo Alto, CA, November 17, 1997</strong> &#150; C·ATS Software Inc. (NASDAQ:
CATX), a leading provider of integrated risk management solutions, today announced the
appointment of David Samuels to the positions of vice president and managing director for
the Americas, according to David Gilbert, president and COO of C·ATS. Samuels, who served
at C·ATS early in his career and most recently was vice president of sales for SunGard
Capital Markets, will head sales, service and implementations in the Americas from
headquarters in New York City.</p>

<p>&quot;We at C·ATS are delighted to welcome back David Samuels, one of the most
respected and successful sales and marketing executives in the trading systems and risk
management industry,&quot; said Rod Beckström, CEO of C·ATS. &quot;It is appropriate
that we have someone of David&#146;s caliber joining our executive management team and
leading our North American Operations as we build on our recent successes in expanding use
of our trading systems and establishing CARMA<sup>®</sup> as the leading solution in
enterprise risk management. We look forward to supporting him in building a model sales
and service organization in the Americas.&quot;</p>

<p>In accepting the position, Samuels noted, &quot;It is unusual to see an established
product suddenly rise to a position of absolute market dominance, but I believe that
C·ATS&#146; CARMA is in that enviable position. Today as risk managers and bank
executives look for enterprise credit risk solutions that will support rapid, real-time
analysis for intraday limits management and risk-adjusted capital analysis, the logical is
CARMA. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring C·ATS world-class solutions to
the forefront in the Americas.&quot;</p>

<p>Before rejoining C·ATS, Samuels was vice president of sales at SunGard Capital
Markets, responsible for all of the division&#146;s marketing and sales of enterprise risk
management and trading systems to major financial institutions and corporations in the
western hemisphere. Previously he was sales manager for North America, a position he
assumed when joining the firm in 1993.</p>

<p>Samuels managed North American sales and support for C·ATS Software in the early part
of the decade, introducing a number of money-center financial institutions to C·ATS
trading systems. He subsequently was vice president of sales and marketing for E.J.V.
Partners, a consortium of banks and securities firms.</p>

<p>A graduate of State University of New York at Albany, Samuels is a member of the Global
Association of Risk Professionals, Software Publishers Association, American Management
Association, and PSE, a professional sales and marketing association.</p>

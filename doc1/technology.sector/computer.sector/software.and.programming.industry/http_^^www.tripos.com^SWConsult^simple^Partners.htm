Tripos Software Consulting Services&nbsp;</H2>
<I>Partnering with you and others to provide the services you require</I>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="CG Omega">We hear often from our clients that
they do not wish to be dependent upon a single vendor to provide critical
applications and services.&nbsp; We understand that -- it's not a position
that Tripos wants to be in, either.&nbsp; At the same time, both vendors
and clients seek to enter into close, but non-exclusive partnerships. This
is why Tripos has demonstrated our willingness and success in working with
other vendors, in order to provide our clients with superior service.&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="CG Omega"><B>ORACLE:</B>&nbsp; An Alliance
partner of <A HREF="http://www.oracle.com">ORACLE</A>, Tripos develops
applications to work with ORACLE RDB systems. We are working jointly with
ORACLE to design and build Scientific Information systems for multiple
pharmaceutical clients.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="CG Omega"><B>SGI:</B> A strategic <A HREF="http://www.sgi.com/Products/hardware/desktop/partners/index.html#sciences">partner</A>
of <A HREF="http://www.sgi.com">Silicon Graphics</A> for several years,
we have considerable experience working with SGI hardware and staff, worldwide.
We utilize SGI Challenge and <A HREF="http://www.sgi.com/Products/hardware/servers/">Origin
servers</A> for Collaborative Network Computing Solutions in many client
sites, as well as our own corporate network. We are an active value-added
reseller of SGI systems.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="CG Omega"><B>MDL:</B> We've been working with
<A HREF="http://www.mdli.com">MDL</A>, the industry leader in Chemical
Information Systems, in order to provide better integration of MDL products
with our own Discovery Systems.&nbsp; Last year we shipped the <A HREF="http://www.tripos.com/press/mdlannounce.html">MTS</A>
(MDL translation system) to our many <A HREF="../../press/MDLunity27.html">Unity</A>
customers, linking their corporate chemical databases with the advanced
Unity 3D searching capabilities. We've also designed several of our Web-based
clients so that they can access <A HREF="http://www.mdli.com/prod/products.html">ISIS</A>
directly, for those users with ISIS licenses. We are also working jointly
with MDL to provide ChemInformatics systems to some major Pharmaceutical
companies.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="CG Omega"><B>Netscape:</B> An AffiliatePlus
partner of <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com">Netscape</A>, we develop
solutions using Netscape servers and clients, and resell Netscape software.
The Tripos corporate intranet is built on the Netscape Enterprise Server
and Communicator clients.&nbsp;</FONT></TD>

        Penny Increase<br>
        in Postage Has Pros and Cons for Mailers</b></font> <p>You
        have probably already heard the big news from the
        U.S.P.S.: on July 1, the Board of Governors presented a
        rate case to the Postal Rate Commission, requesting a
        one-cent increase in U.S. postage rates, possibly
        effective in May 1998. But how will this increase affect
        business mailers?</p>
        <p>After nearly three and a half years of steady postage
        prices, the second longest period of rate stability in
        the 26-year history of the Postal Service, the
        announcement of a penny increase came as no surprise to
        many industry analysts. On the whole, many mailers seemed
        pleased with the small jump in the average rate. After
        all, a 33-cent rate is still an increase of only 3.1%
        over the existing price. A closer look, however, reveals
        that many First-Class automation mailers could face an
        increase closer to 5%, depending upon the level of
        automation chosen (basic, three-digit or five-digit).</p>
        <p><em><strong>Average 4% rate hike is expected for
        advertising mailers</strong></em></p>
        <p>The U.S.P.S.&#146;s proposal would enable many
        consumers to actually cut postage costs, but most
        high-volume advertising mailers will experience an
        increase. Additionally, business mailers opting to use
        the proposed new prepaid envelopes in order to save their
        customers money could find themselves faced with
        significantly higher administrative costs.</p>
        <p>Some of the biggest increases in postage dollars would
        come in the Enhanced Carrier Route (ECR) basic and
        automation rate categories. The proposal would make the
        ECR basic rate for letters the same price as for flats,
        causing those rates to jump about 10% on average. There
        is some good news for business mailers, however. Some
        categories within Standard (A) would actually enjoy
        decreases. For example, the rates for nonautomation
        presort letters would drop by as much as a penny if
        brought to the bulk mail center.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Rate case specifics</strong></em></p>
        <p>Under the proposed rate case, rates for all categories
        of domestic mail would change in varying amounts, based
        on their individual handling costs. The price for
        businesses to send a monthly statement would increase 4.6
        percent, or up to 1.1 cents per piece on average. The
        increase would average 4.5 percent across all domestic
        service, less than half of the expected 10 percent
        increase in the Consumer Price Index for the 41-month
        tenure of the 32-cent rate. The 1998 rates would also
        represent the second straight adjustment below inflation,
        effectively cutting the real price of First Class postage
        by seven percent since 1991. The Postal Rate Commission
        is expected to take about nine months to review the rate
        case.</p>
        <p>&quot;Today a penny doesn&#146;t go very far,&quot;
        says Dr. Tirso Del Junco, Chairman of the Postal Service
        Board of Governors. &quot;But a penny increase is all we
        need. It&#146;s just enough for the Postal Service to
        maintain universal mail service, offset projected losses,
        help us take record service performance to new heights
        for the nation, and keep rates steady to the year
        2000.&quot;</p>
        <p>Stay tuned for updates on the latest developments
        concerning this rate case.</p>

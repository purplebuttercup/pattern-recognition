Get a group of professionals together - doctors, lawyers, engineers, editors - of any age, anywhere in America and odds are, it won't be long before the conversation turns to golf.  It's no wonder.  Golf is the country's most popular participation sport.  That's why Ultradata Systems' GreensFinder is perfect for the "professional" golfer.<p>





GreensFinder tells golf enthusiasts virtually anything they would like to know about more than 10,000 courses across the United States.  With just a few keystrokes, GreensFinder lists all the golf courses in an area and tells distance and detailed travel directions to each course.  GreensFinder lists the course type (private, public, resort, etc.), the course hours, whether guests are admitted, and tee times.  It has a full list of phone numbers for information and reservations.  Once on the links, it converts to a four-play scorekeeper, so players can keep their minds on the real business at hand.<p>





GreensFinder goes beyond the basics to the kind of details serious golfers love: course descriptions, yardage, course ratings, even the designer who created the course. It provides the kind of insights that make for great golf-vacation planning. <p>

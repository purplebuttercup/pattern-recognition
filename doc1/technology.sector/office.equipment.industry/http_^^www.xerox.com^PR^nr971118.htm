<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>XEROX DROPS NETWORK PRINTER PRICES CHALLENGE HEWLETT-PACKARD, OTHERS<BR>
<I>DocuPrint 4517 and 4517 mp Are Industry's Most Affordable 17
ppm Models New DocuPrint N32 and N24 Off to Strong Start</i></H2>

ROCHESTER, N.Y., November 18, 1997 -- In its latest challenge to
its network printing competitors, Xerox Corporation today announced price reductions of up to 24 percent on the DocuPrint 4517 and 4517 mp, making the two network printers the most affordable models in their class.<p>
At prices up to $300 less than comparable products from Hewlett-Packard and others, the DocuPrint 4517 and 4517 mp are now the low-cost leaders in the 17-page-per-minute speed range.  With expected street prices starting at $975 and running costs of about a penny per page, the 4517 offers a lower total cost of ownership than the new 17 ppm HP LaserJet 4000 printers.<p>
In addition, Xerox announced availability and shipment of its 32- and 24-ppm printers DocuPrint N32 and N24 Network Laser Printers, which have had a strong start since their late September introduction.  Xerox reports thousands of customers' orders worldwide.<p>
"Xerox is committed to providing more value at a lower cost for network printing customers and channel partners," said Kevin Shea, senior vice
president and general manager, North American Office Channels, Xerox
Corporation.<p>
"Xerox is becoming a different kind of company -- one that is much more competitive and very quick on its feet," according to Richard Norton,
president, DocuTrends, a San Jose, Calif.-based research and consulting firm. "This price action and the positioning of the DocuPrint N32 and N24 tell us that Xerox will do whatever it takes to become a force in the network printer arena."<p>
The DocuPrint N32, with a street price starting around $2,900, is 33 percent faster and $500 less expensive than the closest comparable version of the HP LaserJet 5si.  The DocuPrint N24, with a street price around $2,450, costs about 30 percent less than a similarly configured 24 ppm HP LaserJet. <p>

<P>One xerographic duplicator stands up to the toughest tests of all - time and performance. The DocuLink 5690 builds upon the success of the Xerox 5090 family of duplicators, which <A HREF="awards.htm">continues to win awards</A> from recognized industry sources around the world.

<P><A HREF="buyers.htm">Buyer's Laboratory Inc.</A>, Dataquest, DataPro, <A HREF="hansons.htm">Hanson's Guidelines</A>, Better Buys for Business and many others have consistently described the 5090 family of products as the best duplicators in the business. 

<P>Today, the DocuLink 5690 takes its lineage one step further - to provide the best quality, the greatest range of flexibility, and fastest output of copies as well as the largest paper capacities on the market. You can offer more services and more professional-looking documents for your customers. In addition, major enhancements have opened up a range of options for present and future applications.<BR>

<A NAME="provenproductivity"><FONT COLOR="#CC0000"><H3>DocuLink 5690 adds up to the best in proven productivity</H3></FONT></A>
<P>The DocuLink 5690 builds on proven performance and provides the following enhancements and options:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>The versatile Interposer for the ability to choose from up to six &quot;pick points&quot; and to insert a wide variety of paper stocks directly into the finisher.
<LI> A productivity boosting ASF-135 Automatic Stapler Folder which can staple and fold documents.
<LI><A HREF="six.htm">Sixth Sense Remote Diagnostics Technology</A> for improved uptime.
<LI>Energy Star Software for improved energy efficiency.
  Xerox Digital Migration Strategy for handling 
 digital files today.

<HR>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#CC0000"><H3>The heart of the system:<BR> Proven performance</H3><BR></FONT>
<P>At the center of DocuLink 5690's proven reliability, enhanced capabilities, and increased performance is the time-tested 5090 family of products. It's still the fastest, light-lens duplicator in the market at, 135 copies per minute.

<P>The DocuLink 5690 constantly monitors area coverage and thus can copy a broad range of images and densities. Using Automated Xerographic Process Controls, every other image is checked, and quality adjustments are made automatically. This proven technology also assures that copy quality settings will be maintained, regardless of run lengths or area coverage.

<P>By using the Exception Programming, the operator can control copy quality on a page-by-page basis. Standard, light, dark, paste up, halftone, photo, and blue ink 
settings can be selected. In addition, there is a special control to adjust for lines, solids, and particularly challenging photographs.<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#CC0000"><H3>Handle more types of documents</H3><BR></FONT>

<P><IMG SRC="images/dhandler.gif" ALT="dhandler.gif - 14.6 K" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=157 HSPACE=5 ALIGN=left>A Universal Document Handler accepts virtually any kind of original. The Recirculating Document Handler holds 250 sheets, for simplexing or duplexing, in 16# - 110# weights. So, there's no need for splitting a large job into separate jobs and then compiling sets off-line. The Semi-Automatic Document Feeder accepts sizes from 
5&quot; x 8&quot; to 12&quot; x 17&quot; (European Metrics). The Computer Forms Feeder handles a 3&quot; (European Metrics) stack of unburst fan fold. Bound documents can be copied from the platen.<BR>
<BR><HR><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#CC0000"><H3>User interface puts all controls at your fingertips</H3> <BR></FONT>
<P><IMG SRC="images/monitor.gif" ALT="monitor.gif - 14.1 K" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=157 HSPACE=5 ALIGN=right>A 13&quot; (European Metrics)  full-color touch screen is used to program instructions for jobs. Shadowed icons represent the required feature making it easy for operators to intuitively program the DocuLink 5690. The touch screen is organized like a filing system with three file cabinets that contain all the job programming and service information.

<P>Zone Jam Clearance lets you respond to virtually any processor misfeed by clearing only one area in the paper path. Then, with Complete Job Recovery, you can pick up where you left off and finish a job accurately, without re-programming and without wasting impressions.<BR>
<BR><HR><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#CC0000"><H3>High-speed, in-line finishing lessens hand labor </H3><BR></FONT>
 <P>The DocuLink 5690 offers a variety of in-line finishing options to reduce manual, off-line work by operators. 
<P>In-line proportional stitching ensures a reliably tight and secure stitch. Sets of up to 70 sheets can be stitched in a single or dual position. The machine, using spools of high-tensile wire, adjusts and cuts a staple to the thickness of the document. Stitching placement is variable and can be adjusted automatically from the user interface. 
 <P>Thermal tape binding is standard on the DocuLink 5690 for 11&quot; (European Metrics) paper sizes. The binder can create books from 15 to 125 sheets and includes binding tapes in six color choice selections - red, white, black, blue, gray, and brown.<BR>
<BR><HR>
<BR> 
<FONT COLOR="#CC0000"><H3>DocuLink 5690 reduces energy consumption</H3><BR></FONT>

<P> DocuLink 5690 has been designed to meet the energy efficiency guidelines laid out in the EPA's Energy Star Program. 
 <P>Through a customer adjustable timer, which converts the DocuLink 5690 to the low power mode after a period of inactivity and then to shut down mode, you can 
 maximize your energy savings and efficiency. 
 <P>Also the DocuLink 5690 defaults to Duplex mode, which helps reduce paper consumption.<BR>

 <A NAME="keyfeatures"><FONT COLOR="#CC0000"><H3>Key Features</H3><BR></FONT></A>

<P> The DocuLink 5690 lets you handle more types of print jobs and offers more output versatility than any other duplicator in its class. The system allows a variety of 
 in-line finishing options and offers substantially 
 increased ease of use and operator productivity, 
 shortening job turnaround time and reducing labor 
 costs. The DocuLink 5690 also enables new applications and production capabilities.

<FONT COLOR="#CC0000"><H3>Handle More Complex Documents</H3></FONT>
<P>One unique aspect of the DocuLink 5690 is its ability 
to handle up to six different paper sources via the Interposer. It allows you to produce more complex 
documents and finish them in-line. 
<P>One key advantage of the Interposer is that it can feed materials in two directions - through the print engine for imaging (pre-process), or directly into the finisher (post-process). It eliminates the risk of sending specialty stocks such as preprinted offset or Xerographic color prints, Mylar tabs, and embossed stock through the fuser area. 
<P>The DocuLink 5690 is offered in two different 
configurations. 
<P>DocuLink 5690-I - which includes the 3-tray Interposer - offers the greatest potential for expanding applications. This 6 paper tray configuration allows up to 6 &quot;pick points.&quot;  Each Interposer tray has a 550-sheet capacity for a total system capacity of 5,950 sheets. Automatic Tray Switching allows multiple sets of trays to be programmed for continuous run.
<P><IMG SRC="images/papers.gif" ALT="papers.gif - 15.1 K" WIDTH=144 HEIGHT=144 HSPACE=5 ALIGN=left>DocuLink 5690- II - which includes the 2-tray Interposer - brings the total system capacity to 7,450 sheets, giving the DocuLink 5690-II the most capacity of any duplicator in its class. This five tray configuration allows up to 5 &quot;pick points.&quot; The top tray (tray 4) holds 550 sheets. The bottom tray (tray 5) is high capacity, holding 2600 sheets.
<P>Tray 4 feeds directly to the finisher (post-process) in both Interposer configurations. The remaining Interposer trays in both configurations can feed either post-process or pre-process.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H3><FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Accepts a greater variety of paper stocks</FONT></H3><P>The DocuLink 5690 increases the variety of applications that can be done in-line and provides operators with a nearly limitless paper supply. Longer runs can be completed faster via automatic switching from an empty tray to a full tray of the same size stock during a job run. In addition, trays can be loaded while the machine is running, reducing delays.
<P>All trays hold paper sizes 8&quot; x 10&quot; to 9&quot;x 14&quot; (European Metrics). Tray 3, 4, 5 and 6  hold oversize paper as large as 11&quot; x 17&quot; (European Metrics). All trays will feed paper stock  from 16# to 110# index weights. <BR>

are enhanced productivity accessories for the 
DocuLink 5690. 
<UL>
<LI>The ASF - 135 reduces the amount of labor and time to finish, trim and saddle stitch booklets.
<LI>The ASF - 135 folds, staples and trims 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; and 8.5&quot; x 14&quot; (European Metrics)  in-line, and 11&quot; x 17&quot; (European Metrics) off-line.
<LI>The ASF+135 will produce booklets which consist of 2 to 20 sheets of 20# paper. The maximum set thickness capacity is the equivalent of 19 sheets of 20# paper and one 110# cover.

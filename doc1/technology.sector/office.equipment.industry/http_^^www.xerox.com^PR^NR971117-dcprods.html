COMDEX, LAS VEGAS, November 17, 1997--Xerox today announced it
will deliver three network configurations of its flagship Document Centre family of digital office systems in early 1998.<p>

The models are the Document Centre 220ST and 230ST office systems, which are fully integrated systems that deliver network printing, faxing, scanning and copying from the desktop, and the modular Document Centre 230LP workgroup laser printer. The 230LP provides network printing and finishing at 30 ppm and allows users to add functions such as copying, faxing or scanning as desired.<p>

"This is an important milestone in our strategy to build a family of modular and upgradeable office document systems," said Mark R. Hill, vice president and general manager, Digital Systems Business Unit, Xerox Corporation.<p>

Designed with a unique document printing architecture, an embedded web server and a common browser-based client, the new Document Centre 220ST and 230ST will deliver network printing at 600 by 600 dpi and network scanning at 20 ppm and 30 ppm respectively.<p>

As part of its expanding network connectivity offering, Xerox also announced that it will bundle PostScriptreg. Level 2 from Adobereg. Systems Inc. on all connected Document Centre products.  PostScript 3 capability will be added to them in the second half of 1998.<p>

"The combination of the Xerox Document Centre Systems and Adobe PostScript offers customers unparalleled print quality and performance for even the most complex documents in today's office," said Fred Schwedner, senior vice president and general manager, Adobe Printing and Systems Division.<p>

The standard configurations of the Document Centre 220ST, 230ST and 230LP carry suggested manufacturer's list price of $11,595, $14,995 and $8,995 respectively.  A fax option for the Document Centre ST, which enables both hard copy and network faxing, carries a suggested manufacturer's list price of $1,995.<p>

All products will be available beginning in the first quarter of 1998 and are covered by the Xerox Total Satisfaction Guarantee.<p>

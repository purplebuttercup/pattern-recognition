<H3>The Photo Group</H3>
<P>The Photo Group is a direct marketer of imaging products and services that allow consumers to enjoy and share their pictures. Global brand names include <A HREF="http://www.yorkphoto.com">York</A>, <A HREF="http://www.truprint.co.uk">Truprint</A>, <A HREF="http://www.yorkexcel.co.uk">Excel</A>, Belmont and <A HREF="http://www.scotfoto.com">Scot</A>. It is our largest business with approximately $150 million in annual sales. We are the market segment leader in every country where we compete:  the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Although we are the world's largest mail order photofinisher, we have not maximized our potential.

<H3>Creating New Opportunities</H3>
<P>In the photo business, sustainable growth is a multi-step process. The first step is to build close relationships with individual customers, particularly those who demand value-added products and services. By managing the detailed information from our customer database, we are targeting specific groups with a range of services that fit their needs. We have also expanded communication channels with existing and potential customers, going beyond direct mail.
<P>Innovation is another step. New technologies, such as digital imaging and Advanced Photo System (APS) processing, increase the pace of change in our business. We are investing to capitalize on these developments.

<P>In December 1996, we introduced York FotoFloppy&#153; images on floppy disk, expanding the way photographs are used. U.S. customers can view, edit, and organize their digitized photos from a 3 1/2" floppy disk loaded onto their personal computer. This capability is the gateway for consumers to have more fun with their photos. These options include sending images by e-mail and printing them from a desktop color printer.

<P>To increase our competitiveness, we have long-standing relationships with industry leaders, such as Fuji, Kodak and Agfa. For example, we recently announced the US launch of  a new premium mail order photofinishing service under the Fuji direct brand. In addition, we have entered into arrangements with software companies to jointly market and develop digital imaging services for consumers and businesses. 

<P>Innovation goes hand-in-hand with providing added value and convenience. Mail order and the Internet are becoming more important for today's busy consumer who wants to take care of photo needs from home.

<P>York Photo has an interactive Internet site at: <A HREF="http://www.yorkphoto.com">www.yorkphoto.com</A>. Customers can get photography tips, ask questions and receive information, order products and services, and chat with other people about photography. They will soon be able to view and download their photos as well as electronically order photo merchandise from the website. This is part of our plan to strengthen the York Photo image as a value-added, contemporary and technically savvy brand.
<P>Underlying each step is outstanding implementation. We are committed to providing exceptional photo services - such as excellent print quality, rapid turnaround time, a high level of convenience and numerous processing options - and differentiating ourselves from the competition. In Great Britain, for example, we are test marketing expedited film processing for our Truprint and York brands. Customers have responded enthusiastically to our ability to deliver overnight service.

<P>In the past, we were known as a mail order photofinisher. Today, we are becoming direct marketers of imaging products and services. Building and keeping a loyal customer base requires more than just delivering prints through the mail. It means creating personal customer relationships and providing choices, value, innovative products and high-quality service.

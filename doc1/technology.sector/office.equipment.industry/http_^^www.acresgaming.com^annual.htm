<TD WIDTH="448" VALIGN="TOP"><P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">The Power of Bonusing&#153;
is what distinguishes Acres Gaming as an industry leader. The core philosophy
behind our bonusing systems and other key products is that, &quot;success
trickles up.&quot; By starting every development effort with keen insight
into why people gamble, we&#146;re able to design cost-effective systems
that enhance casinos&#146; competitiveness and profitability in ways that
are attractive, entertaining and fun for players.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">1997 proved that success
doesn&#146;t just trickle, it floods. It was a rewarding year for our shareholders,
our customers and for players at casinos from coast to coast and around
the globe.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">Net revenue increased almost
200 percent in 1997, from just under $7 million last year to more than $20
million. Profitability leapt from the loss column, with net income rising
to $1.8 million from a net loss of $1.6 million in 1996. The Company is
positioned with the necessary resources for ongoing research and development
to sustain the company&#146;s growth and success. The year ends with a strong
balance sheet that shows substantial working capital and no long-term debt.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">Final delivery and installation
of an Acres Bonusing System&#153; (&quot;ABS&quot;) customized for the Crown
Casino in Melbourne, Australia, was the capstone of our efforts in 1997.
In addition to generating considerable revenue, the Crown installation enhanced
our reputation and further confirms the effectiveness of The Power of Bonusing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">The future looks even better.
Negotiation of our strategic alliance with International Game Technology
(&quot;IGT&quot;) &#150; the world&#146;s largest slot machine manufacturer
&#150; was completed in January, 1997. This alliance allows the Company
to focus resources on further development of our bonusing technology &#150;
our greatest potential for increasing revenue.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">We appreciate your support,
and remain dedicated to putting the Power of Bonusing to work for shareholders
and casinos, by continuing to develop products that attract, entertain and
retain players.</FONT></P>

<P>Timely news delivered quickly in electronic form is a critical resource
in today's business. But sifting through the flood of information can be
a daunting task. Even with both automatic and manual profiling, the real-time
routing of news to users is often out of control. The problems are all too
familiar.<BR>
<BR>
Profiles for screening news are hard to set up and hard to calibrate to
get an acceptable balance between not missing anything and not having to
look at everything. 
<UL>
<LI>There is no easy way of determining whether a profile is still current
with respect to the changing content of news. 
<LI>Profiles can cover only anticipated news events; they are no help in
catching completely unexpected news. 
<LI>Duplicates get through, costing the recipients both time and money.
<LI>Automatic tagging of information in news items can be chancy, but having
people do this is too slow and too expensive. 
</UL>
<BR>
If you don't want to become roadkill on the Information Superhighway, you
need to monitor and control your critical information resources with a tool
that:
<UL>
<LI>Handles high volumes of text information reliably and in real time.
<LI>Is simple enough for non-technical people to use and manage. 
<LI>Performs constant quality control in real time with a full range of
tools for monitoring and inspecting the routing and sorting process. 
<LI>Adds value to every news item processed. 
</UL>
<BR>
HAWKEYE is an automated tool that analyzes and classifies text information
from electronic message streams. It is set apart from other text information
products because it operates in real time, handling high volumes of dynamic
data with unknown characteristics.<BR>
<BR>
It employs technology unlike that of conventional text retrieval systems,
which typically handle static archived data. HAWKEYE reads message files
from an input source, checks for duplicates, classifies them by context,
extracts names and other indexing terms, looks for natural groupings in
the messages, maintains a moving window on the messages for review, and
writes out messages with routing tags to an output directory. <BR>
<BR>
It also checks constantly on its own operation so that it can automatically
warn you of unexpected conditions.

FEATURES</H4>
HAWKEYE provides these unique features:
<UL>
<LI>Easy formulation of profiles from examples 
<LI>Logical hierarchies of positive and negative profiles 
<LI>Reliable, statistically based thresholds for matching 
<LI>Complete real-time event logging 
<LI>Detection of duplicates and near duplicate messages 
<LI>Statistical process control on matching with immediate alarms 
<LI>Automatic name extraction and lookup 
<LI>Post-processing content analysis and review 
<LI>Drag and drop graphical user interface 
</UL>
<H4>SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY IN A SYSTEM THAT'S EASY TO 
USE</H4>
HAWKEYE uses a technology based on N-Grams, which are simply word fragments
from two to four characters long. Messages containing similar N-Grams will
be related in content. N-Grams are unique among document indexing technologies in that they 
can be validated rigorously through controlled experiments with all kinds
of text data. <BR>
<BR>
For each message it processes, HAWKEYE computes a vector of its N-Gram frequencies
as a statistical description. HAWKEYE then creates a profile by assigning
numerical weights of importance to selected N-Grams. The match of a profile
with a message can be measured by adding the products of the frequencies
of message N-Grams times their profile weights.<BR>
<BR>
You can build a profile simply by selecting a sample of the kind of text
you want to match. HAWKEYE's unique method of setting match thresholds for
profiles is always consistent and easy to understand. Unlike other profiling
systems, the match thresholds are not arbitrary numbers you have to set
by trial and error.<BR>
<BR>
You can observe and direct the operation of HAWKEYE from a &quot;drag-and-
drop&quot;
graphical interface requiring little keyboard entry. HAWKEYE avoids &quot;queries&quot;
in the usual sense. Instead, you produce statistical profiles of target
information simply by providing examples of what to look for in incoming
data. <BR><p>

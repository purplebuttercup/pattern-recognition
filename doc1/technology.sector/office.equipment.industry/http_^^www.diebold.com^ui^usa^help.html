<h1>Help for simple search</h1>
<BODY>
The simple text search allows you to search for information using search words, modifiers, and operators. When you enter a word as a query, a simple text parser will add some simple modifiers to the word and pass everything to the search engine. You can also use traditional search operators such as AND, OR, and NOT. Results are measured by documents scores; the higher the score, the more likely the document will match the specified search criteria.

You can specify the following criteria in the simple search screen:
<ul>
<li><B>Subject</B>: Select one collection from the drop-down list to include in your search. A collection represents a list of documents currently available for you to search. 
<p>
<li><B>Search for</B>:  Type a word or phrase in this field to represent the text you want to search for in the collection you previously selected. Follow these rules for specifying your search text:
<p>
To search for multiple words, separate each word with a space.  For example, if you specify <i>time manage</i>, simple search will return all documents that contain the words <i>time</i> or <i>manage</i>. Additionally, it will return all documents that contain variations of these words, such as <i>timely</i> and <i>management</i>.
</ul>
</ul>

Example</B><BR>

To search for the words Monterey and otter in collection X, follow these steps: 
<ol>
<li>Select collection X from the <b>Subject drop-down</b> list.
<li>Enter the following in the <b>Search for</b> field:
<pre>Monterey otter</pre>
<li>Click <b>Search</b>. If any documents contain the words Monterey or otter (or variations of these words), a list with all the documents will appear.

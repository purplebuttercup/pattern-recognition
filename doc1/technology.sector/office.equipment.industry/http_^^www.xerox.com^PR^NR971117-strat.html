<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>XEROX CROSSES 'THE GREAT DIGITAL DIVIDE'<BR>
WITH DIGITAL OFFICE STRATEGY<BR>
<i>"Xerox delivers more than digital, we deliver
simplicity"</i></H2>

COMDEX, LAS VEGAS, November 17, 1997--Xerox Corporation, building on a succession of digital and color capabilities introduced this year, today articulated a digital office strategy that uniquely positions the company to win an inevitable clash for leadership in the digital workplace.<p>

In a briefing today at COMDEX, the world's largest computer convocation, Xerox demonstrated capabilities that transform its Document Centre Digital Copier into the most efficient network scanner and printer available for the mainstream office, and advanced the company's vision for the document-focused, knowledge-based enterprise.<p>

"Today we cross the Great Digital Divide, rounding out capabilities that provide our customers with the ultimate power--the power of choice," said Paul A. Allaire, Xerox chairman and chief executive officer. "Xerox delivers more than digital, we deliver simplicity, networked products every bit as intuitive as a traditional copier."<p>

With its document-focused approach to the digital office, Xerox has assembled a complete line of high-speed network printers, color systems, digital copiers, modular multifunction devices, desktop products and services--with the software "glue" that enables a smooth flow of documents across paper and digital worlds--allowing customers to simplify their growth to the network.<p>

"No other company so effectively sits astride the digital and paper worlds because no other company is as focused on the document, where the knowledge of an organization resides," said Rick Thoman, Xerox president and chief operating officer.  "That defines our digital strategy, our digital opportunity and our digital advantage."<p>

Digital products currently account for more than 35 percent of the company's revenues, growing at an annual rate of 25 percent; color product revenue has grown at an annualized rate of nearly 50 percent. The growth has been attributed to leadership technology, aggressive pricing, far-reaching partnerships, and a focus on the fastest-growing segments of the market.<p>

The company used Comdex as a forum to display A Different Xerox -- a world that is digital, colorful and network connected; embodied in an elaborate booth display connected by the theme:  "Generation Xerox.  Xtremely Smart.  Xtremely Simple.  Get with IT."	The company's breadth of capabilities came together for public display at COMDEX, including:<p>

The announcement of network scanning and printing capabilities for the Document Centre, transforming the fast-selling digital copier into the industry's most advanced multifunction office system--the first that delivers network scanning to the mainstream office with the ease, reliability and automation of pushing a telephone "re-dial" button.<p>

Price reductions of up to 24 percent on the 17-page-per-minute DocuPrint 4517 and 4517MP, making the two network laser printers the most affordable models in their class.  With expected street prices starting at $975 and running costs of about one penny per page, the 4517 offers a lower total cost of ownership then the new 17-ppm HP Laser Jet 4000 printers.<p>

A 20 percent price reduction (new estimated street price of $399) for the Document HomeCentre, a multifunction device with a full-color scanner, color inkjet printer/copier and Pagis Pro image-management software that converts the family PC into a project creativity center.<p>

The first public showing and commercial availability of the DocuPrint N32 network printer, which is 30 percent faster, less expensive and more feature-rich than HP's flagship LaserJet 5Si network printer.<p>
A display of Xerox-branded toner cartridges for HP laser printers, which deliver Xerox quality and reliability to HP printer customers, at a lower cost than comparable HP-branded products.<p>

dpiX, a spin-off company based on technology developed at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) showed off a newly introduced, ultra-high resolution, 19-inch flat-panel liquid crystal display, the largest panel of its kind manufactured in North America.<p>

The recently announced Xerox DocuColor 5799 copier/printer, which raises the benchmark for high-fidelity color imaging in graphics-intensive environments.<p>

The C55 Color Laser Printer which, when introduced earlier this year, redefined the price and performance formula for laser-quality, full-color desktop printing.<p>

<H2>New Low Power, High Bandwidth Differential Twisted Pair Drivers From élantec 
Minimize Distortion In Twisted Pair, ADSL/HDSL Transmission</H2>

<P><B>MILPITAS, Calif., November 30, 1995</B> -- A pair of new, low-power, high-bandwidth 
transmission op amps designed to drive signals down twisted pair lines with 
minimal distortion are now available in sample quantities from <B>élantec 
Semiconductor, Inc. <I>(NASDAQ: ELNT)</I></B>.
  
<P><B>&Eacutelantec</B>'s new <B>EL2140</B> and <B>EL2141</B> differential twisted 
pair drivers provide 150 MHz 3dB bandwidth and consume as little as 11 mA while 
delivering an output current of at least 50 mA for short-distance signaling in 
applications such as twisted pair line drivers, differential line drivers, and in 
VGA over twisted pair.  The low power consumption and high output current 
specifications provide optimal price and performance for these applications; 
competing differential pair drivers generally consume more than 35 mA of 
quiescent current, according to Ralph Granchelli, vice president of marketing.   

<P>The new drivers also can be used in any line driving application where common 
mode injection is likely, and they are ideal for transmission of ADSL/HDSL, which 
requires very low distortion amplification.  The input signal can be in either 
single-ended or differential form. Output is always in differential form. 

<P>Differential input range for the two new drivers is &#177 2.3V, and basic slew 
rate is 800 V/&#181 s.  Minimum output current is 50mA. Both ICs operate 
on &#177 5V supplies or single supply.

<H3>EL2140/41 Provide Low Current, High Bandwidth For Driving Twisted Pair Lines</H3>

</CENTER>

<P>Output common mode level is set by the reference pin, which has a 3dB bandwidth 
greater than 100 MHz.  The reference pin is generally grounded but can be tied to 
any voltage reference. The <B>EL2140</B> comes with a fixed gain of 2; on the 
<B>EL2141</B>, two feedback inputs allow the user to set the device gain.  

<P>"The <B>EL2140</B> and <B>EL2141</B> drive twisted pair signals at higher 
bandwidths with lower power consumption than any competing drivers, which makes 
them price/performance leaders for short distance computer-to-computer or 
computer-to-peripheral applications," said Granchelli.  "Our design team has 
developed them specifically to provide reduced distortion when transmitting 
ADSL/HDSL signals, and to be flexible enough so users can adjust the gain if they 
want to boost the power applied."  

<P>Granchelli added that the new drivers also supply a lower-end complement to 
<B>élantec Semiconductor's EL1501 Subscriber Line Interface (SLIDE)</B> 
family of op amps, which were introduced earlier this year.
 
<P>The <B>EL2140</B> and <B>EL2141</B> are available now in 8-pin SOICs, and pricing 
begins at $2.79.

<p>A major construction site in Hong Kong has implemented a
contactless smart card system for their entire operation. The
cashless site accepts smart cards as the only form of access by
employees as well as payment for food at cafeterias, vending
machines, and room rental fees. The card is loaded with the
employee's weekly pay, and has an additional purse for the user's
own cash. This system has cut down a tremendous amount of
paperwork and cash handling, enabling a streamlined payroll
procedure and the ability to serve over 8,000 meals hourly. Even
more important: all other types of cards and cash failed to
perform in this very harsh, demanding environment. </p>

<p>A <a name="bus">bus</a> system in the Los Angeles area
collects fares with a Racom Systems, Inc. contactless smart card
system. Passengers purchase smart cards loaded with bus fare, and
as they board the bus, the card is waived over the controller.
This system has cut bus dwell time considerably because passenger
boarding is more efficient. In addition, passengers and drivers
no longer have to carry cash, and therefore the threat of purse,
wallet, and driver robbery is eliminated.</p>

<p>A parking facility in <a name="Lubbock">Lubbock</a>, Texas,
issues Racom Systems, Inc. contactless smart cards to its
customers for access into the parking area and for fee
collection. The Racom system allows customers to enter the
facility by presenting the card at the gate. Upon leaving, the
customer again presents the card where it is debited the parking
fee or fees are accrued to the customer's account for monthly
billing. This system has brought the parking facility real-time
user demographics, lowered overhead costs, and significantly
decreased waiting times at the parking gates for fee collection. </p>

<p><a name="Ticketless">Ticketless </a>travel is a fast growing
approach to streamlined airline ticketing, check-in and boarding
procedures. A Racom smart card used in this application offers
improved service and competitiveness to the airline, while it
reduces queues and speeds up the boarding process for its
customers. A smart card can hold all of a passenger's flight
information as well as ticket number, seat selection and check-in
and boarding status. The passenger can use the smart card at a
check-in kiosk at their convenience, pick up a ticket ordered
over the phone, or via a PC, or purchase a ticket at the kiosk.
Customers can also confirm their flight, select their seat,
check-in and board with the card.&nbsp;Lastly, the use of a smart
card reduces the risk of lost tickets, tracks passengers and
their baggage, and reduces the risk of lost luggage.&nbsp; </p>

<p>A smart card approach to airline ticketing offer airlines new
marketing opportunities. Loyalty programs, such as frequent flier
clubs, increase market presence and visibility and can be tied to
other promotions that include clubs and services. Co-marketing
opportunities between the banking community and the airline
industry can also create shared cost for promotions. In addition,
the extra smart card purses can be used for related tie-ins with
other business associated with the airline industry. These
approaches generate great savings for the airline because they
reduce staffing requirements, ticketing costs, and ticket and
counterfeiting.</p>

<p><a name="Wherever ">Wherever </a>machine readable and
writeable data must stay with equipment, inventory, work in
process, facilities, or almost any object, the solution is Racom
LFM Industrial Tags. The tag, with Racom's RF interface and FRAM
memory, can be written with information about contents, time,
personnel, instructions, repair or any other kinds of data. Tag
data can be easily updated with a controller connected to a local
workstation or mainframe. If employees carry an ID with Racom
smart card technology, the controller can read personnel
information from the ID and write it into the tag as an automated
record of access. The applications continue... </p>

<p><b>Facilities/Equipment Management</b> </p>

<p>Maintenance of equipment frequently requires information such
as PM instructions that must be available on site. With Racom's
smart card technology, this information can be stored on the
equipment, updated from a portable controller, and records can be
automatically updated on the tag. As needed, the central database
can also be updated with records from the portable controller.
Where record-keeping is crucial, the automation of this system
eliminates errors inherent in manual record keeping. </p>

<p><b>Industrial Automation</b> </p>

<p>Moving information, such as customer maintenance and repair
data, and work-in-process, from a central database to an actual
item, significantly reduces time and database complexity.
Manufacturing instructions and records on a Racom contactless
smart card can move with the work in process for automation.
Warranty and service information can be stored and updated on the
item in a form easily accessible to approved personnel. In the
manufacturing process, status, personnel, and product changes can
be kept on the product in a machine interactive format without
burdening a central database. </p>

<p><b>Warehouse Inventory</b> </p>

<p>Distributing data on bins, palettes, or individual products
improves efficiency and simplifies database management. Personnel
badge information is easily written into Racom tags, and then
placed on bins or products for accurate record keeping. Product
movement between sites or out of the range of the central
database can still be easily tracked and automated. </p>

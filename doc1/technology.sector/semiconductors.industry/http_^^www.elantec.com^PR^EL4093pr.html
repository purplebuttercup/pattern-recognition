<P><B>MILPITAS, Calif., Nov. 30, 1995</B> -- <B>élantec Semiconductor, Inc., 
<I>(NASDAQ:ELNT)</I></B> today expanded its family of DC restore video 
amplifiers with the introduction of the <B>EL4093</B>, a complete 
DC-restored video amplifier subsystem designed for a broad range 
of video equipment and multimedia PC cards. 

<P>Now available in samples, the <B>EL4093</B> contains a current feedback 
amplifier and a sample and hold amp designed to stabilize video 
performance, featuring a very fast enable and low leakage. The 
device provides a 300 MHz bandwidth and 1500V/&#181 s slew rate 
using a low typical supply currentof 9.5 mA.  Differential 
gain is 0.04%; differential phase is 0.02&#176 into 150
ohms for NTSC-compatible systems. The <B>EL4093</B> runs on &#177 5V power 
supplies.  

<P>The sample-and-hold amp contains a current output stage that 
simplifies its connection to the video amp.  Its high output 
impedance also helps preserve video linearity at low supply voltages.  

<P>The new <B>EL4093</B> is ideal for video mixing equipment, video descramblers,
and multimedia cards for PCs, according to Ralph Granchelli, Vice 
President of Marketing.  It also provides the level of performance 
required for new studio equipment now being developed for high definition television 
(HDTV), and for the new generation of super video graphics adapter 
cards now being manufactured.

<P>"The <B>EL4093</B> provides excellent overall performance at 5 Volts," Granchelli 
said.  "Demand for this type of DC restore amplifier has been rising steadily 
since we introduced our first dedicated DC restore amplifier in 1990, and 
new applications are coming on line as designers begin or continue work on 
new studio equipment for HDTV."  
Granchelli added that <B>élantec Semiconductor</B> is at work now on a complete 
family of DC restore amps that are lower priced and have lower power requirements.

<P>The <B>EL4093</B> is available now in 16-pin plastic DIP samples for $7.45 each.

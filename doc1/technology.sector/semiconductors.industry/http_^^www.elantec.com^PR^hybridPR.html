<P>MILPITAS, California, July 1, 1997  <B>--</B> Elantec Semiconductor, Inc. today announced that as of July 1, 1997 their entire military and commercial hybrid product line would be discontinued.</P>

<P>"Elantec originally started as a military hybrid manufacturer", said Ralph Granchelli, vice president of marketing. "With the military downsizing and the phasing out of older military programs, it is no longer feasible to continue manufacturing the twenty-five year old hybrid product line orginally pioneered by National Semiconductor."</P>

<P>Over the last fourteen years Elantec has established a significant customer base and a long term working relationship with these customers.  In an effort to support our customers, Elantec has signed an End of Life agreement with Zeus Electronics, an Arrow Company, to provide long term and continued support of Military Hybrid products to our customers.</P>

<P>After July 1, 1997 Elantec will not accept direct military hybrid orders, except from a few remaining print customers that require special processing. All other orders will be referred to Zeus Electronics, who will stock these products.
The following products are effected:</P>

booth at COMDEX, being held from November 17 through 21, will emphasize
the company's aggressive move into the multimedia arena, with products ranging
from PCI audio chips to 3D notebook graphics devices, DVD playback capabilities
and home entertainment demonstrations.  <BR>
New Audio Capability: <BR>
The company has recently launched a major initiative in the $700 million
audio market with the introduction of the 9753WAVE&#153; and the 4DWAVE-DX
audio PCI devices. Trident's audio lineup has already won critical acclaim
from industry leaders and market experts. The 9753WAVE for the first time
combines PCI audio capability with an advanced graphics accelerator on a
single chip. The new device, which creates high-performance PCI audio at
the price of low-performance ISA audio, is aimed at the sub-$1000 PC market.<BR>
The 4DWAVE-DX, a single-purpose audio device, provides 64 voices with advanced
sound effects, digital joystick and enhanced audio capabilities such as
3D positional sound.<BR>
Portable Devices:<BR>
Trident derives more than 40% of its revenues from the portable market.
 The COMDEX booth will exhibit a number of notebook computers that are already
using<BR>
Trident's advanced 3D-enabled Cyber9397&#153; chips, such as the IBM ThinkPad
770, the Fujitsu LifeBook, the Power Computing PowerTrip and Twinhead's
latest notebook model. The company will demonstrate its first embedded graphics
accelerator, the Cyber9388&#153;, with 2MB of SDRAM. Trident just announced
the world's first embedded 3D notebook chip, the Cyber9520&#153; flat-panel
controller, for AGP and PCI systems. <BR>
Multimedia Desktop:<BR>

<TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN="TOP"><P><FONT COLOR="#00ff00" SIZE=+1>Trident's transition from a graphics accelerator
vendor to a full-fledged multimedia solutions provider is also evident in
the desktop area with the presentation of the 3DIm&agrave;ge 985&#153;,
the 3DIm&agrave;ge 975DVD&#153;, and the 3DIm&agrave;ge 975&#153;.  The
3DIm&agrave;ge 975&#153; powers the graphics in Philips' new DVX8000 world-class
home entertainment module that will serve as the core for this year's Trident
multimedia presentation. Philips was specifically interested in the high-quality
videographics that the 3DIm&agrave;ge 975&#153; provides.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00ff00" SIZE=+1>The 3DIm&agrave;ge 985&#153; features full-blown
AGP on a fully-functional 3D graphics accelerator.  Trident has a proven
track record in supplying the full-line of AGP solutions. One of the first
to maximize the advantages that Intel's new graphics port can offer, the
3DIm&agrave;ge 985&#153; can pump out up to 85 frames per second.  The 3DIm&agrave;ge
975DVD&#153; is another Trident solution for satisfying customers' demands
for DVD content.<BR>

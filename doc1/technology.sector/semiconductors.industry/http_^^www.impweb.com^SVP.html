The companyoperates a Class 10 wafer fabrication plant in San Jose, California.  Processesavailable today include single and double-poly, CMOS, BiCMOS and EEPROMtechnologies.  They are being used to produce devices ranging from electricallyprogrammable analog circuits, filters and read channels for mass storageperipherals, to modems and network interface products. </P><P>Silicon Venture Partners is a program established by IMP to providepreferential access to wafer fabrication capabilities and favorable financialterms to fabless semiconductor start-up companies.  This minimizes the time andeffort required to secure funds and locate a silicon supplier during thecritical proof-of-concept phase of a new product idea.  The Silicon VenturePartners program allows entrepreneurs to focus their energies on their corecompetencies of defining new architectures, testing new circuit techniques andcreating unique software solutions, rather than on negotiating the details ofcomplex business transactions. </P><P>Under the SVP program, IMP will absorb many of the start-up expenses ofdeveloping and manufacturing a new integrated circuit in exchange for a share offuture profits or other compensation.  There are no rigid guidelines for asuccessful partnership.  To meet the widely varying needs of different businessopportunities, IMP is flexible in its approach to each situation.  Arelationship is considered on its unique merits and an appropriate structure iscreated. </P><P>The IMP facility is located in the heart of Silicon Valley; on North FirstStreet, in San Jose.  This puts us in the same time zone and mind set as many ofour customers.  You have access to the engineers who will create, verify andprocess your mask set.  You can speak directly to them to take decisions andresolve problems in real time.  This eliminates the critical time-zone anddistance barriers associated with working with off-shore wafer suppliers. </P><P>You can design the product database yourself in accordance with IMP suppliedstandard process design rules.  Or, if you prefer, you can work with athird-party design house.  You may purchase products in any form; as wafers oras finished packaged and tested units.  IMP's role is to complement yourin-house capability. </P><P>IMP has relationships with world-class trading partners in the NorthAmerican, European and Asian/Pacific markets.  For those entrepreneurs whoprefer to focus their efforts on products and intellectual property, we canprovide access to these world-wide channels of distribution, in addition to ourtraditional wafer fabrication and manufacturing services. </P><CENTER><H3>If you are interested in discussing the Silicon Venture Partners program,contact David Gillooly at IMP, today!

Standard analog and mixed-signal capabilities includelow (3V) and high voltage (12/15/100V) processes, fusible link technology,EPROM/EEPROM modules, high resistivity poly and double poly process options.IMP also has volume manufacturing expertise in processes above 500 Volts.</P><P>A particular strength of IMP is the ability to rapidly port a customer'sexisting process into the volume production facility. </P><P>IMP participates in five business areas: </P><P><UL>  <LI><B>Database Production </B>Customer products designed for standard  IMP processes and design rules.   <LI><B>Process Porting</B> Customer developed wafer manufacturing processes  are installed in IMP facilities.   <LI><B>Process Development</B> Major modification to an existing IMP process  to meet specific customer requirements.   <LI><B>ASIC Design Assistance Projects</B> which IMP takes an active role  in the product circuit design and/or layout.   <LI> Silicon Venture Partner Project partnerships with fabless start-ups.  </UL></P><P>IMP will supply customers with wafers, die or finished packaged and testeddevices. </P><H3>Domestic Wafer Fabrication Facility </H3><P>IMP operates an ISO 9001 registered, 16,000 sq. ft. facility in San Jose, CA, with an 8,000sq. ft. class 10 clean room. Wafer capacity is 15,000, 5&quot; wafers startsper month. Offshore foundry partners with licensed IMP processes are availableto insure security of supply. </P><P>With a USA based location, domestic customers receive same-day, real-timeanswers to technical and delivery queries. Compared to Pacific Rim and Europeanfoundries, communication with IMP is easy, faster and more economical. Afast, effective communication channel is an often overlooked key factorin selecting a foundry partner. </P><H3>Flexibility </H3><P>Tight design rules and a staff of experienced process technologists allowIMP to accommodate almost any customer requirement. Unlike many foundrieswith rigid &quot;canned&quot; options, IMP actively encourages partnerswith new or modified process requirements. An existing process can be portedto IMP's facility when volume warrants. </P><P>IMP will supply wafers, die or provide a complete turn key solution </P><H3>IMP Custom Silicon Support Teams </H3><P>To meet the rapidly changing needs of our customers, we provide a highlyflexible and responsive service. To that end, our engineering staff worksclosely with you from the difficult phase of prototyping through to fullcircuit production. </P><P>Our silicon foundry operation centers around technical account managers,dedicated production planning administrators, and process and circuit designersoperating as a consulting team for the customer. </P><P>Experienced in the design, fabrication, packaging and testing of digital,analog, and mixed-signal integrated circuits, these experts are availableat any time to meet with your technical and business staff to assist indelivering high quality prototype and production wafers to your scheduleand at the highest quality levels. The staff will work with foundry partnersto enhance yield and advise on changes that will improve manufacturability.</P><P> Our commitment to this level of customer support is because we recognizeits importance in achieving timely product introductions in highly competitivemarkets. </P><H3>Design Inputs </H3><P>The IMP wafer foundry accepts customer database designs in GDS II formatand PG tapes. If required engineering support is available to convert yourtooling from an existing foundry to IMP standards. IMP provides all thedesign rules and electrical parameters needed to modify new designs. </P><H3>Test Capability </H3><P>IMP offers a full range of test capability for digital, analog and mixed-signalproducts. Precision analog and high speed mixed-signal capability is available.IMP has in-house test capability for both digital and analog tests usingTrillium, Sentry 20/21, LTX77/Synchro, MCT and other testers. PackagingIMP recognizes time-to-market is a critical customer concern and that fastturnaround prototypes are a key element in reducing a foundry partner'stime-to-market. IMP operates an in-house prototype packaging service forfast response. High-volume production packaging services are provided byIMP qualified assembly vendors.</P><H3>Delivering Quality </H3><P>IMP facilities are certified to ISO 9001, 1994 Edition. In 1996, IMP received dual certification by the National Standards Institute Registration Board  (RAB) in the U.S. and by the Dutch Council for Accredidation (RVA) in Europe. </P><P>IMP uses statistical process control for real time monitoring of allsilicon manufacturing operations. Over 180 control charts are maintainedon-line. Cp and Cpk trends are maintained on critical parameters such as:gate oxide thickness, poly sheet resistance, poly width, diffusion width,field oxide thickness, intermetal oxide thickness, threshold voltages, breakdownvoltages and transistor gains. Device parameters are collected on all processes.The result is exceptional quality. </P><P>Many leading companies have selected IMP as their manufacturing partner:</P><P><UL>  <LI> Adaptec   <LI> Apple Computer   <LI>Conner Archive   <LI>Hewlett Packard   <LI>International Rectifier   <LI> Iomega   <LI> Level One   <LI>Rockwell International   <LI> Siemens   <LI> Tektronix   <LI> TEMIC </UL></P><H3>Turnkey Solutions </H3><P>Customers with turn-key requirements are served with IMP's production-proventest facility, quick-turn in-house packaging capability and off-shore volumepackaging resources. </P><P>Packaged devices can be drop shipped to customers anywhere in the world.</P><H3>Intellectual Property Security</H3><P>All customer designs and tooling are held in the strictest confidence.</P><H3>Silicon Venture Partners </H3><P>Start-up, fabless semiconductor firms are welcome. IMP initiated the<A HREF="SVP.html">Silicon Venture Partners (SVP)</A> program to provide preferential access towafer fabrication capabilities. IMP will assist fabless start-up companiesby sharing development costs in exchange for a share of future profits orother compensation. Each relationship is considered on its unique meritsand an appropriate structure created.</P><P> In addition, entrepreneurs who prefer to focus on product and applicationdevelopment can access IMP's marketing and sales distribution channel thatcovers the North American, European and Asia/Pacific markets. </P><H3>Your Next Step </H3><P>The IMP team approach to silicon foundry services is your path to satisfaction.Whether you have your own design resource and facility, want to utilizeoutside third-party design expertise, want to port an existing process orneed a process designed to your specification or are simply seeking a secondsource, IMP is the foundry to provide you with cost-effective and timelysilicon solutions. </P><HR><P><A HREF="procstbl.html">IMP Standard Process Capabilities Table, ProcessTechnology Summary</A></P><P><A HREF="SVP.html">Silicon Venture Partners Program </A></P><P>IMP is an Associate Member of the <A HREF="http://www.fsa.org">FablessSemiconductor Association</A>.</P><P><HR ALIGN=LEFT SIZE="5"></P></P><P>For further information about the company:</P><P><A HREF="Profile.html">About IMP, Inc.</A> * <A HREF="litavail.html">Product Literature</A>  * <A HREF="news.html">Press Releases</A>   *<A HREF="FINANDX.html">Financial News</A>  * <A HREF="INVESTOR/RELDX.html"> Investor Relations</A> <BR> *   <A HREF="JOBS.html">Job opportunities</A>   * <A HREF="home.html">IMP Home Page</A>   * <A HREF="Contact.html">IMP Contact Information</A>  * <A HREF="Contact.html">Representatives and Distributors</A></P><P> <IMG SRC = "IMPLOGOTR.gif" ALT="IMP, Inc." ></P><H5>The IMPlogo is a registered trademark of IMP, Inc.

<p>Contactless &quot;smart card&quot; technology is designed for
applications in which continuous movement is an integral part of
the transaction. The number of potential applications for smart
card technology is astounding. The following list indicates
applications where smart cards are currently being used and the
related industries: <a href="smrt_crd.htm">Automatic fare
collection </a>(AFC) for public transport (including bus systems,
subways, taxi and limousine services), <a href="smrt_crd.htm">Access
Control </a>for public/government offices, parking lots, ski
resorts, special conferences/trade shows, <a href="smrt_crd.htm">Ticketless
Travel </a>for airlines, <a href="smrt_crd.htm">Customer Loyalty</a>
for oil and gas retail, general retail, restaurants, long
distance telephone service, supermarkets, credit cards, travel
services, and <a href="smrt_crd.htm">Electronic Purse</a> for
cruise ships, colleges, universities and schools. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="7rl.gif" width="525" height="8"> </p>

<p><img src="3abulbl.gif" width="9" height="9"><a name="uses"><b><i>I
</i></b></a><b><i>know there are cards being sold in the US, but
there aren't any uses for them yet, are there?</i></b> </p>

<p>Why, yes! Although most of the market for smart cards is
currently in Europe, Racom alone has installed numerous smart
card systems in the US. These include an airport parking access
control/AFC system in Lubbock, Texas, an AFC system for the
Winston-Salem Transit Authority in North Carolina, an AFC system
for Camarillo Area Transit, Ojai transit, Moorpark City Transit,
Simi Valley Transit, South Coast Area Transit, Thousand Oaks
Transit and VISTA - all located in Southern California, and an
access control system for the certain employees of the Chicago
Transit Authority (CTA). </p>

<p><i>Racom is currently planning additional installations for
1996 in the US &nbsp;for </i><a href="smrt_crd.htm"><i>AFC,
Access Control and Electronic Purse.</i></a> </p>

Ticketless Travel? MultiApps?</i></b> </p>

<p>AFC means <a href="smrt_crd.htm">automatic fare collection </a>-
a major application for smart cards today. AFC can be applied to
various industries including bus, subway or other transit
systems, taxicabs and limousine services, even non-stop toll
booths. Using smart card technology in AFC applications is smart
because it increases load/unload time because the users don't
have to look for change, it decreases costs because the users can
use the same card over and over - it isn't simply disposed of
once its value has been used. Smart card technology also allows
for inter-system transfer - no more of those little transfer
slips to make sure you don't lose! Could you imagine having one
card that would allow you to get on a bus at home, ride to a
train stop, transfer to the train, ride to work and then ride
home with your spouse or friend in a car and use your &quot;smart
card&quot; to drive in the carpool lane? </p>

<p>EPOS means &quot;Electronic Point of Sale&quot; and is geared
towards the retail industry. Electronic purse, as defined in a
March 1995 Press Release for Schlumberger, a French smart card
manufacturer, is a highly convenient replacement for coins and
small value notes. The Press Release announced that &quot;First
Union chooses Schlumberger smart cards for USA's first large
scale 'electronic purse' scheme.&quot; First Union, a top US
banking and financial services company, plans to issue a million
stored value smart cards in Atlanta between September 1995 and
the start of the Olympics in 1996. This specific installation
included both disposable and rechargeable stored value cards
issued in denominations of $25 to $100. Additional value will be
added via ATM's or telephones. </p>

<p><a href="smrt_crd.htm">Access Control </a>does not only refer
to physical access control to buildings or parking lots, but also
refers to the encryption and authorization capabilties of smart
card technology to limit access to public networks and
information networks. A good example of this is the cable
television industry. </p>

<p><a href="smrt_crd.htm">Ticketless Travel </a>is just that -
traveling without a paper ticket. In this type of system high
frequency travelers are issued personalized smart cards. The
card's interior computer chip maintains the necessary data needed
for travel - reservation information, Frequent Flyer information
and the method of payment (e.g. credit card number or prepaid
balance). Each traveler may go directly to an airline gate, most
likely insert the card into a card reader (like an ATM), select a
row and available seat, then board the aircraft with the
necessary charge and frequent flyer information read from and
stored to his/her card automatically. Racom is currently working
on a project with American Airlines for Ticketless travel. </p>

<p><a href="smrt_crd.htm">Multi-Applications</a> represent a new
generation of smart cards. This highly evolved card will
effectively combine the applications discussed above with the
additional capability to keep the various applications
effectively separated from each other. In a recent &quot;Smart
Card Technology International&quot; article, Stephen Lee stated
that &quot;it is envisaged that such a card will act as a
'personal proxy' for the individual in the Information Age. The
card will allow the consumer to pay securely, to gain access to
electronic services, for personal identification and to customise
his interaction with the network. The card will provide consumer
choice and be flexible to change as his or her lifestyle
changes.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="3abulbl.gif" width="9" height="9"><a name="where"><b><i>Where
</i></b></a><b><i>are smart cards being used now?</i></b> </p>

<p>Smart cards are being used all over the world. Basic
statistics tell the story. Germany has issued over 80 million
smart cards to its citizens in conjunction their national health
care program. 60% of French citizens currently use smart cards.
Over 50 major cities in the World are either currently running
pilot programs or otherwise seriously evaluating introduction of
smart cards for use on their mass transit and with related
parking and other retail and service businesses. The top five
smart card producers in Europe alone distributed over 370 million
smart cards in 1994; nearly 500 million in `95.</p>

<p>The following uses were obtained from&nbsp;<a
href="http://www.cp8.bull.net/">CP8 Transac</a>, of the Bull
Groupe from the&nbsp;brochure <i>&quot;Smart Solutions for
Secured Transactions&quot;;</i> Smart cards have been used by the
Marines as a means to make purchases and cash withdrawals with
reduced manpower and costs for materials required to administer
the paper system. The US Department of Agriculture has conducted
a test for use of smart cards as a replacement for Food Stamps.
Because of the security features in smart cards, the benefits
cannot be sold or traded. Smart cards have been used in
worldwide/national Expo's/trade shows. In one instance, the cards
were used in conjunction with fingerprint data for use in access
control to the exhibition area.The Royal Bank of Canada has used
smart card technology since 1985 for access control to the bank's
on-line electronic business banking services.The US Department of
Agriculture has used smart card technology to monitor and control
crop sales. The card's memory stores crop quota and loan
information, and allows the USDA to receive accurate, timely data
about crop sales for use in price forecasting. Students, faculty
and staff at the University of Rome-Italy have used smart cards
for access control&nbsp;to student records, verification that the
&quot;real&quot; student is taking an exam, data
entry/verification in the university's mainframe computer.</p>

<p>The French public telephone company also has issued smart
cards as stored value cards to make long distance telephone
calls. This reduces or eliminates the usage of coins at pay
telephones, reducing the manpower required by the telephone
company in handling the coins and increasing the convenience for
the customers. All French bank cards now have microprocessor -
reducing the bank's communications and paper processing costs,
eliminating fraud and expediting retail check-outs.In Norway, the
Norwegian bank association is issuing smart cards to be used a
debit cards throughout the country. Club Med has replaced its
bead necklace payment system with smart cards to automate
payments at clubs in Spain, France and on cruises. In France, the
smart card is now used as the key to reception for pay TV
programs. In Switzerland, smart cards are used similarly to ATM
cards in the US. The Swiss use the cards for cash withdrawals at
ATM's and purchases at a national grocery store chain.This is
only a handful of the current applications in place, there are
many more out there and yet to come. </p>

<p>Yes, in Germany over 80 million smart cards have been issued
to its citizens in conjunction their national health care
program. These cards allow easy access to your health history and
even easier update of the information. </p>

many smart cards being used today?</i></b> </p>

<p>It's hard to say, but market research indicates that nearly
two billion cards have been issued in the past few years. The
majority have been issued in Europe, but the US and Asia are soon
to follow. </p>

name="underdeveloped"><b><i>I've </i></b></a><b><i>heard that

<p>In many countries where there is little or no
telecommunications infrastructure compared to the U.S., smart
card technology is quickly and productively solving the needs of
people to conduct transactions for personal, public and
industrial use. This is happening even though there are still
very few agreed-upon &quot;standards&quot; for generalized
worldwide use of either contact or contactless smart cards.</p>

name="differences"><b><i>are the</i></b></a> <b><i>main
differences between stored-value cards, smart cards, and debit
cards?</i></b> </p>

<p>Fundamentally, a stored-value card is usually issued in low
dollar amounts ranging from $25-$100 and is intended to replace
cash. These cards may be disposed of or reloaded with value. A
smart card has a microchip in the card and can perform
Multi-functions. In the October 30,1995 issue of
&quot;Fortune&quot; magazine, the article about American Express
stated that &quot;an MCI test card at Florida State acts as photo
ID, door key, and credit and ATM card. On a debit card purchases
are deducted directly from cardholder checking accounts. </p>

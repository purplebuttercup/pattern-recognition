<P><B>MILPITAS, Calif., Nov. 21, 1995</B> -- <B>élantec Semiconductor, Inc., 
<I>(NASDAQ: ELNT)</I></B> today announced that the company's IC manufacturing 
process has achieved <B>ISO 9001 certification</B> effective at the end of the corporate 
fiscal year, October 31. 

<P>Certification was completed in just nine months, a significantly shorter time than 
required by other IC manufacturers, in part because <B>élantec</B> has been committed to 
clear and concise documentation of its designs and manufacturing programs and to 
maintaining the highest achievable quality, according to David O'Brien, <B>élantec</B> 
President and Chief Executive Officer. 

<P>"Our commitment to high quality programs and processes and our compliance with military 
qualification standards  such as MIl-STD-1772 allowed us to meet most of the <B>ISO 9000</B> 
requirements for the past decade," said O'Brien.  "We were  well prepared for the ISO 
certification process, and have been able to achieve it rapidly and efficiently."

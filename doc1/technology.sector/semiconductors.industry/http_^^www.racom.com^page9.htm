<p><font size="3">Racom's LF Series is well suited for closed
payment systems of any size as well as access control and
industrial automation. It provides fast, dependable movement of
data concerning transactions, authorizations, or files between
people or things in motion and any kind of computer system. The
LF Series consists of controllers and transponders. Transponders
(located in the plastic card) are memory devices that are powered
and communicate via Radio Frequency signals. Controllers provide
power to the transponder and a communications channel between a
computer and transponders. Because the LF transponder is
completely sealed in a solid plastic package, it is impervious to
nearly all environmental hazards. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">In addition to products that support a wide
variety of end system applications, Racom also provides products
specially designed to support the evaluation, demonstration, and
development of custom demonstration and end systems. See the
Demonstration/Evaluation product literature for more details. We
recognize that in the rapidly evolving world of Smartcard
systems, your ability to demonstrate system concepts is crucial
to business success. LF products and the Racom support team make
developing impressive demonstration systems quick and painless
and the transition to system rollout simple.</font> </p>

<p><font size="3">Since the LF system uses Radio signals for
power and communication, performance can be degraded by nearby
noise sources such as PCs, monitors, LCDs, even water coolers.
Fortunately, this noise dissipates over short ranges (1 foot or
less) and is easily shielded. So, if your LF system is not
performing at the range you expect try moving it or shielding
noise sources with aluminum foil. Be especially wary of switching
power supplies, they tend to generate a great deal of electronic
noise.</font><font size="2"> </font></p>

<h2><font size="4">How contactless works:</font> </h2>

<p><font size="3">The host computer writes data to or reads data
from LF series cards through an LF Controller. LF Controllers are
available in many different configurations to support different
applications. All LF Controllers consist of an antenna coil and a
controller board connected by cable. The LF Controller
communicates with a host by serial interface described in the
next section.</font></p>

<h2><font size="4">Controller/Host Interface</font></h2>

<p><font size="3">The LF Controller functions as a modem between
a host computer and Racom's LF series contactless smartcards. The
Controller communicates with the host via RS-232C, RS-422, or
CMOS level serial at 9600, 19200, or 38400 bits per second. The
bit rate is set in &quot;user FRAM&quot; on the controller and
can be changed only by command on the serial interface. The
included DOS program LFMUSER can be used to change the bit rate.
New bit rate settings do not take effect until power has been
removed and restored to the controller. Once set, bit rate
settings are maintained permanently in &quot;user FRAM&quot;
until changed. The LF System uses a simple three wire interface.
Connections are Ground, Transmit Data, and Receive Data. No other
signal lines are used. The bit level protocol is asynchronous,
8-bit, no parity, 1 stop bit. </font></p>

<h2><font size="4">LF Controller/Card Protocol</font></h2>

<p><font size="3">When commanded to communicate with an LF
transponder (card), the LF Controller continuously produces an
unmodulated 125 KHz carrier from its antenna coil. The LF card
contains a coil of wire that derives energy from the controller
signal. The LF card, while being powered by a sufficiently
intense controller field, continuously transmits the
&quot;Configuration Word&quot; (hex 0340) via 62.5 KHz PSK,
Miller coded signal, except when responding to a command. Rather
than a transmitter/receiver system, the LF card and controller
should be thought of as a magnetically coupled system, like a
transformer. The controller communicates with the card through
only two instructions, read and write. The controller transmits
by FSK modulating the powering 125 KHz field. The read
instruction contains the &quot;Customer Code&quot; which must
match that of the card, or the instruction is ignored. If the
&quot;Customer Code&quot; matches, the remainder of the
instruction, containing start block and number of blocks to be
read, is received. The card then transmits these blocks via 62.5
KHz PSK, Miller coded signal. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">When the controller sends a &quot;write&quot;
instruction, besides including &quot;Customer Code&quot;, start
and number of blocks, and the data to be written, the instruction
contains the &quot;Unique ID&quot; of the card to be written. If
the &quot;Unique ID&quot; in a write instruction does not match
that of the card, the write message is ignored. When the
instruction is a &quot;Write Verify&quot;, the written blocks are
then read and compared to data intended to be written. If they
match, the instruction is concluded. If a mismatch occurs, a
re-write is performed beginning at the first errored block. This
process is repeated, if needed, until all written data has been
verified.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">When the controller performs a &quot;write with
CRC&quot;, the last two bytes (4 hex digits) of the final block
of the data blocks written are replaced with a CRC-16 value
calculated on the data in the blocks written by that command.
When the controller performs a &quot;read with CRC&quot;, data
from all blocks read (except the final two bytes, assumed to
contain CRC) is used to calculate a CRC which is compared with
the final two bytes (4 hex digits) read from the card. If these
do not match, a CRC error is reported to the host. If they do
match, the read data is transmitted to the host. Note that the
card does not participate in CRC calculations in any way, except
to retain the data calculated by the controller. CRC error
checking is not so much a security measure as a data integrity
process. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Customer Codes are assigned by Racom, and are
programmed into permanent ROM on the processor in the controller.
Along with Customer Codes, Unique IDs for each card are assigned
by Racom, and locked irrevocably into Block 0 on each card. Racom
certifies that no cards will be released without a Unique ID and
Customer Code per customer order locked into Block 0. Because of
this communications protocol, if a read transaction with CRC is
in process, and another card were to come between the antenna and
active card during the read, the controller would, at worst,
return a &quot;CRC Error&quot; message. Generally, the
communication would conclude properly. In no case would erroneous
data be received, if CRC error checking was utilized. If a card
was in the process of a write transaction and verified write was
in use, because the data resides in host or controller buffer
until verification is achieved, card contents could be garbled if
another card was inserted into the field, but an error situation
would be detected by the host, and data rewritten until data is
correct. In no circumstances could the newly inserted card be
written to or its data in any way corrupted. </font></p>

<h3><font size="3">The LF Controller Circuit Board</font></h3>

<p><font size="3">The LFC-BB controller is supplied as a bare
board connected to the antenna for installation in customer
supplied equipment. When installed as a board in customer
equipment, the customer is responsible for mounting, strain
relief on cables, shielding, as well as power supply. The
controller board measures 12.5 x 7.5 cm and as much as 1.5 cm
high (total thickness) for the tallest components. Screw mounting
holes are on 11.5 x 6.3 cm centers, centered on the board and are
.3 cm in diameter. Mounting holes have no circuit foil for screw
contact purposes and no foil closer than .3cm from the edge of
the underside of the hole. Care should be taken that screws and
mounting bosses do not contact any circuit foil or other devices
on the board. The bare board should be protected from static
discharges and strong electromagnetic interference. Use of
jumpers on the controller board is described in the LF System
Manual except for JP1, which is the manufacturing reset switch.
If this pin pair is jumpered, the controller defaults to:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Baud rate 9600 bits per second<br>
Echo on<br>
Node Hex FF<br>
Startup mode 0 Speaker does not beep on power up</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The jumper state is read only at power up of
the board, so the board must be powered down and back up before
these parameters apply. Contents of FRAM regarding these
parameters is not affected, so when the jumper is removed and
power is cycled, previously set parameters apply. These
parameters can be set via the serial interface while SF1 is
jumpered using the Write User FRAM in the LFMUSER.EXE DOS program
and the new values will apply when the jumper is removed and
power is cycled.</font></p>

<h3><font size="3">The LF-AA Controller (in plastic enclosure)</font></h3>

<p><font size="3">The plastic enclosure is a high quality plastic
enclosure protecting the controller board from dust and
reasonable environmental exposure. It is NOT waterproof or
unbreakable. It should not be directly exposed to weather or
severe shock or impact. While the cables are strain relieved,
they should not be pulled, twisted, or bent at the enclosure.
Since the controller board occupies most of the enclosure, holes
should not be drilled in it.</font></p>

<h3><font size="3">Power</font></h3>

<p><font size="3">Power is supplied to both the AA and BB
versions of the controller, as delivered from Racom, through a
coax &quot;barrel&quot; type connector with 4mm outer diameter
and 1mm post. The post (center) is negative (ground) with respect
to the barrel (outside). The power requirement for the LF
controller is regulated 12 volts +/-5%. There is no regulation of
12 volts on the board or protection from overvoltage or
transients since this board is expected to be used in customer
supplied equipment or with a Racom supplied external power
supply. Deviation from the specified voltage will result in poor
performance or damage to the controller.</font></p>

<h3><font size="3">Antenna</font></h3>

<p><font size="3">Standard versions of the LF controller are
supplied with attached antenna in a high quality plastic
enclosure. Each controller and antenna is supplied as a tuned
unit and should not be separated or performance will suffer. The
standard antenna enclosure is not sealed and should not be
exposed directly to weather.</font></p>

<h3><font size="3">Performance Considerations</font></h3>

<p><font size="3">The LF System operates via electromagnetic
energy near 100 KHz, below the American AM radio broadcast band.
Performance of the LF system is sensitive to RF interference such
as that produced by fluorescent lights, electric motors, and
computer monitors. These sources of interference should be
shielded or kept at a distance from the antenna. A few feet of
separation usually suffices to restore operating range but severe
sources of interference may require more distance. Adjacent
electromagnetic interference does not affect the controller
electronics board. Because metallic surfaces, particularly iron
or steel absorb and interfere with electromagnetic signals,
nearby metal or iron can severely impact performance of the LF
system. Presence of metal within 5 inches of antenna may reduce
working range.<br>

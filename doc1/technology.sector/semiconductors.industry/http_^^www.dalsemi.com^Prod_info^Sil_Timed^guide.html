<P><A NAME="intro"><H3>Introduction to This Guide</H3></A>
Delay lines aren't what they used to be.  And they're not used like they used to be.  Today's  Silicon Timed Circuits offer new ways to add functionality to a design, even fine-tune a design and bring it to completion as fast as we're driven to these days.  And today's delay lines have moved beyond the "last resort" reputation.  We've come a long way from the original hybrid delay lines comprised of coils and capacitors.  Those capacitors could introduce inductance and possible ringing into the system.  Who wanted to own up to a design with delay lines' bulky "DIP on steroids" packaging?  The advent of active hybrids alleviated things somewhat with on-chip buffers isolating the IC delay components, but the bulky packaging and reliability concerns remained.

<P>With the introduction of monolithic silicon delay lines by Dallas Semiconductor, all that changed.  Gone was the hybrid implementation, replaced by devices just like any other IC, offering standard IC packaging (including SOICs) and, most importantly, IC reliability levels.

<P>Some of the "delay line stigma" remains as a result of old attitudes.  Yet designers are increasingly looking at Dallas' Silicon Timed Circuits to solve design issues quickly and cost-efficiently.  Improvement in CAD tools has lessened the need for "band-aids" to hold together ASICs and other system components, a traditional delay line application.  Today these devices are finding growing acceptance as an integral part of a new system design.  Ironically, this is caused in part by increasing system clock rates which necessitate careful attention to timing tolerances.  Better to use a delay line than invoke a wait state!  In other instances, delay lines are quite simply the easiest way to achieve a particular design goal.

<P>This Designer's Guide contains an overview of our Silicon Timed Circuits delay line family, gives you insight into their function, and hopefully will give you some ideas about how they can help you with your design tasks.</TD></TR>

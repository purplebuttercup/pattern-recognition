<h2 align="center">Ferroelectric Random Access Memory (FRAM<sup>®</sup>)
</h2>

<h4><a name="FRAM TECHNOLOGY"><strong>FRAM TECHNOLOGY</strong> </a></h4>

<p>Racom contactless smart cards use a patented memory technology
that merges ferroelectric material with silicon to create
ferroelectric random access memory (FRAM<sup>® )</sup> This
advanced memory technology has significant benefits compared to
other existing memory products. Racom holds an exclusive license
from the developer, <a href="http://www.sni.net/ramtron">Ramtron
International Corporation of Colorado Springs</a>, Colorado to
utilize this technology in contactless smart cards. Ramtron is
the first semiconductor company to make the combined
breakthroughs necessary in materials, processing, and design to
manufacture solid state ferroelectric devices. Racom has access
to multiple Ramtron licensed manufacturers to ensure a reliable,
consistent supply of FRAM product. These licensees include Rohm
Company Limited of Japan, and other high volume semiconductor
manufacturers.</p>

<h4><font size="3"><strong><u>FRAM in SMART CARDS</u></strong></font></h4>

<p>FRAM technology is particularly well suited to smart card
applications due to a number of key benefits:</p>

<ul>
    <li>FRAM is<em> non-volatile </em>memory. It retains data
        even when power is not applied.</li>
    <li>FRAM has significantly<em> lower overall power
        consumption</em> than other technologies such as EEPROM.
        This makes FRAM especially useful in contactless
        applications where the card is powered from an RF signal.</li>
    <li>FRAM has <em>fast access</em> times for both reading and
        writing. Unlike EEPROM, FRAM memory has write times
        measured in the 100's of nano-seconds (ns). This makes it
        ideal in contactless applications where the entire
        transaction may take only 100 ms.</li>
    <li>FRAM technology is significantly more <em>reliable</em>
        than other memory technologies making field upgrades and
        programmability a reality.</li>
    <li>FRAM, through speed, lower power consumption and absence
        of stored electrical charge, may be less vulnerable to
        differential fault analysis and other cryptanalytic
        attacks on smart card security.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>&nbsp;</u><font size="3"><strong><u>FRAM TECHNOLOGY</u></strong></font></p>

<p>Ferroelectrics have been used for many years as pressure
transducers. In this application they were thick ceramics. In the
FRAM application, the material thickness is less than 1.0 micron.
The name ferroelectric, while no iron is used, was chosen because
the material's electrical properties are analogous to the
magnetic properties of ferromagnetic materials.</p>

<p>Ferroelectrics exhibit a unique ability to retain an electric
polarization in the absence of an applied electric field. This
stable polarization results from the alignment of internal
dipoles within the ferroelectric material. Application of an
electric field controls this alignment, allowing storage of
digital information in the material. </p>

<p>A simplified model of a unit ferroelectric crystal is shown in
figure 1. </p>

<p>An externally applied electric field will move the center atom
into one of the two stable positions shown based upon the
direction of the field. Once the external field is removed, the
atom remains in a stable position. Since no external electric
field or current is required for the ferroelectric material to
remain polarized in either state, a memory device can be built
for storing digital (binary) data that will not require power to
retain information stored within it. </p>

<p>Ramtron has developed a complex proprietary thin-film
ferroelectric material which is compatible with standard
semiconductor fabrication techniques. The nonvolatile storage
element in FRAM memories is a capacitor constructed from two
metal electrodes and a ferroelectric thin film inserted between
the transistor and metallization layers of a CMOS process. </p>

<p>Data stored in a ferroelectric memory cell can be read by
applying an electric field to the capacitor. If the applied field
is in the direction to switch the internal dipoles, more charge
will be moved than if the dipoles are not reversed. Sense
amplifiers built into the FRAM chips measure this charge and
produce either a zero or one on the output pins. After the read
takes place, the chip automatically restores the correct data to
the cell. </p>

<p>Another aspect of the ferroelectric material, its very high
dielectric constant, permits the very efficient construction of
capacitor elements on the chip. For use as both data storage,
such as in a DRAM cell, or power storage, such as on a remotely
accessed system, this property of the material offers the
potential for a wide variety of new devices. </p>

<h4><strong><u>FRAM ARCHITECTURE</u></strong> </h4>

<p>FRAM memories combine the features of several different types
of memory to offer a true system memory solution. They integrate
the fast reads and writes of SRAM, the non-volatility of EEPROM,
and very high read/write endurance onto a single, cost effective
chip. </p>

<p>Current FRAM products are built using a dual element
differential sense approach, as shown in figure 1.</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;<img src="dual.jpg" width="490"
height="383"></p>

<p>&nbsp;In this architecture, somewhat like a SRAM cell, two
nonvolatile elements are integrated in every memory cell, each
polarized in the opposite direction. To read the state of the
memory cell, both nonvolatile elements are polarized in the same
direction. A differential amplifier (sense amp) connected to the
bit lines measures the difference between the amount of charge
transferred from the two cells and sets the output accordingly. </p>

<p>Like a DRAM, all FRAM accesses modify the state of the storage
element, which is then internally restored by the chip during the
precharge portion of the cycle. This operation takes place
automatically, without any intervention from the system. </p>

<h4><font size="3"><strong><u>ADVANTAGES of FRAM</u></strong></font></h4>

<p>Two key aspects of the FRAM technology are superior to EEPROM
technologies. First, it employs a polarization technique instead
of a charge tunneling mechanism. Second, it permits all internal
operations to utilize five volts, instead of the 15 to 18 volts
required by conventional EEPROM technologies. These two aspects
result in superior performance in the area of <a
href="FRAM.htm#FRAM Speed">speed</a>,<a
href="FRAM.htm#FRAM Power Consumption"> power consumption</a>,
and <a href="FRAM.htm#FRAM Reliability">reliability</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="FRAM Speed"><font size="3">FRAM Speed</font></a></h4>

<p>In order to program (write) a state into a FRAM cell, the
electric field need be applied for less than 100ns in order to
polarize the nonvolatile elements. In a standard EEPROM, it takes
a millisecond or more for sufficient charge to travel through the
insulating oxides to charge up the gate element. In addition, the
high voltage generation circuitry takes some time to stabilize
before it can cause this transfer to take place. These
differences allow a FRAM memory cycle time of 500ns worst case,
compared to 10ms for an EEPROM. </p>

<h4><a name="FRAM Power Consumption"><strong>FRAM Power
Consumption</strong></a></h4>

<p>High voltage generation in an EEPROM requires an oscillator,
charge pump, charge storage capacitor, and regulator circuit on
the chip, which takes significant area on an EEPROM. In addition,
this added circuitry increases the power consumption of the chip,
which can be quite significant for some products. For example, a
typical serial 4K FRAM memory uses 10 to 50 times less active
power than comparable EEPROM parts.</p>

<h4><a name="FRAM Reliability"><strong>FRAM Reliability</strong></a></h4>

<p>In an EEPROM, the charge tunneling across the oxide layer
degrades the characteristics of the oxide, causing catastrophic
breakdown or excessive trapped charge. For these reasons, EEPROM
devices are guaranteed for typically only 100,000 write cycles.
FRAM memories do not suffer from these same limitations, and so
can provide 10 billion (10<sup>10</sup>) cycles, although both
read and write operations must adhere to these limits. </p>

<TD WIDTH="50%" HEIGHT="314" VALIGN="TOP"><P><FONT COLOR="#00ff00" SIZE=+1>Mountain View, Calif.-Nov. 11, 1997: Trident
Microsystems Inc. today announced the world's first high-performance embedded
3D AGP multimedia flat-panel controller, the Cyber9520.  Trident once again
leads the graphics industry with the latest technology. <BR>
This highly integrated design, based on an advanced single-cycle 3D graphics
engine with 2MB of embedded 100MHz synchronous DRAM, provides many unique
features to the mobile platform.  The Cyber9520&#153;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ff00">
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ff00" SIZE=+1>brings together the best-of-breed features
in 2D, 3D and MPEG2/1 acceleration and power management.  It provides facilities
for videoconferencing/dual display and remains the company's strongest showcase
of its proprietary rCADE3D&Ouml;, TrueVideor and Multiview technologies.
<BR>
&quot;This is the world's first high-performance embedded 3D graphics accelerator,
developed in collaboration between Trident and Samsung.  It is the only
3D embedded device available today to incorporate an advanced 3D graphics
engine for arcade-quality 3D performance that the mobile market demands,&quot;
said Frank Lin, president and CEO of Trident Microsystems. &quot;The portable
market represents a large part of our revenue, and we expect that our new
embedded Cyber&#153;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ff00"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ff00"
 SIZE=+1> line of products will further strengthen our position in the growing
portable PC market.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#00ff00" SIZE=+1>The Cyber9520&#153;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ff00">
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ff00" SIZE=+1> is equipped with an advanced single-cycle
3D graphics <BR>
engine based on Trident's rCADE3D technology.  Some of the 3D features include
Z-buffering, Gouraud shading, alpha-blending, specular lighting, fog effect
and dithering. It supports Microsoft's D3D level 3 and offloads major 3D
tasks from the CPU.  To further accelerate 3D and 2D functions, the new
device has an enhanced AGP interface that supports 66/133MHz AGP with sideband
support to allow high-speed and high-quality texture fetching from system
memory. <BR>
The Cyber9520&#153;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ff00"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ff00"
 SIZE=+1> provides dual / simultaneous display, which permits the <BR>
user to have multiple views on a single flat </FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN="TOP"><P><FONT COLOR="#00ff00" SIZE=+1>panel or on the flat panel and CRT or television
under both Win95 and Win98.  The device accommodates various sources of
graphics with different refresh rates, resolutions or color depths.  The
dual video can display simultaneously two live video windows that are fully
scaleable and independent of each other, as in a live videoconferencing
situation where remote and local video streams have to be handled. The integrated
TrueVideo processor and capture engine enhance the dual display apertures
on the PCI bus, enabling graphic and video data to be transported simultaneously
without software involvement.<BR>
Unlike the majority of portable devices on the market today, the Trident
low-power cell design chip has flexible and extensive mobile power management
capabilities. Eight methods for power saving have been implemented, including
the 2D/3D graphic engines dynamically clock down without software control,
and function blocks can be independently clocked down through register controls
and pins.  AGP and PCI power management are also implemented. Mini-driver
function calls are used to support ACPI.<BR>
Trident Microsystems, Inc. (NASDAQ: TRID), with headquarters in Mountain
View, California, designs, develops and markets graphics controllers and
multimedia integrated circuits for PCs.  Trident's products are sold through
a network of OEMs, original design manufacturers and system integrators
worldwide. </FONT></P>

<H2>KEMET Announces New Ceramic 
Surface-Mount Capacitor Array
</h2>
<h3>

Multi-Element Ceramic Capacitor Provides Numerous Benefits 
 
</H3>
<br>
<p align=left>
September 9, 1997 (Greenville, South Carolina) --  KEMET Electronics Corporation 
today announced its entry into the rapidly growing ceramic surface-mount capacitor array 
marketplace. <br><br>

The new KEMET 1632 ceramic surface-mount capacitor array incorporates four individual 0603 
ceramic capacitor elements into one common 1206 monolithic multilayer structure. 
This multi- element capacitor array requires only a fraction of the board space required for four
individual capacitors, allowing for increased board density and more circuit function per unit area. 
Additionally, single unit placement (rather than four individual capacitor placements) and reduced 
inventory requirements associated with the 1632 array allow for significant reduction in operating,
capital equipment, and inventory costs across all market segments of the electronics industry.<br><br>


The 1632 array is being standardized by the EIA, and will soon be included in EIA documentation. 
KEMET's 1632 arrays, which are manufactured in QS-9000 registered facilities, use the same basic 
technologies and systems currently used in KEMET 0603 ceramic surface-mount capacitors. 
Each 1632 capacitor array is individually tested to ensure capacitance, dissipation factor, 
voltage exposure, and insulation resistance. In addition, every array is tested to ensure that 
each element in the monolithic structure is electrically isolated, an extremely imporatant 
consideration for multi-element designs such as this one. <br><br>


KEMET will offer the ceramic 1632 arrays in the C0G dielectric with a capacitance range 
of 10pF-470pF, and in the X7R dielectric with a capacitance range of 330pF-0.10µF in 16, 25, 
and 50 volts. The arrays will be available in tape and reel packaging with 4,000 arrays per 7" reel, 
or 10,000 arrays per 13" reel. Samples will be available in late September, with full production 
scheduled to begin in October, 1997. <br><br>


KEMET Corporation, headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina, is the largest manufacturer 
of solid tantalum capacitors in the world and the second largest manufacturer of multilayer 
ceramic capacitors in the United States. KEMET's common stock is listed on the NASDAQ 
Stock Market's National Market under the symbol KMET. Company information is available 
on the Internet at http://www.kemet.com. <br><br>

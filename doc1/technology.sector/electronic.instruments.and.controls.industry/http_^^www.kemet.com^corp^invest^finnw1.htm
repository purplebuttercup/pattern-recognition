<STRONG>KEMET CORPORATION TO INVEST $72 MILLION IN
SURFACE-MOUNT MANUFACTURING CAPACITY
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Expanding Global Sales to Mainland China
</STRONG>

<p align=left>
Greenville, South Carolina (July 24, 1997) - KEMET Corporation
(Nasdaq/NM:KMET) announced at the Company's Annual Meeting 
that it plans to invest approximately $72 million in fiscal 1998 in its surface-mount
manufacturing capacity to meet growing worldwide demand for its ceramic
and tantalum capacitors.  It was also announced that the Company has
established direct sales offices in both Shanghai and Beijing, as well as a
new global logistics hub in Shanghai to serve the rapidly growing mainland 
China electronics market. <br><br>

"KEMET plans to expand its manufacturing capacity for surface-mount capacitors
to meet growing world-wide demand from our key customers," stated KEMET 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David E. Maguire.  "Over 75% of our 
current manufacturing capacity of 65 million capacitors a day is focused on
surface-mount technology.  We plan to increase our production capacity of 
surface-mount capacitors with the expansion of three plants.<br><br>


"We are adding 70,000 square feet to our Ceramic Technology Center in 
Fountain Inn, South Carolina, and are doubling the manufacturing clean rooms
at our ceramic surface-mount plant in Shelby, North Carolina.  
These investments will complement and support our recently completed 
240,000 square-foot ceramic surface-mount manufacturing plant in 
Monterrey, Mexico.  In addition, we are doubling our anode manufacturing 
capacity at our Simpsonville, South Carolina, tantalum surface-mount plant to
maintain our position as the number one supplier of tantalum capacitors in the world.<br><br>


"The expansion of our Ceramic Technology Center will allow KEMET to reduce
the lead time from development to full-scale production of new products.  In addition, 
we plan to invest approximately $23 million in research and development in fiscal 1998.  
We believe this increased level of investment will expand our leadership in 'first-to-market'
new products."<br><br>


"We believe our increased manufacturing capacity will allow us to aggressively expand 
our sales and logistics networks into mainland China," continued Mr. Maguire. 
 "Our just-in-time delivery network will allow us to supply our capacitors to China, 
or virtually anywhere in the world, within one to two days.  We believe our added 
capacity, combined with our continued focus on quality, delivery and service, 
will result in KEMET's gaining market share on a world-wide basis in the coming year."<br><br>


The Company also reported that stockholders elected the following directors to serve 
three-year terms:<br><br>


Charles E. Volpe - retired President and Chief Operating Officer of KEMET Corporation<br><br>


Charles E. Corpening - Vice President of Citicorp Venture Capital, Ltd., a subsidiary of Citibank<br><br>

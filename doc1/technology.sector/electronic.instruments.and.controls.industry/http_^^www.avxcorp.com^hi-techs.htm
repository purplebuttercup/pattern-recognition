A story that last week was chosen<BR>
your interest to engage,<BR>
about a breakfast with Dick Rosen,<BR>
appeared on our front page.<BR>
Now Mr. Rosen's one, we know,<BR>
who knows his stuff, his techs,<BR>
as chairman and as CEO<BR>
of the firm called AVX.<BR>
Capacitors, connectors and<BR>
resistors are their game -<BR>
such components, in demand,<BR>
contribute to their fame.<BR>
In recent years (for the last five)<BR>
their gains were no mere ripple:<BR>
they grow, they flourish, and they thrive -<BR>
with sales now more than triple.<BR><BR>

How has this happened?  Can you guess?<BR>
Does this your interest pique?<BR>
By providing more for less<BR>
of products tr&#232;s unique!<BR>
The market within which it vies<BR>
for ever greater shares<BR>
faces a need to downsize<BR>
its already wee wares.<BR>
Smaller than a pepper grain<BR>
is mighty mighty small;<BR>
any smaller and it's plain<BR>
you won't see them at all!<BR>
One need make no apologies<BR>
for shrinking from the massive<BR>
by means of new technologies<BR>
an integrated passive.<BR><BR>

With no suggestion of reluctance<BR>
Mr. Rosen tells<BR>
of products that reduce inductance,<BR>
which his firm proudly sells.<BR>
Their "Advanced Products" contract<BR>
heart pacers' size.  What's more<BR>
they can shrink phones, and that's a fact.<BR>
What else have they in store?<BR>
With such progress one foresees<BR>
limitless possibilities!<BR><BR>

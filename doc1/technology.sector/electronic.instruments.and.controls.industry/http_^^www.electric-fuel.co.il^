content="Electric Fuel develops, produces and commercializes a zinc-air energy system for powering electric 
vehicles. It uses a proprietary zinc-air technology that is ideal for use by fleet operators. Fleet vehicles 
continuously drive on inner city routes and are a major cause of urban air pollution. 
Fleets use central hubs for their large number of vehicles and are well suited for the installation of the 
infrastructure required to adapt to new technology, such as the Electric Fuel zinc-air system. As large 
fleet operators adopt electric vehicles, an expanded Electric Fuel infrastructure would become available 
to small fleet operators and eventually to individuals.
In field trials with major European entities, Electric Fuel is proving the commercial viability of its battery 
system by regularly demonstrating 350 to 450 km in actual drive cycles.
The Electric Fuel zinc-air battery consists of a battery pack with removable zinc-anode cassettes. The 
battery currently provides an energy density of over 180 Wh/kg and 100 W/kg. An automated battery 
exchange unit located at the fleet garage or at a refueling station enables rapid vehicle turn-around. A 
refueling machine is used to replace the depleted anode cassettes with recycled and recharged cassettes. In 
the regeneration process, the discharged zinc oxide is dissolved in an electrolytic process that forms 
charged zinc particles that are then made into new anode cassettes.

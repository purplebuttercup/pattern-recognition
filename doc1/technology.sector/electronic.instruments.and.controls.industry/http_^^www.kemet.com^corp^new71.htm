September 9, 1997 (Greenville, South Carolina) -- KEMET Electronics Corporation
today announced a breakthrough in solid tantalum capacitor technology.  KEMET's new
T510 series offers the industry's lowest ESR in the popular EIA 7343H footprint. 
This new part has an ESR specification of 30 milliohms maximum at 100kHz. 
This performance is significantly better than other low ESR tantalums on the market today, 
and unlike non-molded types, offers the advantages of a user-friendly, volumetrically-efficient 
molded package. The T510's combination of high CV, low ESR and small size reinforces
KEMET's position as the world leader in tantalum technology.

KEMET has developed an innovative construction platform that incorporates multiple capacitor
elements, in parallel, inside a single package.  This unique assembly, combined with KEMET's
superior processing technology, results in a much lower ESR than can be achieved in a traditional 
single element package. Other benefits include superior capacitance retention at high frequencies
and reduced ESL.<br><br>
The T510 series was designed to provide ultra low ESR for two specific applications: filtering
and decoupling. The very high ripple current capability (up to 3 Amps rms) makes this part the
ideal choice for Switch Mode Power Supply (SMPS) filtering.  The T510 will also revolutionize 
design solutions for power decoupling of leading-edge microprocessors by substantially reducing 
the part count necessary to achieve the total required cap and ESR. <br><br>

One leading-edge voltage regulator manufacturer has reported that the T510 produced a 20% 
improvement in transient response compared to the regular low ESR tantalum it replaced.  
The T510 also allows designers to replace large, through-hole aluminum capacitors with
volumetrically-efficient, surface-mountable devices.  The T510's unbeatable combination
of small size and low ESR in a surface mount package is unique in the industry.   <br><br>

The T510 series is initially available in a 470µF 6V device.  A 680µF 4V part and a 330µF
10V are targeted for release in 4QCY97.  All T510 products are tape and reel packaged 
per EIA 481-1.  <br><br>

KEMET Electronics is the world's largest manufacturer of solid tantalum capacitors and
is the second largest manufacturer of multilayer ceramic capacitors in the United States. 
KEMET offers leaded and surface-mount products in both dielectric families. Visit KEMET

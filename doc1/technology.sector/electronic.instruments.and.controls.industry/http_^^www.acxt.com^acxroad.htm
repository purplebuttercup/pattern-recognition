  COORS COMPLETES SPIN-OFF OF TECHNOLOGIES COMPANY</B> </P>
</CENTER>
<P>Golden, Colo. -- Adolph Coors Company (NASDAQ: ACCOB) and ACX Technologies,
 Inc. (NASDAQ: ACXT) today announced that the spin-off of ACX Technologies
 to the shareholders of Adolph Coors Company has been completed. Under the
 terms of the transaction, Adolph Coors Company shareholders of record at
 the close of business on Dec. 16, 1992, received one share of ACX Technologies
 common stock for every three shares of Adolph Coors Company stock owned.
 </P>
As of today, ACX Technologies, Inc. is a separate public company. The
common stock of ACX Technologies is traded on the National Association
of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ), National Market
System (NMS). From Dec. 10 until Dec. 18, 1992, ACX Technologies common
stock traded on a &quot;when issued&quot; basis. It began regular trading
under the symbol ACXT on Dec. 21, 1992. The Class B Common Stock of Adolph
Coors Company will continue to trade on NASDAQ under the symbol ACCOB.
A total of 12,575,507 shares of ACX Technologies will be distributed,
with cash being paid in lieu of fractional shares of ACX Technologies stock.
The First Bank of Boston, acting as distribution agent, is mailing stock
certificates of ACX Technologies, Inc. to all Adolph Coors Company shareholders
of record on Dec. 16, 1992. Within the next few weeks, Adolph Coors Company
will send information to each shareholder concerning the allocation of
tax basis between Adolph Coors and ACX Technologies stock. 
An Information Statement containing financial and other information
concerning ACX Technologies has been mailed to Adolph Coors Company shareholders.
In addition, a Registration Statement of ACX Technologies common stock,
filed under the Securities Act of 1934, is effective and on file with the
Securities Exchange Commission. 
As an independent company, ACX Technologies will have better access
to capital sources to finance the growth of its diversified businesses
and the commercialization of new technologies and will have greater managerial
flexibility to respond to business opportunities. The separation of Adolph
Coors Company into two publicly owned companies will also permit investors,
lenders and other constituencies to evaluate better the separate businesses
of Adolph Coors Company and ACX Technologies. ACX Technologies owns the
ceramics, aluminum, packaging and technology-based developmental businesses
previously owned by Adolph Coors Company. 
ACX Technologies, with 1991 net sales of approximately $544 million,
would have ranked among the 500 largest publicly traded industrial corporations
in the United States, if it had been a separate company in that year. Its
principal manufacturing subsidiaries are Coors Ceramics Company, Graphic
Packaging Corporation and Golden Aluminum Company. Golden Technologies
Company, Inc., its other subsidiary, is engaged primarily in the development
and commercialization of new technologies. 
Adolph Coors Company -- based on 1991 net sales of Coors Brewing Company,
its principal operating subsidiary -- is one of the 500 largest publicly
traded industrial corporations in the United States. Coors Brewing Company
is the third-largest brewer in the United States and operates the world's
largest single-site brewery in Golden. 
In connection with the spin-off, in early January, Adolph Coors Company
will make publicly available pro forma financial information for fiscal
1991 and the 40-week period ending Oct. 4, 1992, reflecting results as
if the distribution had occurred at the beginning of those periods. <BR>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><I><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Times New Roman">In 1996 ACX Technologies,
 Inc. completed its forth year as
 an independent, publicly owned company.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Times New Roman"><I>
 It </I><I>was a year
 of beneficial transition
 and progress. ACX is pleased to report
 that revenues grew by eight percent to
 $712 million. Operating income increased </I><I>by three percent to $63 million
 from
 continuing operations, before asset impairments and restructuring charges. During
 1996 ACX decided to exit the </I><I>rolled aluminum business and refocus it efforts
 in
 advanced technical ceramics and specialty packaging.</I><I><BR>
 <BR>
 </I><I>On record sales of $276 million, Coors Ceramics Company earned $44 million
 in operating income, with one of the industry’s highest returns on average net
 assets. This was achieved during a year in which </I><I>demand for electronic
 ceramics
 products declined. Coors Ceramics Company’s </I><I>ability
 to continually develop
 new markets and products attests to the diversity of its capabilities and strength
 of its management team. With compound annual index sales growth of almost 11 percent
 for the last four years, Coors Ceramics is well-positioned for continued growth.
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Graphic Packaging Corporation achieved its eighth consecutive year of record sales
 and operating income in 1996. Sales reached $347 million, while operating income
 grew by 19 percent to $41 million. Plant floor efficiency improvements increased
 operating margins. Revenue and operating income were enhanced through the acquisition
 of Gravure Packaging, Inc., a specialty folding carton company. Facilities and
 management are in place for continued growth, while Graphic Packaging looks for
 strategic, synergetic acquisition opportunities in the consolidating industry.
 <BR>
 <BR>
 ACX scaled back solar module manufacturing while refocusing on solar electric
 power systems. The purchase of a controlling interest in Photocomm, Inc,. one
 of the world’s leading
 integrators
 and distributors
 of solar electric power systems,
 places the solar business in leadership position in this rapidly growing industry.
 <BR>
 <BR>
 While 1996 was year of transition and flat precharge earnings per share, our core
 businesses were strong, setting
 the stage for opportunity and growth in 1997.
 After the 1996 decision to exit the aluminum business, </I><I>the sale of Golden
 Aluminum
 Company was completed in March of 1997. To meet growing product demand, ACX plans
 to invest approximately $50 million in its ceramics and packaging businesses.
 In </I><I>addition, ACX is seeking synergistic
 acquisition opportunities to more aggressively
 grow these two businesses.
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Pioneering customer solutions has been the Company’s strength and the hallmark
 of ACX since its inception. Whether through offering innovative products form
 technical ceramics Composipac, ComposiGard and ComposiCup packaging or providing
 a remote village with electricity via solar power, ACX finds solutions to its
 customers’ problems with products that are unique and effective. ACX has financial
 resources exemplified by a strong balance sheet, an excellent customer base and
 management commitment to grow core businesses. The Company’s goal is to enhance
 shareholder value continually and earn your trust as a valued shareholder in ACX
 Technologies, Inc.

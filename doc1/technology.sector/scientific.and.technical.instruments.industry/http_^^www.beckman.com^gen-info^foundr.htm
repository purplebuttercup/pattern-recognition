<p>Arnold O. Beckman, founder-chairman emeritus of Beckman
Instruments, Inc., represents nearly a century of outstanding
scientific achievements. Considered one of the top five inventors
of scientific instruments, Dr. Beckman created devices that
revolutionized the study and understanding of human biology,
ultimately saving countless lives around the world.<br>
<br>
Dr. Beckman once said, &quot;There is no satisfactory substitute
for excellence.&quot; More than just words, this philosophy
guides his life and helped shape scientific history. Throughout
his legacy of excellence, Dr. Beckman has assumed many roles --
that of educator, inventor, civic leader, philanthropist and
humanitarian. The foundation of his highly decorated career has
always been his personal integrity and his love for science.<br>
<br>
Born in the small farming community of Cullom, Ill., on April 10,
1900, young Arnold Beckman's interest in science was first piqued
upon finding a chemistry book in the family attic. Not long after
reading Steele's Fourteen Weeks in Science, originally published
in 1861, he converted a tool shed built for him by his father for
his 10th birthday into a makeshift chemistry lab.<br>
<br>
Dr. Beckman began a more serious study of science at the
University of Illinois, where he received his bachelor's degree
in chemical engineering in 1922, followed by his master's degree
in physical chemistry one year later. Throughout his school
years, he also tapped into his creative talents by playing piano
in silent movies to help support his family and fund his
education. Beckman went on to receive his doctorate in
photochemistry at the California Institute of Technology (1928),
where he also served as a professor.<br>
<br>
While he was still teaching, Dr. Beckman founded what eventually
became Beckman Instruments, Inc. in 1935 with the invention of
the acidimeter. Produced for a former classmate at a Southern
California citrus processing plant, Beckman designed the
acidimeter to measure acidity levels in lemon juice. The
acidimeter was later called a pH meter and quickly became an
indispensable tool in analytical chemistry. The invention earned
him a place in the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1987,
joining other great inventors like Thomas Edison and Alexander
Bell. Dr. Beckman once stated, &quot;When you're faced with the
necessity to do something, that's a stimulus to invention. If [my
classmate] hadn't come in with his lemon juice problem, chances
are I never in the world would have thought about making a pH
meter.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dr. Beckman continued to develop and manufacture scientific
instruments, leading to the release of the DUÆ Spectrophotometer
in 1940. Considered the scientific equivalent of the Model T,
this product not only simplified tedious laboratory procedures,
it also increased analytical precision and revolutionized
chemical analysis.<br>
<br>
These extraordinary contributions led President Bush to award Dr.
Beckman the National Medal of Science in 1989 for his leadership
in analytical instrumentation development and for his deep
concern for the vitality of the nation's scientific enterprises.
He was also nationally recognized under the Reagan administration
with the 1989 Presidential Citizens Medal for his exemplary deeds
of service and the 1988 National Medal of Technology for
outstanding technological contributions to the United States.<br>
<br>
Dr. Beckman's love of science and spirit of invention lives on in
Beckman Instruments, Inc., a company with modest beginnings that
today is one of the world's leading manufacturers of instruments
and suppliers to the clinical diagnostics and life sciences
markets. Currently, the company has about 6,200 employees in 35
facilities worldwide and operates in more than 120 countries and
territories. Even though the company has made a wide variety of
products over the years, including a &quot;rock smasher&quot; for
a Mars robot mission and an electronic radio-like component
called a Helipot, it has never strayed very far from Dr.
Beckman's original focus on &quot;the chemistry of life.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The past years have been rewarding for me in many
ways,&quot; said Dr. Beckman, during the Golden Anniversary
celebration for Beckman Instruments, Inc. &quot;Perhaps the
greatest reward is the knowledge that Beckman products have
contributed and are contributing to the progress of
mankind.&quot; </p>

Fullerton, Calif., and the Illinois State University in Normal,
Ill. &quot;I've always enjoyed explaining things, whether it's
called teaching or anything else,&quot; says Dr. Beckman.
&quot;It's a challenge to my skill in trying to convey what's on
my mind.&quot; </p>

<h3><a name="Philanthropy">Philanthropy</a> </h3>

<p>Dr. Beckman is deeply grateful to the scientific community

<h3><a name="Civic Activities">Civic Activities</a> </h3>

<p>A man of strong moral and ethical principles, Dr. Beckman has
always been compelled to give back to the community at large. One
of his ongoing concerns was the growing problem of air pollution.
He was instrumental in initiating the studies on the sources of
photochemical smog and later helped develop control regulations
and warning procedures for Los Angeles County.<br>
<br>
In 1953, Dr. Beckman served as chairman of a special technical
committee on air pollution appointed by the governor of
California. The committee's report on scientific findings and its
recommendations for smog reduction served as a standard reference
for later air pollution control programs. In 1970, President
Nixon named Dr. Beckman to a four-year term on the Federal Air
Quality Control Board.<br>
<br>
He was named Outstanding Citizen of the Year (1972) by the Orange
Coast, Calif., Community College District for his continuing
pollution control work in the state and the nation, as well as
for the development of new instruments that have advanced man's
knowledge. Dr. Beckman was a member of the Board of Overseers of
the House Ear Institute, a director of Hoag Memorial Hospital
Presbyterian and the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation. He
was also an honorary trustee of the California Museum Foundation.<br>
<br>
Dr. Beckman was past president of the Los Angeles Chamber of
Commerce (1956) and the California State Chamber of Commerce
(1967). He was a director of the Security Pacific National Bank,

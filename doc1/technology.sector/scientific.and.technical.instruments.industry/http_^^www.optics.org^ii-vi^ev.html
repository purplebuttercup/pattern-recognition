These include hybridized, charge sensitive preamplifiers and associated electronics that are uniquely optimized for radiation detection applications. The radiation sensitive materials offered include most common scintillators for x-ray and gamma-ray detection, PIN diodes for low energy x-ray detection and CdTe/CdZnTe.</P><H3>The Right Combination</H3><P>Early in 1992, <STRONG>eV PRODUCTS</STRONG> and II-VI Incorporated merged their respective radiation businesses to form a team that possesses in-depth expertise and capabilities from crystal growth and materials science to radiation detector applications engineering and instrumentation interfacing. The business unit which resulted from this merger now offers a significant line of catalog products suitable for most applications. eV PRODUCTS also offers a complete custom design and fabrication service.</P><HR><H3>Hybrid Electronics</H3><P>The hybrid, charge sensitive preamplifiers are at the heart of <STRONG>eV PRODUCTS</STRONG>' state-of-the-art capabilities. Satisfying the most demanding of applications, our hybrid circuit technology has been optimized to provide the best performance possible at both the ultra low noise [&lt;1 kev RMS (Si)] and ultra fast (&lt;1 &#181;s falltime) ends of the spectrum. In addition to the standard range of preamplifiers, eV PRODUCTS also offers a hybrid shaping amplifier, a single channel analyzer and a miniature HV power supply.</P><H3>CdZnTe Detectors</H3><P><STRONG>eV PRODUCTS</STRONG> is making solid-state room temperature radiation detectors available to all instrument designers, researchers and experimentalists by increasing the active dimensions and reducing the cost. As a result of recent advances in the use of High Pressure Bridgeman techniques, CdZnTe is now available in a greater range of sizes, and at much lower prices than ever before. <STRONG>eV PRODUCTS</STRONG> can supply various detector packages, both with and without integral preamp. Custom detector mountings are available on request.</P><H3>CsI(Tl)/PIN Diode Detectors</H3><P>With a wide range of dimensions and levels of performance, the eV-250/252 Series of CsI(Tl)/PIN diode detector combines the known attributes of a scintillator based detector with the added advantages of low voltage operation, immunity to magnetic fields, smaller size and greater durability.</P><P>The <STRONG>eV PRODUCTS</STRONG> team routinely works with customers to produce custom designs to satisfy special requirements such as waterproof, low power operation, miniaturization, etc.</P><HR><TABLE CELLSPACING=3><TR><td><H2><A NAME="summary">Product Summary</A></H2></td></tr><TR><TD><UL><LI>Solid State Radiation Detection<LI>CdZnTe Based Detectors<LI>CsI(Tl)/PIN Diode Detectors<LI>Ultra Low Noise Preamplifiers<LI>Hybrid Electronics</UL></TD><TD><IMG WIDTH=142 HEIGHT=96 VSPACE=3 HSPACE=3 ALT="photo" SRC="images/evdiv-142x96.jpg"></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><TABLE CELLSPACING=3><TR><TD><A HREF="ii-vi_home.html"><IMG WIDTH=85 HEIGHT=65 VSPACE=3 HSPACE=3 BORDER=0 ALT="II-VI Inc."ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://optics.org:8000/ii-vi/images/ii-vi-lil.gif"></A><p>Email:<br><A HREF="mailto:evsales@aol.com">eVsales@aol.com</A></TD><TD><UL><LI><A HREF="infrared.html">II-VI Inc.

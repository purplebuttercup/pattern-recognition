INTRODUCES READY-TO-USE, PRE-WET, NON-DEWETTING CARTRIDGE FILTERS<BR>

<CENTER><P>SAN FRANCISCO, July 14, 1997 – Millipore Corporation’s Microelectronics
Divisions are introducing the new QuickChange Filters for wet etch and
wet cleans applications in wafer processing at the opening of SEMICON West
’97.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>QuickChange Filters are the ultimate combination of high performance
and ease of use. They are pre-wet filters made entirely of Teflon that
deliver high flow and retention in a broad range of aqueous-based chemicals.
They are packaged in ultra pure DI water and ready to use out of the box.
A unique characteristic of these patented filters is non-dewetting. The
membrane surface energy of QuickChange filters, water wet, has a higher
affinity for water than air. QuickChange filters do not dewet in air, during
installation, during chemical dumps or drains, or in outgassing solutions,
such as SC1, SC2 and hydrogen peroxide. Gas bubbles are swept through the
pore, leaving the usable filtration area intact. This results in more consistent
flow rates and maintenance of stable process parameters.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Traditional PTFE membrane filters require cumbersome, time-consuming
and inconvenient IPA pre-wetting procedures. QuickChange filters completely
eliminate the time, cost, inconvenience and hazardous waste disposal associated
with conventional IPA pre-wetting. The lack of IPA pre-wetting also prevents
any alcohol/chemical interaction and eliminates a potential source of contamination.
In addition, the use of QuickChange dramatically reduces filter change-out
time, minimizes system downtime and lowers the cost of ownership.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Millipore Corporation is a multinational high technology company
that applies its purification technologies to critical research and manufacturing
problems in the microelectronics, biopharmaceutical and analytical laboratory
markets. Headquartered in Bedford, Massachusetts, the company employs 4,500
people in seven manufacturing plants and more than 30 subsidiaries and
sales offices around the world. Through this extensive network, Millipore
sells its products in more than 100 countries. Sales for the company in
1996, totaled $619 million, with 58 percent of the revenue coming from
outside of the Americas.</P></CENTER>

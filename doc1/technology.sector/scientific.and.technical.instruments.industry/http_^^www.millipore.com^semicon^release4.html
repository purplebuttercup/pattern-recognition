INTRODUCES NEW MASS FLOW CONTROLLER FOR PRECISE GAS REGULATION<BR>

<CENTER><P>SAN FRANCISCO, July 14, 1997 – Millipore Corporation’s Microelectronics
Divisions are introducing the Tylan UHP2000 Thermal Mass Flow Controller
at SEMICON West ’97. This new generation of streamlined MFC is designed
exclusively for difficult semiconductor processing applications, such as
metal etch, silicon nitride, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and other
applications that produce condensable or particle by-products.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>The Tylan UHP2000 mass flow controller is easy to use and offers
greater cleanliness than its predecessors. Compact in size and lightweight,
the device requires a smaller mounting surface, promoting faster installation
and easier replacement. An all-metal flowpath minimizes moisture retention
and provides for better corrosion resistance. The Tylan UHP2000 MFC also
features laminar flow throughout with a fully swept, gas-wetted flowpath
and a diaphragm sealed solenoid valve. The result is significantly faster
drydown and reduced dead volume that minimizes contamination problems.
It is constructed of 7 uinch Ra electropolished 316L stainless steel surface
finish or corrosion resistant Hastelloy C-22.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>In addition, the new Tylan UHP2000 MFC includes a digital electronics
option, allowing for onboard diagnostics (i.e., predictive preventive maintenance),
providing the capability for statistical process control metrices. A single
device can be calibrated for as little as two gases and as many as nine.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>The Tylan UHP2000 MFC offers improved mass flow control response
time with its capability to address processes which involve fast chemical
reactions, such as dry etch, with minimal overshoot or undershoot. It provides
consistently repeatable chemistry for improved device performance characteristics
and throughput.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>The Tylan UHP2000 MFC technology capability is brought to Millipore
Microelectronics through its 1997 acquisition of Tylan General, Inc., a
leading supplier of advanced process management equipment such as flow
control and vacuum measurement devices and integrated gas panels. The integration
of Tylan General’s complementary technologies and resources provides Millipore
with a unique opportunity to offer semiconductor manufacturers complete,
value-added solutions for pure gas delivery and distribution.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Millipore Corporation is a multinational high technology company
that applies its purification technologies to critical research and manufacturing
problems in the microelectronics, biopharmaceutical and analytical laboratory
markets. Headquartered in Bedford, Massachusetts, the company employs 4,500
people in seven manufacturing plants and more than 30 subsidiaries and
sales offices around the world. Through this extensive network, Millipore
sells its products in more than 100 countries. Sales for the company in
1996, totaled $619 million, with 58 percent of the revenue coming from
outside of the Americas.</P></CENTER>

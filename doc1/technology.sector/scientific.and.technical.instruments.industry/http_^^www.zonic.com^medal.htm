<p><strong>The Medallion is the </strong><strong><u>first</u></strong><strong>
Mobile FFT Analyzer offering multichannel signal condition,
filter, digitization, and high-speed FFT measurement in a small,
lightweight, portable package. Installed in a laptop PC via the
PCMCIA slot, the Medallion gives the engiineer on the move a
powerful, instrument grade, dynamic signal analyzer.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Medallion addresses many of the problems system
integrators typically have with PC plug-in FFT boards; such
assuch as differential input, integral ICP, simultaneous sample
and hold, wide dynamic range and a slot (PCI or ISA) to fit into
most laptop PC's. At the same time, the Medallion eliminates the
problems test engineers find with instruments and PC/Workstation
based turn-key systems; such as transportability, cost,
reliability, and software customization/flexibility. The
Medallion Series is quite simple in concept, yet extremely
advanced in technology.</strong></p>

<p><strong>This greatly simplifies integration with your PC,
guarantees the accuracy of your test system, and lets you take
the system where you need it most. </strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong><u>Simple in Concept</u></strong></p>

<p><strong>Consisting of a PCMCIA (Type III) DSP card and a small
external Input Channel Module (9.5 x 7.25 x 1.5 inches), the
Medallion weighs under two pounds and can be AC, DC, or Battery
powered. It connects to a standard Laptop or Desktop PC running
Microsoft</strong><font size="1"><sup><strong>(R)</strong></sup></font><strong>
Windows</strong><font size="1"><sup><strong>(TM)</strong></sup></font><strong>
95</strong><font size="1"><sup><strong>(TM)</strong></sup></font><strong>
or Windows</strong><font size="1"><sup><strong>(TM)</strong></sup></font><strong>
NT</strong><font size="1"><sup><strong>(TM)</strong></sup></font><strong>operating
systems. </strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong><u>Advanced In Technology </u></strong></p>

<p><strong>The Medallion offers FFT analysis (DC to 20 kHz) on
all 8 input channels and a high quality output channel for sine,
random, SOR, and ROS output. Simultaneous sampling across all
input channels eliminates any cross-channel time or phase
measurement errors. Each input channel has a dedicated 16-bit A/D
and anti-aliasing filter with programmable gain, typically a 80
dB SNR for low noise acquisition, and selectable AC, DC,
Differential, or ICP input. Time data can also be streamed to the
PC system disk at 12 kHz (sample rate) for all 8 input channels
simultaneously. </strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong><u>Open Software Architecture </u></strong></p>

<p><strong>The open software architecture of the Medallion allows
customization for a variety of applicatrions using 3rd party
programs, such as LabView&trade;, MATLAB&trade;, and Excel&trade;
via supplied LabView and DLL libraries. This open software
architecture allows users to combine 3rd party acquisition boards
(Thermocouples, RTD's, Strain gauges, etc.) with theMedallion to
form an integrated software solution.</strong></p>

<p><strong>For users who want a turn-key solution, Zonic is
offering its Fundamental Acquisition Software&trade; (FAS&trade;)
LabVIEW-based Virtual Instrument (VI) standard with the
Medallion. Zonic engineers have created an instrument that easily
&quot;walks&quot; the opertor through all aspects of setup,
acquisition, and data display. The Zonic FAS labVIEW VI
Development System is also available for simple modifications or
complete customization to the FAS user interface. Resultant data
or time history files can also be exported to most PC-based
analysis packages currently on the market (SMS STAR&trade;, ME
Scope&trade;, SDRC I-DEAS&trade;, etc.) via Binary or Universal
File formats for further analysis.</strong></p>

<p><strong>When it comes to hardware, Zonic is the expert in
designing real-time, high quality, data acquisition front-ends.
Our experience is in digital signal processing, A/D front-end
design, and the &quot;piping&quot; of that data in the most
efficient manner through the entire system. The Medallion offers
an excellent &quot;building block&quot; for any customized
application you may have. </strong></p>

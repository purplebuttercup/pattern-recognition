Net earnings for the period increased 27% to $2,112,000 ($0.32 per share) on revenues of $15,519,000.  These results compare with net earnings of $1,660,000 ($0.25 per share) on revenues of $12,110,000 in the first quarter of last fiscal year.<P>Manufacturing bookings increased 35% to $15,960,000 for the quarter from $11,823,000 for the same period last year.  Approximately 60% of the increase was attributable to bookings for infrared optics and materials and the remainder for products manufactured by the Company’s VLOC subsidiary.   <P>Revenues increased 28% to $15,519,000 for the quarter from $12,110,000 for the same period last year.  Nearly 80% of the increase inrevenues was attributable to shipments ofinfrared optics and materials, while improvedshipments from the Company's VLOC subsidiaryaccounted for the remainder of the increase.  <P>Manufacturing gross margin was $6,575,000 or 44% of net sales for the quarter compared to $5,244,000 or 45% of net sales for the same period last year.  The decrease in manufacturing gross margin was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies and increased expenses in the eV PRODUCTS division due to the expansion in operations required to fulfill the previously announced order for radiation detectors for Neoprobe Corporation.<P>Selling, general and administrative expenses were $3,450,000 or 22% of revenues for the quarter as compared to $3,030,000 or 25% of revenues for the same period last year.  The expense increase is attributable to higher general and administrative expenses needed to support the Company’s growth and higher compensation expense associated with the Company's worldwide profit-driven bonus programs. <P>Francis J. Kramer, president and chief operating officer stated, "Market demand for our infrared optics and materials increased nearly 35% compared to last year’s first quarter.  Our capacity expansion programs over the past year have positioned us well in this highly competitive market.  We are committed to meeting the increasing customer demands of product quality, shorter lead times, competitive pricing and on-time delivery.”<P>Headquartered in Saxonburg, Pennsylvania II-VI Incorporated designs, manufactures and markets optical and electro-optical components, devices and materials for precision use in infrared, near infrared, visible light and x-ray instruments and applications.

Net earnings for the fiscal year were $7,111,000 ($1.08 per share) on revenues of $52,741,000.  These results compare with net earnings of $4,371,000 ($0.70 per share) on revenues of $37,940,000 a year ago.  For the three months ended June 30, 1997, net earnings were $1,968,000 ($0.30 per share) on revenues of $14,790,000.  This compares with net earnings of $1,522,000 ($0.23 per share) on revenues of $11,826,000 for the same period last fiscal year.   <p>Bookings for the year increased 35% to $56,696,000 from $42,071,000 in last fiscal year. Bookings for the quarter increased 33% to $16,280,000 from $12,214,000 in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year.  For the year, nearly 90% of the increase was attributable to increased demand for solid-state and infrared laser optics and materials, while 10% of the increase related to the eV PRODUCTS division.  For the quarter, over half the increase was attributable to infrared optics and materials, about 25% to the eV PRODUCTS division and the remainder to solid-state laser materials and optics.  <p>Manufacturing revenues for the fourth quarter and fiscal year were $13,858,000 and $50,084,000 respectively.  This compares with last year’s fourth quarter and fiscal year manufacturing revenues of $10,937,000 and $36,266,000 respectively.  For the quarter, approximately 80% of the increase is attributable to infrared laser optics and materials, and 20% to solid-state laser materials and optics.  For the year, one-half of the increase is attributable to infrared laser optics and materials, about 45% to solid-state laser materials and optics and 5% to the eV PRODUCTS division.<p>Manufacturing gross margin was 45% of manufacturing revenues for this fiscal year as compared to 43% for last fiscal year.  The fourth quarter manufacturing gross margin percentage was 45% as compared to 44% last year.  The quarter and year-to-date increases reflect the lower per unit operating cost associated with the higher production volume and improved manufacturing efficiencies offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.<p>Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 1997 were $12,713,000 or 24% of revenues compared to $9,924,000 or 26% of revenues for last fiscal year.  For the fourth quarter, selling, general and administrative expenses were $3,522,000 or 24% of revenues compared to $3,031,000 or 26% of revenues for the same period last year.  The expense increase is attributable to higher compensation expense associated with the Company's worldwide profit-driven bonus programs and higher general and administrative expenses needed to support the Company’s growth.  <p>Francis J. Kramer, president and chief operating officer said, "Customer demand for all our products continues to grow rapidly, and we’ve invested in the capacity required to meet this demand.  During the past year our material production capacity for both ZnSe and YAG has been significantly expanded.  Optical fabrication capacity has increased with the startup of II-VI China and investments in advanced machinery and equipment at our manufacturing plants in Singapore, Florida and Pennsylvania.  At the present time we are constructing a 45,000 square foot manufacturing facility for our VLOC subsidiary in Port Richey, Florida and a 30,000 square foot manufacturing facility for our eV PRODUCTS division in Saxonburg, Pennsylvania.  These investments in capacity are aimed to meet the increased demand of our current customers and win new customers in every market we serve."<p>           *      *      *      *      *<p>Except for historical information contained herein, some matters discussed in this news release constitute forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.

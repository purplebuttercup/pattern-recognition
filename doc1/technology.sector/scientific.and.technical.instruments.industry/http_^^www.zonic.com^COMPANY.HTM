<h1 align="center">Welcome to Zonic</h1>

<p align="left"><strong>Zonic was founded 30 years ago as the
result of pioneering research in structural analysis at the
University of Cincinnati. Extensive research had shown that the
&quot;tuning&quot; of the dynamics of structures could give great
improvements in product performance and quality. </strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>Over the years, Zonic has continued to
introduce innovative tools to help people in a variety of
industries to design and manufacture products with enhanced
safety, quality, and marketability. We put this commitment into
practice in the design of all our systems. </strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>Today, Zonic designs and manufactures
noise and vibration measurement systems and software that are
used in the aerospace, automotive, chemical, paper, steel, and
utility industries. In virtually every major world market Zonic's
tools are effectively used to evaluate the performance of our
customers' products and processes. The difference that Zonic
makes is reflected in our commitment to offering you the best
vibration analysis tools available. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Zonic believes that your data acquisition shouldn't be
limited by your systems capabilities. We also believe that you
should not have to custom configure a system for data
acquisition. That's why Zonic systems are designed with many of
your requirements built in. Our systems provide broader dynamic
ranges, more input channels, greater frequency ranges,
portability, and open software architectures for ease in
customization. And since every customers' application requires
something a little different, we can consult with you on how you
might integrate third party software. This allows you to focus on
your application and process, thus saving you time and money. </strong></p>

quality, reduce development time, and enhance productivity by

<p><!--################ Body Starts Here ####################--> <strong>Designed to run in the Windows NT environment, the PC
7000 is a complete data acquisition system consisting of a PC
Host (any PC with built in ethernet), Input Modules in groups of
8 or 16 channels, and one Digital Signal Processor (DSP) per set
of input channels. Add the optional Output Module, Tachometer
Input, and Data Throughput disk; and you have one of the most
powerful up-to-date data acquisition systems available for the PC
today. </strong></p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><u>PC7000 Data Acquisition Front End</u></strong><u>
</u></h3>

<p><strong>This is where all analog data is captured, filtered,
converted to digital data, and processed, before being sent to
the host for display. Because most data reduction, such as
overlap processing, cross properties, and averaging, is performed
in the front-end, communication with the host PC is faster and
displays require less dedicated host time. </strong></p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><u>Ethernet Communication With Front
End</u></strong></h3>

<p align="left"><strong>Does your PC serve multiple purposes?
Thinwire Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) in stand-alone or clustered
networks provides the convenience of remote processing. Each PC
7000 has its own Ethernet address allowing you to perform remote
data acquisition and post-processing and still have networking
capabilities with other PC's and peripherals such as printers. </strong></p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><u>PC7000 Input Modules</u></strong></h3>

<p><strong>Built into the PC 7000 Multi-Channel FFT Analyzer are
either 16-channel Input Modules with 5 kHz capabilities or
8-channel Input Modules with 20 kHz capabilities. Each PC 7000
Chassis holds a maximum of 3 modules and multiple PC 7000 Chassis
can be slaved together to provide systems of up to 512 channels
or more. </strong></p>

<p><strong>The PC 7000 Multi-channel FFT Analyzer fits nicely on
a desktop next to your PC or is transportable to a remote
location and accessible via Ethernet connections. The PC 7000 can
also be operated by HP UNIX based workstations in networks where
workstations are available by downloading the appropriate UNIX
based analyzer software. </strong></p>

<p><strong>The PC 7000 input modules provide precise signal
conditioning which allow you to optimize the dynamic measurement
range for any given test. Voltage ranges of .010 to 20.0 V with
.375 dB step sizes are available as 176 discrete voltage range
settings. You realize over 13,000 discrete frequency ranges
between 1.4 Hz and their respective upper frequencies. You
improve the quality of each measurement. </strong></p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><u>PC7000 DSP (Digital Signal
Processor)</u></strong></h3>

<p><strong>All Auto and Cross Power spectral averaging is
supported, in addition to FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), IFFT
(Inverse Fourier Transform), octave calculations with A, B, C, or
no weighting. Calculations for 1/3 octave, single or double
integrate, and single or double differentiate are also performed
in the DSP. Because there is one DSP per PC 7000 chassis; as
additional chassis are added to a system, the real-time rate and
Throughput performance are not degradated. Auto and Cross Power
spectrums required for MIMO FRF calculations are performed by the
DSP as a standard capability. The resultant data can be saved as
binary or ASCII and transferred to your favorite Modal package. </strong></p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><u>PC7000 Throughput Disk Option</u></strong></h3>

<p><strong>Throughput operations can be performed simultaneously
with display and DSP Processing. Because there is one Throughput
disk per DSP, aggregate rates are the highest available. Both
fixed hard disks and removable optical disks are available for
data recording. Removable optical disks allow for easy data
archiving of raw time data. With the throughput option you
collect data once and play it back many times. Recorded data is
raw digitized time data. So you can play it back using different
averaging methods, weighting windows, and functions. Want more
flexibility? Try playing it back using overlap processing or a
different blocksize. Don't want to playback all the data every
time? Start and stop at the records of your choice. </strong></p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><u>PC7000 Signal Generator Option</u></strong></h3>

<p><strong>The Signal Generator uses a 12 Bit Signal DAC (Digital
to Analog Converter) to create the signal, followed by a 12 bit
Gain DAC to apply amplitude scaling. The Amplitude range is 10 mV
to 10 V. The frequency range is from DC to 20 kHz. If you have
more than one output generator, they may be set independently.
For those times when you need one or more output signals to
excite a structure, whether it is Pseudo-Random, Broadband
Random, Burst Random, Swept Sine, or any other excitation
technique, the Signal Generator option of the PC 7000 can easily
produce the signal required. The frequency and amplitude, as well
as the phase of the sine function can be accurately controlled
for each output channel, which is essential for any sine testing.
Sweeping in both linear and logarithmic modes is also supported.
Burst Random, which is a very efficient way of exciting a
structure using single or multi-point random signals, is
supported in a user-friendly manner. The burst’s on and off
times can be controlled easily to allow high quality of test data
to be acquired. </strong></p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><u>PC7000 Data Acquisition And
Analysis Software</u></strong></h3>

<p><strong>The PC 7000 Software Suite combines our 25 years of
software experience and &quot;know-how&quot; with the intimate
knowledge of the front-end hardware. This gives the PC 7000
real-time capabilities that are unsurpassed in the industry. From
fast parallel processing and data throughput recording, to a wide
variety of real-time displays and processing capabilities, the PC
7000 with its Software Suite provides the tools to measure and
analyze your noise and vibration problems so that you can
concentrate on solutions. </strong></p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><u>PC7000 Real Time Displays</u></strong></h3>

<p><strong>The PC7000 can display up to 16 separate display
windows with up to 8 overlay displays in each. Screen update
rates are dependent on the type of PC processor (486 or Pentium).
Regardless of the data path, throughput disk, spectral average
memory or number of displays requested, data can be displayed in
a variety of formats without degradation to the acquisition
speed. And, each display window may be moved, expanded; plots may
be re-sized, expanded; and two-dimensional cursors activated
during acquisition; again, without degradation of acquisition
speed. Choose from over 30 functions. Plot in XY, Complex,
Tracked, Waterfall, or Campbell Diagram. Use textures, colors,
and symbols to represent your data. </strong></p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><u>PC7000 Processing Operations</u></strong></h3>

<p><strong>Use arithmetic blocks for &quot;What if?&quot;
scenarios. Create, modify, or delete data from all or part of an
arithmetic block. Combine pieces of data from different blocks to
form a new block. Apply an arithmetic function to part or all of
the data. Run that data against your scenario. Compare the
scenarios by overlaying the different results into one plot
display. </strong></p>

<h3 align="center"><strong><u>PC7000 Transfer Of Data Files</u></strong></h3>

<p><strong>Write function files from time, frequency, or ordered
data. Read these files into the PC 7000 software for comparison
with newly acquired data. Write Universal file (type 58, Function
at Nodal DOF, ASCII format) from time, frequency, order, or
tracked data. Create ASCII text files by redirecting the software
output listings or the data calculated in batch routines. Move
ASCII files to other software products, i.e. speed sheets or word
processors for further analysis and report generation. </strong></p>

<h2 align="center"><strong><u>Rotating Machinery Analysis With
The PC7000</u></strong></h2>

<p><strong>When your primary concern is the behavior of rotating
machinery, the PC 7000 offers more than one method for obtaining
the necessary data. Each method optimizes the spectrum of
periodic data and for studying how spectral components vary with
machine speed. The PC 7000's Rotating Machinery Software Suite
provides the tools you need to acquire frequency, order, or
acoustic domain data in real-time. </strong></p>

<p><strong>The PC 7000 hardware tach circuitry of the DSP is used
to measure an RPM value for each block of data acquired. This
data can then be used to synthesize order spectra data by
translating the frequency axis into an order axis. </strong></p>

<p><strong>RPM Synthesis allows estimation of the RPM averaged
over each block of internally sampled data, based on a selected
data channel. This method is most suitable at slower speed
changes. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Frequency Synthesis allows frequency domain functions
to be displayed in real-time using an order domain synthesis
calculation. This option is selected with a single button in the
Function View menu. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Order Synthesis, from asynchronously (baseband)
sampled data, allows order domain functions to be displayed in
real-time using a frequency domain synthesis calculation. This
option is selected with a single button in the Function View
menu. </strong></p>

<p><strong>The order tracking table is an efficient way to setup
a table of all orders to be tracked for any or all of the
channels during acquisition. Orders of interest are measured and
accumulated on the DSP, instead of on the host. This capability
improves RPM resolution and allows much higher tracking speeds. </strong></p>

<p><strong>All speed domain functions may be plotted as a
function of RPM, time, vehicle speed (in MPH or km/hr with user
specified wheel diameter and transmission ratio), frequency in
Hz, a specified non-integer multiple of RPM, or a user defined
block of numbers. </strong></p>

<h2 align="center"><strong><u>Modal Analysis With The PC7000</u></strong><u>
</u></h2>

<p><strong>Concerned about the dynamic behavior of a structure?
Airplanes, automobiles, ships, buildings, bridges, and dams - all
are influenced by the critical response of the structure. All
modal testing begins by first acquiring the frequency response
functions of a structure while it is excited by one or more
external forces. With both SIMO and MIMO capabilities, the
multi-channel PC 7000 FFT front-end can easily capture accurate
measurements and process the data to fit any of your Modal
Analysis needs. </strong></p>

<p><strong>In addition to excitation techniques such as Impact,
Pseudo-Random, Broadband Random, Burst Random, and Swept Sine,
the PC 7000 calculates and displays time, auto and cross
spectrum, coherence, FRF and many other functions. With its
real-time, multi-trace display capability, the PC 7000 monitors
measurements in a variety of formats, such as Bode, Real &amp;
Imaginary, Nyquist, and Waterfall, to ensure that data of the
highest quality is acquired. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Save the data to a binary or Universal File Format for
transfer to STAR Modal Analysis&trade;, to I-DEAS Modal
Analysis&trade; or to your favorite Modal Analysis package. </strong></p>

<h2 align="center"><strong><u>Acoustic Analysis With The PC7000</u></strong><u>
</u></h2>

<p><strong>When noise and vibration are inseparable, take
advantage of Acoustic Analysis to solve airborne or water borne
noise problems. The PC 7000 provides the measurement data you
need from narrowband and real-time octave acquisition to perform
post-processing with your favorite Acoustic Analysis package. </strong></p>

<p><strong>From FFT processing, to calculating FRFs, Cross
Correlation's, Cross Spectral Density functions, 1/3 octave
bands, to finding the harmonics you need; the PC 7000 is fast,
flexible, and reliable. </strong></p>

<p><strong>The next time you need data for Acoustic Intensity
Analysis, start your project with the PC 7000, save your test
data to a binary or Universal File Format, and finish with STAR
Acoustic Intensity Analysis&trade;, I-DEAS Acoustic Intensity
Measurements&trade;, or your favorite Acoustic Analysis package. </strong></p>

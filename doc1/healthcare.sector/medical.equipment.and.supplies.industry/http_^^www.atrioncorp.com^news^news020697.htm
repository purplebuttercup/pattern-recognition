<blockquote>
    <p><strong>Muscle Shoals, Alabama (February 6, 1997)</strong>-ATRION
    Corporation (Nasdaq/NM - ATRI) today announced higher
    revenues and earnings for the year ended December 31, 1996.
    Net income for the year increased 21% to $6.5 million or
    $2.03 per share compared with $5.3 million or $1.67 per share
    in 1995, while revenues for 1996 advanced 69% to $136.0
    million compared with $80.4 million in the prior year. Per
    share amounts have been restated to reflect the three-for two
    stock split paid in December 1996.</p>
    <p>&quot;We are very pleased with Atrion's continued progress
    in 1996,&quot; said Jerry A Howard, Chairman of the Board,
    President and Chief Executive Officer. &quot;We have made
    important strides to diversify our revenue sources further,
    in both our medical and health care products business and in
    our pipeline services business.&quot;</p>
    <p>Howard pointed out that in May 1996, the Company acquired
    St. Petersburg, Florida-based Halkey-Roberts Corporation
    which strengthens Atrion&#146;s medical and health care
    products business. Halkey-Roberts develops and manufactures
    valves and medical components. With leading positions in
    several niche markets, Halkey-Roberts contributed
    approximately $9.5 million to Atrion&#146;s total revenues
    for 1996, nearly doubling the Company&#146;s medical and
    health care products business. The medical and health care
    products business accounted for 26% of the Company&#146;s
    operating income in 1996. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>According to Howard, the Company&#146;s pipeline and
    energy services business also posted strong results in 1996.
    Aided by colder weather during the year, the Company&#146;s
    natural gas pipelines transportation volumes increased 4% and
    natural gas sales volumes by Atrion&#146;s natural gas
    marketing company, ATEMCO, increased 22% over the previous
    year. In addition, during the year Atrion commenced operation
    of its new industrial gas pipeline, which transports gaseous
    oxygen. </p>
    <p>Howard noted that increased spot prices for natural gas
    during 1996 had a significant impact on the Company&#146;s
    revenues for the year. Revenues for the energy segment were
    up 65% to $114.4 million from $69.4 million in 1995 even
    though the Company&#146;s natural gas marketing volumes
    increased only 22%. </p>
    <p>Another significant accomplishment in 1996 was the final
    resolution of the Company&#146;s take-or-pay costs which were
    incurred by Atrion&#146;s interstate pipeline subsidiary,
    Alabama-Tennessee Natural Gas Company, during the 1980s. Net
    income for 1996 included a non-recurring after-tax gain of
    $300,000 or $.09 per share related to final adjustments made
    in this matter. </p>
    <p>While net income increased for the year, Howard said that
    earnings for the fourth quarter declined 10% to $1.2 million
    or $.36 per share compared with $1.3 million or $.41 per
    share in the year-earlier period. This decline reflected the
    impact of warmer weather on the Company&#146;s natural gas
    pipeline operations during the fourth quarter of 1996 versus
    the prior-year quarter and lower sales at Ryder International
    Corporation. Revenues for the period increased 54% to $36.0
    million compared with $23.4 million in the year-earlier
    period due to higher natural gas prices and the inclusion of
    Halkey-Roberts&#146; revenues. </p>
    <p>Howard also announced that the Company&#146;s Board of
    Directors had declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of
    $.20 per share. This dividend will be paid on March 3, 1997
    to shareholders of record as of February 20, 1997. </p>
    <p>Atrion Corporation supplies its customers with innovative
    medical and health care products and pipeline and energy
    services. For more information about the Company, visit

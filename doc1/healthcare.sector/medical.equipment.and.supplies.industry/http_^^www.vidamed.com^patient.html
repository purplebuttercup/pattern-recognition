This brochure is meant to help you understand <A HREF="#BPH">Benign Prostatic
Hyperplasia (BPH)</A> and the treatment option known as the TransUrethral
Needle Ablation, or TUNA Procedure. While this material will attempt to
answer some of your questions, remaining concerns can be best answered
by your physician. We encourage you to discuss those questions with your
urologist.</P>

<H4>What is BPH?</H4>

<P>Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or enlarged <!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#Prostate">prostate</A>
is a very common condition among older men. It is estimated that more than
30 million men suffer from urinary tract problems associated with BPH.
The incidence of BPH for men in their fifties is 30% which rises to 75%
by the age of 80 years. The prostate is a fibromuscular gland in the male
which lies immediately below the bladder. The normal prostate is approximately
the size of a walnut. Usually in the fourth decade of life, the prostate
begins to enlarge. Benign nodules grow around the tube-like <!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#Urethra">urethra</A>
that empties the bladder and passes through the center of the prostate.
This growth obstructs the flow of urine through the urethra. As a result
of this obstruction, men begin to experience <!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#Voiding">voiding</A>
problems including frequency (the need to void frequently), urgency (the
sudden sensation that you will wet yourself if you don't find a toilet),
nocturia (the need to get up to pass urine during the night), a weak stream,
a sensation of incomplete emptying of the bladder, or dripping after completing
urination.</P>

<P>A delay in treatment can have serious consequences, including complete
obstruction (acute retention), loss of bladder function, and in extreme
cases, kidney failure. Yet with medical attention, your symptoms may be
reduced to satisfactory levels. </P>

<P>A simple procedure called a <!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#DRE">digital
rectal examination</A> allows your doctor to determine whether the prostate
is enlarged. Blood tests, urine tests and other diagnostic procedures may
be done to find out more about your condition. If the tests suggest that
you need treatment, the TUNA Procedure is an option.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>The TUNA Procedure. </H4>

<P><!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://www.vidamed.com/procedure.html">The
TUNA procedure</A> is a minimally invasive treatment performed typically
in less than forty minutes in a day surgery or outpatient setting. The
procedure may be performed using a local anesthetic. A general or spinal
anesthesia may be used at the discretion of your doctor. During the procedure
a catheter is inserted through the penis to the level of the prostate.
Two very small needles are inserted into the prostate and low levels of
energy shrink the prostatic tissue that is obstructing the flow of urine.
The tissue shrinkage is confined to a well-defined area. Many patients
either read or watch TV during the time of treatment. Some patients may
require catheterization (a tube to draw urine) for a short period of time.
Most patients are able to return to their normal lifestyle within one day
of treatment and some patients return to their regular activities the same
day.</P>

<P>Difficulty urinating and discomfort from BPH can be treated. To learn
more about the TUNA Procedure as a treatment option, consult your urologist.</P>

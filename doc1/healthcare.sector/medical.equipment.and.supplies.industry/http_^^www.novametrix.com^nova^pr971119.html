        <P><STRONG>WALLINGFORD, CT., November 19, 1997</STRONG> - NOVAMETRIX
          MEDICAL SYSTEMS INC. (NASDAQ:
          <A HREF="http://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/multiquote2.asp?Symbol=+NMTX">NMTX</A>)
          today announced increased revenues and net income for both the second
          quarter and first six months of Fiscal 1998, on a comparable fully
          taxed basis.</P>
        
        <P>Net revenues for the second quarter of Fiscal 1998, which ended
          November 2, 1997 increased by 14% to $7,506,000 compared to net
          revenues of $6,591,000 reported for the second quarter of the prior
          fiscal year. Net income for the quarter ended November 2, 1997
          increased to $627,000 compared to $393,000 in the prior year and
          earnings per share increased by 40% to $0.07 per share compared to
          $0.05 per share, on a comparable fully taxed basis for the second
          quarter of Fiscal 1997, according to William J. Lacourciere, Chairman,
          President and Chief Executive Officer.</P>
        
        <P>In fiscal 1998, the Company began reporting on a fully taxed basis
          for financial reporting purposes and thus is not comparable to the
          prior year. Last year's reported results included a net tax benefit of
          $100,000 in each of the first two quarters, from the establishment of
          a deferred tax asset.</P>
        
        <P>Net revenues for the first six months of Fiscal 1998 also increased
          by 14% to $14,872,000 compared to $13,013,000 for the comparable
          period of the prior fiscal year. Net income for the six months ended
          November 2, 1997 increased to $1,151,000 compared to $755,000 in the
          prior year and earnings per share increased by 44% to $0.13 per share
          compared to $0.09 per share for the first half of the year ended
          October 27, 1996, again on a fully taxed basis as described above,
          according to Mr. Lacourciere.</P>
        
        <P>Commenting on the results, Mr. Lacourciere stated, &quot;Revenue and
          earnings for the second quarter and first half of Fiscal 1998 remain
          strong and on track with the Company's expectations. It is noteworthy
          that earnings growth rates of 40% continue while the Company has
          recognized an increase in fully diluted outstanding shares of 10% from
          8.3 million shares to 9.2 million shares compared to the first six
          months of last year. No appreciable changes in outstanding shares for
          earnings calculations are expected for the remainder of the fiscal
          year. We are also pleased to have eliminated all bank debt through
          positive cash flow and the conversion of some of the Company's &quot;A&quot;
          Warrants. Novametrix's balance sheet is the strongest in its history.&quot;</P>
        
        <P>He continued, &quot;We continue to invest heavily in R&amp;D and as
          reported earlier, Novametrix was named one of Connecticut's fifty
          fastest growing technology companies. Our current investment in a new
          technology, Non-Invasive Cardiac Output, also remains on track with
          positive test results reported from both animal and human clinical
          trials. Human clinical trials will be expanded over the next several
          months.&quot;</P>

        <P><CITE>This press release contains forward-looking statements that
          are based on management's estimates, assumptions and projections.
          Important factors that could cause results to differ materially from
          those expected by management include (a) the risk of rapid
          technological changes and advances including the development of new
          technologies which could make the Company's existing products
          technologically or economically obsolete, (b) challenges to the 
          validity of patents held by the Company or claims that the Company's
          technology infringes other patents, (c) extreme competition in the
          electronic medical instrumentation industry including competition from
          companies with greater financial resources than the Company, (d) more
          stringent government regulation of medical device manufacturers and
          (e) consolidation in the hospital industry and the establishment of
          purchasing organizations among groups of hospitals, which could result
          in reduced demand or reduction in the rate of growth of demand for the
          Company's products and in reduced profit margins. No assurance can be
          provided as to actual future financial results.</CITE></P>

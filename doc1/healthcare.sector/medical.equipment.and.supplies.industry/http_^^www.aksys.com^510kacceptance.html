FILING OF AKSYS PHD(TM) SYSTEM ACCEPTED BY FDA FOR FORMAL REVIEW</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>LIBERTYVILLE, Ill., July 17, 1996</strong>
-- Aksys, Ltd. (Nasdaq-NNM: AKSY) today announced that the
Company has received telephone notification from the U.S. Food
&amp; Drug Administration (FDA) that the Section 510(k) premarket
notification filing for the Aksys PHD(TM) Personal Hemodialysis
System has been accepted for formal review. By so doing, the
agency has determined that the data and documentation supplied
with the submission are adequate to warrant such a review. This
does not provide any assurance that 510(k) clearance will be
obtained and the FDA can still request additional data, including
clinical data, during the review process. &quot;We are very
pleased that the FDA has decided to accept our 510(k) application
for review,&quot; stated Lawrence H.N. Kinet, Chairman and CEO of
Aksys. &quot;We look forward to further meetings with the FDA as
the Aksys PHD system moves through the regulatory process.&quot;
In April and in May the FDA had declined to file the Aksys
application placing it on administrative hold and had requested
additional data in support of the filing. Aksys responded to this
request by providing a supplement and in late May, met with
personnel at the agency to discuss the application resulting in
the current decision to file it for review. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Aksys, Ltd. is developing hemodialysis products
and services for patients suffering from kidney failure. These
products and services include the Company's lead product in
development, the Aksys PHD(TM) Personal Hemodialysis System
designed to improve clinical outcomes of patients, reducing
mortality, morbidity and the associated high cost of patient
care. The PHD approach to the treatment of kidney dialysis
patients is simple: more dialysis is better than less, daily
treatment is better than less frequent, and the patient's home is
the best location for a chronic therapy. </font></p>

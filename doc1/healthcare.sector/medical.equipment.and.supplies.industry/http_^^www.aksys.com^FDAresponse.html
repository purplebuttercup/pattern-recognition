Response to 510(K) Filing</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>LIBERTYVILLE, Ill., Sept. 20, 1996</strong>--
Aksys, Ltd. (NASDAQ:AKSY) today announced that it has received
written notification from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) that additional data will be required as part of the FDA
review process to establish the safety and effectiveness of the
Aksys PHD(TM) Personal Hemodialysis System, including data from
clinical studies in which end stage renal disease patients are
treated using the Aksys PHD(TM) system. The FDA also requested
that the Company address a number of issues regarding the design
and operation of the system prior to conducting clinical studies.
The FDA has invited the Company to meet to discuss the scope and
timing of the clinical studies. Given that it would not be
possible to perform such studies and respond to the FDA's request
within the standard 30-day 510(k) response period, the Company's
current 510(k) premarket notification filing has been withdrawn
by the FDA and the Company intends to make a new filing once the
additional data can be provided. The FDA indicated that if the
Company submits the requested information, the submission will be
considered and processed as a new 510(k) filing. &quot;Although
we continue to believe that clinical data should not be required
for a device such as ours, we knew a request for clinical data
was a possibility and we have always made that very clear. We
intend to work diligently to respond to the FDA's request,&quot;
stated Lawrence H.N. Kinet, Chairman and CEO of Aksys.
&quot;Until we have an opportunity to work with the FDA to agree
upon the parameters of the clinical studies, we will not be able
to accurately assess the impact of this development on the timing
reflected in our current business plan.&quot; The Company is also
pursuing regulatory approval for the Aksys PHD(TM) System in
Europe, Japan and other countries. Aksys, Ltd. is developing
hemodialysis products and services for patients suffering from
kidney failure. These products and services include the Company's
lead product in development, the Personal Hemodialysis (PHD)
System, designed to improve clinical outcomes of patients,
reducing mortality, morbidity and the associated high cost of
patient care. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong><u>INVESTMENT
HIGHLIGHTS</u></strong><u> </u></font></p>

<p align="left">As the only vertically integrated provider of
shockwave therapy that manufactures, sells, services
lithotripters, and provides lithotripsy on fee for procedure
basis, Medstone International can place its large ticket
equipment into service at a fraction of the cost of its
competitors who must purchase lithotripsy equipment from outside
sources, including Medstone, before placing it into service with
a medical group. Medstone has transitioned from solely a
manufacturer of lithotripters to a service company providing
lithotripsy on a fee per procedure basis. Approximately 80% of
Medstone's revenue is generated from recurring sources (procedure
fees, fee for service and maintenance contracts.) Medstone
consistently produces pre-tax margins in excess of 30%. </p>

<p align="left">Medstone places its equipment into service with
medical groups on either a fixed-site or mobile basis. In 1996,
Medstone owned- equipment in service, 12 mobile units and two
fixed sites, performed 4,418 procedures, an increase of 43%, at
an average fee of $1,584 for each procedure. </p>

<p align="left"><strong><u>Non-Recurring vs. Recurring Revenue</u></strong></p>

<p align="left">Since inception, in addition to generating
non-recurring lithotripter manufacturing revenue, Medstone has
always focused on strengthening its sources of recurring revenue:
(1) fee-for-service; (2) per procedure licensing fees; and (3)
maintenance fees. This was in recognition of the fact that sales
of large ticket equipment can be erratic and need to be balanced
with more consistent sources of revenue. Recurring revenue for FY
1996 has grown at an annualized rate of 21.3% from 1994 and now
represents 82% of total revenue, up from 72% two years ago. </p>

<p align="left">Under the leadership of new CEO, David Radlinski,
Medstone spun off two seedling non-lithotripsy subsidiaries to
its shareholders in late 1995 in order to focus on the highly
profitable core business: Endocare, manufactures equipment and
devices to treat urologic soft tissue diseases and has traded as
high as $5, and Urogen, a developmental stage company which is
developing pharmaceuticals to treat prostate cancer and will be
available for trading in late 1997. Settlement was also reached
with respect to a shareholder lawsuit that has lingered since
1989. While these events had a negative impact on 1996 results,
they also position Medstone to benefit in 1997 as a result of
these actions. </p>

<p align="left"><strong><u>U.S. Procedures-Medstone Equipment</u></strong><u>
</u></p>

<p align="left">Medstone's market share in the U.S. continues to
grow rapidly when measured in terms of procedures performed on
equipment-owned and operated by Medstone. These numbers represent
the vast opportunity potential for the company to expand its
sales and product line. </p>

<p align="left">Medstone has substantial cash, no long-term debt,
high pre-tax margins, and substantial positive cash flow. As a
percentage of revenue, Medstone's after tax earnings are greater
than 20%. </p>

<p align="left"><a href="medcom97.htm"><font color="#0000FF"><strong><i><u>THE
COMPANY</u></i></strong></font></a><u> </u></p>

<p align="left">Medstone International was formed in 1984 to
develop proprietary technology in the field of non-surgical
shockwave therapy. The system was approved for commercial sale in
the United States. by the Food and Drug Administration in 1988.
The company markets its products worldwide with units installed
in China, Japan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Israel, and the
United States. Sales and service is provided directly by the
company in the U.S. and through distributors outside the United
States. To date, the company has sold 82 machines worldwide, of
which 50 were sold domestically. </p>

<p align="left">Medstone receives non-recurring revenue from the
sale of equipment, including lithotripters and feature upgrades.
A substantially larger portion of revenue is generated through
recurring sources, including: a license fee each time any
domestic machine performs a procedure, revenue from the
fee-for-service program provided in Medstone owned and operated
mobile vans, and maintenance contracts. It is Medstone's plan to
continue the expansion of recurring revenue sources. </p>

<p align="left">The company has become the industry expert in
providing lithotripsy procedures. Their expertise is derived from
both its (a) technological advantage as a vertically integrated
manufacturer and service provider, and (b) its experience
advantage, given that it has been studying and performing
shockwave lithotripsy for over 12 years. </p>

<p align="left"><a href="medpro97.htm"><font color="#0000FF"><strong><i><u>THE
PRODUCTS</u></i></strong></font></a><u> </u></p>

<p align="left">The Medstone International STS is presently used
to treat kidney stones, without invasive surgery. A series of
shockwaves are created outside the patient's body and focused to
travel through water-based fluids until they enter the body and
disintegrate the stone. Each successive shockwave serves to
further break apart the kidney stone into smaller particles until
they are small enough to be passed in the patient's urine. A
treatment typically requires 1200-1600 shockwaves in a procedure
which lasts 45 to 60 minutes. The Company received its pre-market
approval (PMA) from the FDA in 1988, authorizing the device for
treating patients with kidney stones. </p>

<p align="left">In addition to the shockwave generator, the
Medstone STS's components include a customized X-ray table on
which the patient lies horizontally with his or her kidney
positioned above the shockwave generator, a computer, an X-ray
system, an ultrasound system, and an electrocardiogram (ECG)
monitor which allows the computer to synchronize the shockwaves
with phases of the patient's heartbeat. </p>

<p align="left">Medstone has developed and copyrighted all the
software that controls the STS. Medstone has also developed and
manufactures its own disposable components for use with the STS:
Electrodes, used to produce electrical sparks in the shockwave
generator, and, a disposable coupling bag containing the fluids
necessary for the transmission of the shockwaves. One complete
set of the supplies is normally used for each patient procedure. </p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong><i><u>OUTLOOK FOR
GROWTH</u></i></strong><u> </u></font></p>

<p align="left">Kidney stones affect about 2.5% of the population
and are particularly prevalent in men between 45 and 64 years
old. This segment of the U.S. population is projected to grow 36%
(from 25 million in 1995 to 34 million in 2005) in the next ten
years. Since this is the country's most rapidly growing
population segment, the growth in demand for lithotripsy
procedures seems to be accelerating from 2%-4% annually to 4%-6%.
A study prepared by The American Lithotripsy Society indicated
approximately 175,000 lithotripsy procedures were performed in
1993, up from 126,000 in 1988. Approximately 180,000 procedures
were performed in 1995. </p>

<p align="left">The industry is very fragmented and offers many
opportunities for growth through consolidation. Approximately 65%
of the machines are owned by individual medical groups which
usually own only one or two machines. </p>

<p align="left">Medstone has few competitors, and it is the only
company that both manufactures and services lithotripters.
Medstone profitably competes in the most competitive regions of
the United States. Fee per procedures are much lower in
Medstone's geographic service areas than in other parts of the
country. The company has eliminated its historical impediments to
growth, and now can focus on growing through acquisitions and
increasing recurring revenues. Management attention had been
diverted by a 1988 shareholder lawsuit that was finally settled
in June 1996 for $5.5 million and in December 1995 two
subsidiaries, Endocare and Urogen, were spun off to shareholders.
</p>

<p align="left">New markets the company is entering have much
higher compensation rates per procedure than in its existing
markets. Currently, revenue per procedure has averaged $1,600,
while in many parts of the U.S. the procedures average $4,000.
The company is particularly active in the western U. S., but it
is expanding its operating routes in include Texas, Florida and
the Northeast.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong><i><u>BUSINESS
STRATEGY</u></i></strong><u> </u></font></p>

<p align="left">Medstone's primary strategy is to be the leading
provider of lithotripsy procedures in the United States and in
selected locations abroad. The company is pursuing a
multi-pronged growth plan during 1997 which entails: </p>

<p align="left">Capturing increased efficiencies among the
Medstone-owned lithotripsy machines already in the field by
enhancing marketing efforts aimed directly at hospitals and
urology groups and strategically planning mobile routes so as to
increase the number of procedures performed per location. </p>

<p align="left">Selectively acquiring related businesses or
physician groups that compliment Medstone's strategic initiatives
and expand its geographic reach. </p>

<p align="left">Expanding international sales and services in
high-growth markets by leveraging the company's relationships and
experience. </p>

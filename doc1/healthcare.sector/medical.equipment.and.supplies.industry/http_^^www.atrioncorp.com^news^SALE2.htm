<P><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">ARAB, Alabama (May 30, 1997)   Atrion Corporation (Nasdaq/NM - ATRI)
announced today that it has completed the sale of its natural gas pipeline and
marketing subsidiaries to Midcoast Energy Resources, Inc. (AMEX:MRS)  for
approximately $39.4 million in cash.  The sale, which was approved by Atrion's
stockholders at the Company's annual meeting held yesterday,  is part of Atrion's
efforts to redeploy its assets in higher growth areas like the medical products
industry. </FONT></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">	Jerry A. Howard, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We
believe the proceeds from the sale of our natural gas businesses will provide a
strong foundation from which to launch our plans to acquire other companies
involved in the medical products industry.  Our intent is to focus on operations that
offer significant synergies with our existing medical-products operations."  Howard
noted that the Company will record a gain of about $17 million in the second quarter
of 1997 from the sale of its natural gas pipeline and marketing subsidiaries.  As a
result of this gain, Atrion estimates that its book value per share has increased to
approximately  $16 per share from the first quarter 1997 level of about $11 per
share.</FONT></P>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><u>CUSTOMER SERVICE</u></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4">At Medstone International we're committed to fully
support the product we sell.</font></p>

<p>Medstone International is dedicated to advancing medical technology by developing and
manufacturing state-of-the-art instrumentation for shockwave therapy devices. We are
equally committed to making sure all Medstone Shockwave Therapy systems continue to
operate within factory specifications once installed. Even the finest equipment with the
most comprehensive preventative maintenance can malfunction occasionally. To minimize this
inconvenience for you and your patients, our commitment goes far beyond a quick response
to your call.</p>

<p>Our service commitment is as complete as our equipment design, our Customer Service
training, our on-site parts supply, and our Comprehensive Customer Protection Plan (CCPP).
It is our <strong>full</strong> support for your system's optimum operation capability.</p>

<p><strong>SYSTEMS DESIGNED FOR EASY SERVICING</strong></p>

<p>Our system was designed using replacement modules to simplify on-site maintenance.
Whether we are performing routine service or correcting an unexpected problem, we can do
it with little disruption to your patient scheduling. This reduced service time is a
further benefit to you.</p>

<p><strong>EXPERIENCED, FACTORY-TRAINED CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES</strong></p>

<p>Our dedicated Customer Service Representatives help keep your system operating at
maximum performance. They are technical professionals with experience in the repair of
medical equipment.</p>

<p>At our Training Center, each Customer Service Representative receives comprehensive
technical training and hands-on experience. Regular seminars are conducted by our
highly-trained technical staff with an average of 10 years experience.</p>

<p><strong>NON-MEDSTONE SERVICE (International)</strong></p>

<p>It is often impractical to service a remote or foreign system from our manufacturing
site or by a dedicated Customer Service Representative. Medstone will train your in-house
biomedical engineers or local service organization to maintain your system. Because of its
modular design, our 24-hour technical support, and several on-site spares, your system
will exhibit the same phenomenal high up time that local users come to expect.</p>

<p><strong>ON SITE INVENTORY (National and Internationally)</strong></p>

<p>Several levels of spares are available to keep on site. Although only a few high-stress
parts account for 80 percent of our parts usage, more complete kits will assure up times
of 95 percent or greater.</p>

<p><strong>TECHNICAL SUPPORT BACKUP</strong></p>

<p>Our Customer Service Representatives have the full support of our Corporate Technical
Support Department and a comprehensive technical staff including:

<ul>
  <li>A central 24 hour telephone dispatch service</li>
  <li>Telephone technical support</li>
  <li>Customer Service Representatives</li>
  <li>Service Manual publication</li>
  <li>Repair Center</li>
  <li>Logistics Coordinator</li>
  <li>Service Management</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>CONTINUED HIGH-QUALITY SYSTEM PERFORMANCE (National)</strong></p>

<p>We provide comprehensive, routine servicing with a Comprehensive Customer Protection
Plan. This will insure optimum system availability for maximum patient throughput.
Preventative maintenance care also means fewer conflicts with patient scheduling.</p>

<p>All labor, parts, and travel costs are included on the Comprehensive Customer
Protection Plan so you can easily budget maintenance expenses.</p>

<p>Our Field Service Reports (FSR) help you keep an accurate log of equipment maintenance,
a valuable tool in assuring hospital accreditation.</p>

<p>We provide a minimum of 12 scheduled Preventative Maintenance services a year.</p>

<p><strong>GUARANTEED RESPONSE TIME (National)</strong></p>

<p>As part of our warranty and full service plans, Medstone Customer Service Department
will guarantee 15 minute response time by telephone and a Customer Service Representative
will be on site (mobile systems home base) if a repair is needed on your system within 4
hours. We also provide <strong>24 hour MEDSERV Hot line number</strong> maintained by a
Medstone Customer Service employee 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>

<p><strong>By purchasing a Medstone STS, you are making an investment in the most advanced
lithotripsy instrumentation available today. Naturally, you will want the most benefit
from your investment, both now and in the future.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Medstone Customer Service Department is dedicated to insure your investment is
operating at an optimum performance level at all times.</strong></p>

<p><strong>At Medstone International, <u>We Set The Service Standards</strong></u></p>

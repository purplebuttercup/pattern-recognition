MILLION AGREEMENT<br>
TO SELL NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS<br>
</b></font><strong>------------<br>
</strong><font face="Arial"><b>PLANS TO USE PROCEEDS FOR
STRATEGIC EXPANSION<br>
OF MEDICAL PRODUCTS BUSINESS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Muscle Shoals, Alabama (March 19, 1997) --
Atrion Corporation (Nasdaq/NM:ATRI) announced today that it has
entered into a definitive agreement to sell its natural gas
pipeline and marketing operations to Midcoast Energy Resources,
Inc. (AMEX:MRS) for approximately $39.4 million in cash, subject
to certain post-closing adjustments. The closing of the
transaction is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions as
well as the notification and waiting period provisions of the
Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and to approval by
Atrion's stockholders at the annual meeting of stockholders
anticipated to be held in May or June. The transaction is not
contingent on financing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Since the early 1990s, as the market for
the Company's natural gas services has grown more competitive,
Atrion has allocated substantial resources to the development and
growth of businesses outside its traditional natural gas
operations. Over the past three years, the Company has invested
more than $26 million in companies engaged in the development,
manufacturing and marketing of medical and related products.
Through these acquisitions the Company has added executives with
considerable expertise, and has gained significant experience, in
the medical products industry. While implementing this
diversification program, the Company has maintained its natural
gas operations in the face of efforts by competitors and
customers to bypass the Company's pipeline systems and
competitive pressures that have resulted in contract
renegotiations and discounting. After a thorough review of
alternatives relating to continued operation, possible expansion
or disposition of its natural gas operations, the Board of
Directors of the Company, on the recommendation of management,
has concluded that a sale of the Company's natural gas pipeline
and marketing operations offers the greatest potential for
maximizing stockholder value by providing the Company with
financial liquidity for future acquisitions outside the natural
gas industry. The Board of Directors believes that both the
timing of the transaction and the price to be paid by Midcoast
are attractive and that for those and other reasons the
transaction is in the best interest of the Company and its
stockholders. In connection with its decision to approve the
transaction, at its March 18, 1997 meeting the Board of Directors
received an opinion from Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc.
that, subject to the matters set forth in such opinion, the
consideration to be received by the Company in the transaction is
fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Jerry A. Howard, Chairman of the Board,
President and Chief Executive Officer of Atrion, remarked,
&quot;The agreement with Midcoast represents a significant
opportunity to accelerate the strategic shift of Atrion's
business toward medical products. Our actions to diversify the
Company's business beyond the natural gas industry and build a
more growth-oriented corporate structure began more than three
years ago. The acquisition in 1994 of a medical products company
demonstrated Atrion's identification of the medical industry as
an attractive target market for our resources. During 1995 we
acquired exclusive worldwide rights to a specialized medical
catheter system, and we expanded our medical-related operations
further in 1996 through the acquisition of a manufacturer of
valves and other medical components. The operating income from
our medical products business has doubled over the past three
years from $1.2 million in 1994 to $2.4 million in 1996. As we
have expanded our medical products operations, we have continued
to maintain our pipeline and energy marketing operations which we
have now agreed to sell to Midcoast.&quot; Howard noted that the
subsidiaries being sold represented approximately 36% of
Atrion&#146;s net book value of $34.4 million at December 31,
1996 and generated approximately 72% of Atrion&#146;s operating
income of $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1996. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Mr. Howard stated, &quot;This transaction
clearly represents a major redeployment of the Company&#146;s
capital. We plan to use the proceeds of the sale principally for
acquisitions of medical product lines and companies involved in
the development, manufacturing and marketing of medical products.
Our intent is to focus on operations that offer significant
synergies with our existing medical products operations. We
anticipate moving prudently but as expeditiously as possible to
accomplish the objective of adding assets that will enable us to
build long-term value for our stockholders.&quot; After the
closing of the transaction, Atrion will continue to own Atrion
Medical Products, Inc. (formerly Ryder International Corporation)
and Halkey-Roberts Corporation, which comprise the Company&#146;s
medical products segment, and AlaTenn Pipeline Company, Inc.,
which owns the Company&#146;s gaseous oxygen pipeline. While the
Company has identified certain market segments and businesses
within such segments with which it might be interested in
discussing a stock or asset acquisition, business combination or
other similar type of transaction, no agreements exist with
respect to any such proposed transaction. Raymond James &amp;
Associates is also assisting the Company in the identification of
possible acquisition candidates and in the analysis of possible
acquisitions in the medical products industry. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">While the agreement with Midcoast provides
that the transaction is to be closed on or before July 3, 1997,
the Company anticipates that if the transaction is approved by
the stockholders, the closing will take place as soon as
practicable after the annual meeting. At the closing, the Company
is to receive cash of approximately $39.4 million and is to
transfer to Midcoast all of the capital stock of
Alabama-Tennessee Natural Gas Company, Tennessee River Intrastate
Gas Company, Inc. and AlaTenn Energy Marketing Company, Inc. The
purchase price is subject to certain adjustments subsequent to
closing which will be based on the final determination of the
consolidated net book value of the subsidiaries being sold. In
addition, the Company may receive deferred payments of as much as
$250,000 per year for an eight-year period, beginning in 1999. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Howard added, &quot;We understand that
Midcoast's plans are to retain the personnel of the natural gas
pipeline and marketing operations. This is an attractive aspect
of the transaction and will help ensure that the individuals who
have contributed to the efficiency of these operations will
continue to have viable career paths.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In a separate action, the Board of
Directors of Atrion has declared a dividend of $0.20 per share,
payable June 1, 1997 to stockholders of record on May 20, 1997.
The Board of Directors also determined that, commencing with the
dividend payable on September 1, 1997, the quarterly dividend
will be paid at the rate of $0.10 per share rather than at the
current rate of $0.20 per share. The quarterly dividend will be
reduced regardless of whether the proposed sale is consummated.
Mr. Howard commented, &quot;The Board of Directors concluded that
if we were to retain our natural gas operations we should reduce
the dividend to help us meet the funding requirements of both of
our business segments. If the proposed sale of our natural gas
operations is consummated, the reduction will bring our dividend
more into line with other companies in the medical products
industry and provide more resources for the Company to invest in
its ongoing business.&quot; The Board of Directors will continue
to review the dividend policy on a regular basis in the future. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Atrion Corporation, formerly AlaTenn
Resources, Inc., supplies its customers with innovative medical
products and pipeline and energy services.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Midcoast is a Houston-based pipeline
company with offices in Corpus Christi, Texas; Topeka, Kansas;
Tuscaloosa, Alabama; and Pachuta, Mississippi. Midcoast gathers,
transports, processes and markets natural gas and other petroleum
products, and with this transaction will have more than 45
company-owned pipelines.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Statements contained in this press release
concerning the anticipated use of proceeds from the transaction
and the possibility of future growth in the medical products
industry are forward-looking statements that are subject to a
number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results
to differ materially from the statements made. Such factors
include the ability of the parties to complete the transaction
and risks associated with the Company's ability to identify and
consummate acquisitions in the medical products industry.</font></p>

PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS PLAN</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Lincolnshire, IL, October 30, 1996 &#150;</b>
Aksys, Ltd. (Nasdaq/NNM: AKSY), a leader in the development of
personal hemodialysis products and services, today announced that
its Board of Directors, at an October 28, 1996 meeting, adopted a
stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend to be made to
stockholders of record on November 8, 1996 of one preferred share
purchase right on each outstanding share of the Company&#146;s
common stock. Each such right will entitle a stockholder to buy
one one-thousandth of a share of a new series of junior
participating preferred stock for an exercise price of $85.00.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The stockholder rights plan was adopted to
preserve for the stockholders of the Company the long-term value
of the Company in the event of a takeover of the Company or the
purchase of a significant block of common stock of the Company
and to protect the Company and its stockholders against coercive
takeover tactics.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The rights will become exercisable only if a
person acquires, or announces a tender offer for, 15% or more of
the Company&#146;s common stock (with certain exceptions). Prior
to the time the rights become exercisable, the rights will be
evidenced by the certificates representing shares of common stock
of the Company and will be transferable only in connection with
the transfer of shares of common stock. If a person acquires 15%
of the Company&#146;s common stock, each right will entitle the
holder thereof to purchase for an exercise price of $85.00
(subject to adjustment) shares of the Company&#146;s common stock
having a market value of twice such exercise price, valued as of
the date of occurrence of such triggering event, subject to the
right of the Company to exchange the rights for common stock of
the Company on a one-for-one basis.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Company will be entitled to redeem the
rights at $0.01 per right at any time before public disclosure
that a 15% position has been acquired. The rights will expire on
October 28, 2006, unless previously redeemed or exercised. The
distribution of the rights will not be a taxable event to
stockholders.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Aksys, Ltd. is developing hemodialysis products
and services for patients suffering from kidney failure. These
products and services include the Company&#146;s lead product in
development, the Aksys PHD</font><font size="3" face="Symbol">ä</font><font
size="3"> Personal Hemodialysis System, designed to improve
clinical outcomes of patients, reducing mortality, morbidity and
the associated high cost of patient care. The PHD approach to the
treatment of kidney dialysis patients is simple: more dialysis is
better than less; daily treatment is better than less frequent
treatment; and alternate sites, such as the patient&#146;s home
or a self-care clinic, are preferable locations to perform
chronic therapy.</font></p>

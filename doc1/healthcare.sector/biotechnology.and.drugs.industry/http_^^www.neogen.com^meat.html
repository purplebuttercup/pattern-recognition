<U><STRONG>THE MEAT AND POULTRY MARKET</STRONG>
<br></U>
<FONT SIZE=+1><p>People have become increasingly aware of the dangers foodborne bacteria
can cause in meat products. One of the most serious threats is the deadly
<i>E. coli</i> O157:H7, a bacteria most often associated with hamburger.
Other bacteria includes: Salmonella, camplybacter, Listeria and shigella.
<br></p>

<p>These types of pathogens have been identified by the Center for Disease
Control as the cause of illness in 6.5 million people, resulting in over
9,000 deaths in the US each year. This implication is impacting the industry
and businesses in ways that have both short and long-term effects.
<br><p>

<p>Verification testing of processed meat and poultry will be required
for food safety assurance, but more importantly, it is necessary to protect
your company and customer's business from the economic ramifications which
relate to the presence, or perceived presence of foodborne pathogens in
the products you market.

<hr>

<p>Completing the trio of therapeutic programs ongoing at the company is its vaccine
research, which has led to the development of a novel strategy for the prevention or
treatment of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis leads to heart disease and stroke, among
other conditions, and is one of the leading causes of death in the Western world and
Japan.</p>

<p>The vaccine stimulates the production of antibodies to cholesteryl ester transfer
protein (CETP), which mediates the balance between high-density lipoprotein (HDL, or
so-called &quot;good&quot; cholesterol) and low density lipoprotein (LDL, or
&quot;bad&quot; cholesterol). The antibodies inhibit the activity of CETP, thus decreasing
the plasma levels of LDL. As high levels of LDL and low levels of HDL are associated with
an increased risk of atherosclerosis, the vaccine is expected to reduce the risk of that
disease. In preclinical studies, presented at a major conference in 1996, rabbits treated
with the CETP vaccine exhibited increased LDL levels and significantly fewer
atherosclerotic lesions in their blood vessels as compared with an untreated control group
that displayed no increase in HDL and significant lesions.</p>

<p>To date, T Cell Sciences has received three separate Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) grants from the National Institutes of Health totaling $878,000 to advance this
research. The company is now in the final stages of optimizing the vaccine in order to
identify the appropriate candidate for further development.</p>

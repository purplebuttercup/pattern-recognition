Based on preliminary results,no clinically significant adverse effects have been reported. TheCompany anticipates that the final audit of the Phase I data will becompleted by April 1997. Assuming successful completion of the PhaseI clinical trial, the Company intends to conduct concurrent butseparate Phase II and Phase III clinical trials for differentcardiology and radiology indications.<P>In addition to the diagnosis of CAD and PVD, the Company intendsto pursue the use of MS-325 for additional clinical indications,including thrombosis, commonly referred to as "blood clots." EPIXbelieves that MRI with MS-325 could eliminate the need for selectedultrasound and nuclear medicine studies of thrombosis whileproviding, noninvasively, diagnostic information which is clinicallyequivalent to that provided by peripheral X-ray angiography.<P>Based on the physical properties of MS-325 and preclinicalstudies, MS- 325 may also have potential application as part of anoninvasive imaging procedure that would enable physicians todiscriminate between malignant and benign breast masses in patientswith indeterminate mammograms or palpable lumps. Another potentialapplication for MS-325 in the diagnosis of breast cancer is indefining the size of malignant lesions. EPIX believes that an MRIbreast exam using MS-325 could allow better determination ofeligibility for breast-conserving therapy.<P><CENTER><HR>&copy; 1997, EPIX Medical, Inc.<BR><P><CENTER>E-mail us at<A HREF="mailto:info@epixmed.com">info@epixmed.com</A></CENTER><P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></BODY></HTML>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="MS Sans Serif">Avigen is actively seeking to develop
long-term strategic collaborations with pharmaceutical companies that can provide funding
for research and development activities and clinical trials for potential products of the
sponsor. </font><font size="2">. </font><font size="2" face="MS Sans Serif">We also are
looking for new applications to disease, and for new gene sequences to deliver. We and our
collaborators have delivered over thirty different genes, so we can do custom development
programs on applications that would fit the product lines and/or research interests of
most pharmaceutical companies.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="MS Sans Serif">Our excitement about our system rests on a
combination of animal and production run data. Avigen&#146;s AAV delivery system is
unusual in its ability to achieve efficient delivery of a wide variety of genes to many
different target tissues, including muscle, liver, CNS, and skin. Product would be
directly administered in a vial/syringe format familiar to the medical community. Our
system has repeatedly demonstrated prolonged therapeutic response after a single
injection; up to eighteen months in one case, combined with a dose-response relationship.
Our vectors have no viral genes, and our production process is free of infectious
contaminant viruses. Both helper viruses and wild-type AAV viruses have been removed from
the process. For more information see <a href="CorporatePartners_2.htm">Additional
Information on Avigen&#146;s AAV delivery system.</a> We currently have the production
capability to move into large animal experimentation and Phase I clinicals. </font></p>

Maurer, Vice President of Business Development, at (510) 748-7103, (510) 748-7155 (fax),

<hr>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">T Cell Sciences aims to discover and develop novel
small molecule immunoregulators that treat immune system, inflammatory and infectious
diseases by stimulating or suppressing the immune response. Based on the company&#146;s
significant understanding of T cell-mediated immune responses and signal transduction
pathways within lymphocytes, T Cell Sciences has developed:</font>

<dir>
  <li><font face="Times,Times New Roman">High throughput assays to identify both
    immunosuppressive and stimulatory compounds</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Broad-based mechanism of action assays to identify
    specific targets within pathways</font></li>
</dir>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Screening for small molecule immunoregulators using
these assays is an ongoing drug discovery program at T Cell Sciences, conducted in
partnership with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who provide drug development
resources and/or compound libraries. The company has to date established access to
synthetic compound and natural product libraries for screening through relationships with
corporate partners ArQule and Repligen. In addition, T Cell Sciences has developed
expertise in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, as well as animal models to
demonstrate <i>in vivo</i> efficacy of its drug leads.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">The immunosuppressive molecules that T Cell has
identified through this program have potential as treatments for transplant rejection,
autoimmune disorders and inflammatory diseases. Immunostimulatory compounds discovered by
the company are useful in the treatment of cancers, infectious diseases and as adjuvants
that increase vaccine effectiveness.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman"><b>Economic Opportunities</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Significant economic opportunities exist for small
molecule drugs that suppress or stimulate the immune response. Immunosuppressive drugs are
currently used to prevent or treat transplant rejection or to treat chronic diseases such
as rheumatoid arthritis that are associated with autoimmune disorders and/or inflammation.
While current immunosuppressives such as cyclosporin A and FK506 are effective for certain
indications such as organ transplantation, the toxicity of these drugs dramatically limits
their market application in less life-threatening settings that require chronic drug use
(e.g. as treatments for autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis). Current
worldwide sales of immunosuppressives are well in excess of $1 billion annually; experts
estimate that the market potential for immunosuppressive drugs for use in transplantation
alone will grow to $5 billion worldwide by 2010.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Immunostimulants that boost immune responses against
disease could provide new treatments for AIDS and other infectious diseases and cancer, as
well as provide new adjuvants to increase the effectiveness of vaccines. Applications for
immunostimulants extend to animal as well as human health.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman"><b>Platform Technology</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">T Cell Sciences has created a platform technology
for discovery of small molecule drugs that modulate key immune system pathways. The
company&#146;s discovery program is based on the use of several proprietary, stable lines
of T cells that are suitable for high-throughput screening for immunoregulatory compounds
that stimulate or suppress T cell activation. The T Cell lines are activated specifically
through cell surface receptors (TCRs) using the company&#146;s proprietary anti-TCR
monoclonal antibodies. With this system, T Cell Sciences can access all potential targets
along the signal transduction pathway leading to T cell activation, ensuring that any
compound that regulates activation at a point along that pathway will be identified.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="smir1.gif" width="499" height="317"></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">T Cell Sciences believes that its receptor-mediated
screening assays are superior in several ways to most other T cell activation assays:</font>

<dir>
  <li><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Most other T cell assays activate T cells chemically,
    at a point in the activation pathway downstream from the TCR. Thus, immunoregulators that
    act at upstream signal transduction steps are missed by those assays.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Receptor-mediated assays also allow T Cell Sciences
    to identify compounds that regulate activation but have no effect on resting T cells. In
    contrast, calcineurin is involved in other cell functions besides activation; thus,
    compounds that act at this target may affect resting as well as activated T cells. Such
    compounds can produce unacceptable drug toxicities like those seen with cyclosporin A and
    FK506.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times,Times New Roman">T Cell Sciences&#146; assays can identify both
    compounds that inhibit T cell activation and those that stimulate it. In contrast,
    chemically activated T cell assays can only detect immunoinhibitory molecules.</font></li>
</dir>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">T Cell Sciences&#146; goal is to identify compounds
that act through mechanisms different from calcineurin and that have no effect on resting
T cells. In that way, the company hopes to discover new immunoregulatory drugs that avoid
the toxicity associated with cyclosporin A and FK506. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman"><b>Results to Date</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">T Cell sciences has established a variety of
molecular and cellular assays of TCR-mediated signal transduction which are used to
elucidate the mechanism of action of lead compounds in a rapid and consistent manner. To
date, the company has isolated several lead immunosuppressive compounds from both the
combinatorial and natural product libraries provided by its biotech corporate partners.
For example, one of the compounds that T Cell Sciences has identified inhibits a mouse
model of Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity in a dose dependent manner, with a dosage of 1.0
mg/mouse giving a comparable efficacy to cyclosporin dosed at 2.0 mg/mouse.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">T Cell Sciences has also identified two classes of
immunostimulators from its screening program. One class augments the early stages of T
cell receptor activation, leading to enhanced T cell proliferation as well as IL-2
expression; the other prevents activated T cells from undergoing apoptosis, therefore
leading to a prolonged T cell response. The different mechanisms of action for these two
classes of immunostimulators make them potentially useful for different clinical targets.</font></p>

<P><BR>
Neurobiological Technologies, Inc. <A HREF="http://www.nasdaq.com/scripts/html3/fquote.idc?symname=NTII">(NASDAQ: NTII)</A>, an emerging drug development company, is identifying and developing potential therapeutic products based on advancing neuroscience research. NTII's strategy is to in-license early stage products that have the potential to preserve neurologic function by protecting nerve cells from injury. These compounds target major medical needs and appear to have a clear path through clinical testing and regulatory approval. NTII has assembled a talented and experienced management team to move therapeutics through the final stages of drug development. The company intends to establish alliances with larger pharmaceutical companies to bring its approved products to the marketplace.</P>
<P>NTI<SUP>&reg;</SUP> is currently evaluating two drug candidates in human clinical trials: <A HREF="memweb.htm">Memantine</A>, an orally available NMDA receptor antagonist, for treatment of neuropathic pain and AIDS-related dementia; and <A HREF="crf.htm">Xerecept<SUP>TM</SUP></A>, the company's synthetic preparation of the natural human peptide Corticotropin-Releasing Factor (CRF), for reduction of cerebral edema associated with brain cancer (peritumoral brain edema). The company is also planning a Phase II human clinical trial of Xerecept<SUP>&trade;</SUP> for traumatic brain injury.</P>
<P>The company's scientific focus is <I>neuroprotection</I>, or the prevention of neuronal injury and death associated with a variety of acute, chronic and degenerative neurological conditions. Neuronal injury contributes significantly to functional impairment in many peripheral and central nervous system disorders, including stroke and traumatic brain injury; and chronic diseases such as diabetes, AIDS, and Alzheimer's Disease. NTI<SUP>&reg;</SUP> develops potential <I>neuroprotective</I> drugs to block important pathways of nerve cell damage, including calcium influx caused by glutamate leak (excitotoxicity) and ischemia resulting from cerebral edema (swelling of the brain).</P>
<P>NTI<SUP>&reg;</SUP> is seeking partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which, if successful, may allow NTI<SUP>&reg;</SUP> to secure increased financial resources and additional product development expertise and enable the company to draw upon the sales and marketing capabilities of its partners. NTI<SUP>&reg;</SUP> will also continue to evaluate new technology and other business opportunities that could serve to build the long-term value of the company.</P>
<P>The company was founded in 1987 and went public in February 1994. It is located in Richmond, California and employs 19 persons. As of September 30, 1997, NTI<SUP>&reg;</SUP> had $2.3 million in cash and cash investments, which it believes are adequate to fund its operations through the quarter ending December 31, 1997. The company will need to raise substantial capital to fund subsequent operations. As of September 30, 1997, NTI<SUP>&reg;</SUP> had 6.5 million shares of common stock outstanding.</P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">PRODUCTS IN DEVELOPMENT</H2>
<B><P>Memantine </B>is being evaluated as a potential neuroprotectant drug for the treatment of injured and dying neurons. Memantine is an orally available compound which acts to modulate the <I>N</I>-methyl-<FONT SIZE=2>D</FONT>-aspartate ("NMDA") receptor in the central nervous system. Modulating the NMDA receptor may protect against the neuronal injury and death associated with a number of disorders, including chronic conditions of neuropathic pain, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as acute conditions of traumatic brain injury and stroke. In October 1997, patient enrollment was completed in NTI<SUP>&reg;</SUP>'s Phase II human clinical trial to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of Memantine for neuropathic pain (persistent pain in the absence of any obvious stimulus). This indication is the company's initial priority. Patients with peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes mellitus and patients with post-herpetic neuralgia, a chronic pain condition due to shingles (infection with the herpes Zoster virus) are being enrolled in the trial. The company is also supplying the drug for a Phase II NIH-sponsored study of Memantine for the treatment of AIDS-dementia complex and neuropathic pain. </P>
<B><P>Xerecept<SUP>&trade;</B></SUP> is the company's synthetic preparation of the natural human peptide CRF. In preclinical studies, Xerecept<SUP>&trade;</SUP> has been found to be a potent inhibitor of swelling, or edema. The compound is being developed for its ability to reduce cerebral edema (swelling in the brain), a dangerous condition associated with brain tumors, traumatic brain injury, and stroke. </P>
<P>Evaluating the efficacy of Xerecept<SUP>&trade;</SUP> to control neurological symptoms caused by brain tumor edema (peritumoral brain edema) is the company's initial priority. The company recently submitted an application for orphan drug status of Xerecept<SUP>&trade;</SUP> for peritumoral brain edema and initiated a Phase II clinical trial. This randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial is expected to enroll 90 patients with malignant brain tumors and active neurological symptoms. NTI<SUP>&reg;</SUP>'s objective is to confirm the results of two previously completed pilot Phase I/II trials of Xerecept for this condition in which the compound was well-tolerated and appeared to improve neurological function by an average of 42% when administered to seven patients for seven days. </P>
<P>NTI<SUP>&reg;</SUP> has also submitted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to begin testing Xerecept<SUP>&trade;</SUP> in traumatic brain injury patients. The company expects to initiate Phase II testing of Xerecept<SUP>&trade;</SUP> in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998. Based on preclinical studies demonstrating Xerecept<SUP>&trade;</SUP>'s ability to reduce cerebral edema following traumatic brain injury, the American Brain Injury Consortium ("ABIC") has agreed to collaborate with NTI<SUP>&reg;</SUP> to plan such a Phase II human clinical trial. The consortium includes 160 centers which benefit from standardized study procedures. This collaboration is expected to facilitate trial initiation, enrollment of patients and trial completion.</P>

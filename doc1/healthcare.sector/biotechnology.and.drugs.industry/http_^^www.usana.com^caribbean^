the Caribbean</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<p><IMG SRC="Images/verticalcoupleondock.jpg" ALT="vertical couple on dock" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=98 WIDTH=80 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>The
USANA horizon has officially begun to expand beyond these shores as several
islands of the Caribbean are now open for business. So pull out your planners
and get ready for action.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times"><FONT SIZE=+0><B>The U.S. Virgin Islands,
Bahamas, Barbados, British Virgin Islands, Jamaica, Cayman Islands, and
Bermuda </B>were opened for USANA business on November 3.</FONT></FONT>
<p><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>Now that Distributors
can begin to build their businesses in these islands, there are certain
regulations that must be followed.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>



<FONT face="Times New Roman, Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>Distributors
are advised to investigate all labor and immigration laws of each country.
"This is probably the most important thing a Distributor can do," Glen
Olofson, of the International Development Department, explained. "In some
of these countries you need a special permit even if all you are doing
is promoting your business. It is up to each Distributor to know, study,
and follow the local laws of each country. You might want to check with
the embassy or consulate of each island before arriving there and doing
any business.</FONT></FONT><p></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD COLSPAN="3">

<p><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>All Distributors who are
not U.S. taxpayers are required to fill out a W8 form (available in the
Caribbean Forms Package) along with their Distributor Application. "This
form makes life a lot easier for the Distributor," Glen said. "The W8 form
is an IRS form for people who are not U.S. tax payers but are paid by a
U.S. company. Without it, the IRS requires us to withhold 30 percent of
commissions."</FONT></FONT><p>
<IMG SRC="Images/starfish.jpg" ALT="starfish" HEIGHT=102 WIDTH=157 ALIGN=RIGHT>


<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>To make the sponsoring process
a little easier, certain forms have been created specifically for the Caribbean.
The <a href="../forms/carib13-9565distagree.pdf">Distributor Application</a>,
<a href="../forms/fw8.pdf">W-8 Form</a>,
<a href="../forms/carib70-126orderform.pdf">Product Order</a>,
<a href="../forms/carib19-9526distautoship.pdf">Autoship</a>, and
<a href="../forms/carib33-9573prodexg_return.pdf">Product Exchange/Return</a> forms are now available in English, French, and Spanish
in a trilingual format.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>To place orders, new Distributors
in the Caribbean (excluding Puerto Rico) may use credit cards and money
orders only, all in U.S. funds. Bank drafts and checks are not being accepted
at this time.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>In addition to normal shipping
charges, there will be an additional charge of $22. "We have carefully
evaluated various forms of transportation, looking for a system that would
be reliable, and at the same time, as economical as possible," Glen said.
"Federal Express was the least expensive and most reliable way we could
find to ship at this time. However, we will continue to re-evaluate the
situation and find the least expensive way we can."&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>"We need to remember to
allow adequate time for orders to arrive on the islands," added Philip
Wong, Project Manager of International Development at USANA. "Distributors
should expect shipping to take a couple of extra days. Also, whoever receives
the package is responsible for paying taxes and duty on that package. Federal
Express will call beforehand and let them know the cost."&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times"><FONT SIZE=+0>"We are very excited about
this expansion," Glen continued. "This is a great opportunity for Distributors
to expand their businesses. People in these countries will experience the
improved health that can come with the use of the USANA products and the
financial benefits of becoming a USANA Distributor. We are excited about
welcoming the people of the Caribbean to the USANA family."&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></TD>

<p>Only rarely does a company create an entirely new diagnostic

technology platform. T Cell Sciences' TRAx ® assay invention is

an example of one of these rare breakthroughs. Launched in the

U.S. market in 1995, the TRAx® CD4 product introduces the

simplicity and cost effectiveness of ELISA-based testing as an

alternative to flow cytometry.</p>



<p>The technology used in TRAx products is elegant in its

simplicity. A non-ionic detergent is used to breakup cells; the

presence and amount of a target marker or cell type is then

determined by a standard immunoassay. TRAx CD4 measures the

number of CD4 cells in blood; these levels primarily are used in

monitoring the health of HIV-infected individuals. TRAx CD4 is

just the first product utilizing this technology. CD8 will be the

next test introduced.</p>



<p>T Cell Sciences will realize the value of the TRAx-based

technology through distribution and licensing agreements with

other companies. First priority has been to bring the TRAx

immunoassay kit to market. T Cell is reaching this goal through a

sales and distribution agreement signed with Diamedix Corporation

in December 1995 covering the United States. The Diamedix

agreement, combined with a five-year manufacturing agreement

reached with Endogen, Inc. in March 1996, improves T Cell's

marketing position while reducing selling, distribution and

manufacturing costs. T Cell already has a distribution agreement

with Yamanouchi for TRAx kits in Japan. T Cell plans to enter

into additional kit distribution contracts, as well as licensing

arrangements, that will bring the proprietary technology to

selected automated equipment manufacturers.</p>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Neogen is proud to introduce its new line of rapid detection tests
for Histamine, <A HREF="salmon.html">Salmonella</A> and <A HREF="chloram.html">Chloramphenicol</A>
in the seafood industry. These kits are designed to become effective
tools for HACCP Compliance and for Seafood Safety.<HR>

<IMG SRC="histami1.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM">ALERT for Histamine&#153
<P>
Alert is a quick screening test which detects histamine in canned
and fresh fish. Scombroid poisoning occurs in people and some
animals sensitive to histamine. The microbial breakdown of histidine
to histamine occurs when certain freshly caught fish are not kept
cold. Histamine production is common in fish such as tuna, mahi-mahi,
bluefish, mackerel, anchovies, sardines and menhaden, the major
ingredient of fishmeal which is used frequently in animal feeds.
<P>
Neogen's Alert test is sensitive enough to detect histamine at
graded levels from 5 to 15 parts per million for use by canners
to 50 parts per million, the FDA Defect Action Level. The Alert
test was developed to comply with federal regulations, improve
and speed up quality control programs and aid in the implementation
of HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points) programs.

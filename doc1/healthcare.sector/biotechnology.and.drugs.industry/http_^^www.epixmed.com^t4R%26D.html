EPIX is developing new agents designedspecifically for imaging blood clots in seeking to develop a targetedcontrast agent and protocol that would enable MRI to illuminate bloodclots against a dark background. EPIX believes that its proprietarytechnology platform could also enable MRI to differentiate old andnew clot formations and that such a product would change thediagnostic pathway for many of the conditions associated withthrombotic disease, including pulmonary embolism and deep veinthrombosis. EPIX believes that a thrombosis-specific contrast agentcould largely replace the noninvasive modalities currently in use,including nuclear medicine ventilation/perfusion scans.<P><IMG SRC="images/Carotid_dulled.gif" WIDTH=268 HEIGHT=231ALIGN=middle><P>Functional Brain Imaging. Functional brain imaging involvesmeasuring small changes in the brain to, in effect, "watch" the brainfunction in real time. In the past, these cognitive function mappingstudies were done using modalities such as electro-encephalograms andnuclear medicine, both of which are generally recognized to have lowresolution and provide limited clinical information. Recentlyhowever, investigators at a number of institutions, including MGH,have developed a new brain imaging technique using MRI. At present,studies are being conducted using a specialized MRI technique whichdoes not employ a contrast agent. However, these studies arecurrently difficult to interpret since blood flow changes induced bycognitive activity are subtle and associated signals are weak.Clinical applications of functional brain imaging are potentiallybroad, including pre-surgical planning, neurodegenerative diseasediagnosis and psychiatry.<P>EPIX is currently conducting preclinical testing of prototypebrain imaging agents with researchers at MGH based on the Company'sproprietary technology platform. The Company is seeking to establishthe feasibility of developing an agent that would be able to magnifythe signal from small volume changes in blood flow to particularareas of the brain.<P><A HREF="#top">Return to top of page</A><P><CENTER><HR>&copy; 1997, EPIX Medical, Inc.<BR><P><CENTER>E-mail us at<A HREF="mailto:info@epixmed.com">info@epixmed.com</A></CENTER><P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></BODY></HTML>

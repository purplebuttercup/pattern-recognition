<U>FEED, GRAIN AND NUT MARKETS 
<br></U>
<p>The feed, grain and nut markets serve as the foundation for the food
chain. Accordingly, it is important to determine the quality of food used
on a daily basis. Feed and grain supplies are often contaminated by mycotoxins
which are residues caused by mold growths. 
<br></p>

<p>Virtually all food and feed producers monitor for mycotoxins because
of the detrimental effect they have on the health and performance of animals.
Aflatoxin is of particular concern because it is the most potent of all
naturally-occurring carcinogens, and is regulated by USDA. Other mycotoxins
include: fumonisin, vomitoxin (DON), T-2 toxin, zearalenone and ochratoxin.
Neogen offers the Agri-Screen &quot;screening&quot; test and the Veratox
&quot;quantitative&quot; test systems.
<br></p>

<p>The feed, grain and nut industries also need to test their products for
the foodborne bacteria, salmonella. Producers use scientific-based tests
to help them exclude unwholesome grain from the food chain. Neogen markets
its salmonella test under the trade name Reveal. 
<br></p>

<p>In addition to mycotoxins or foodborne bacteria, feed and grain processors
test for pesticides in their food products. Neogen's Agri-Screen Ticket
delivers quick results in the field detection for air, water, soil, produce,
crops, spills, surfaces, solvents, custom samples and agronomic crops.

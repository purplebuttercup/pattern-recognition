<P>					Neoprobe's RIGS technology is a powerful new tool for cancer surgeons.  Surgery remains thefirst-line treatmentfor most kinds of cancer.  Right now, the most effective tools of cancer surgeons are their eyes and hands.  RIGS technology adds an exciting new dimension in surgical cancer care.  It helps surgeons as they operate to pinpoint otherwise hidden cancer that is too small to see or feel.  Neoprobe's clinical trials with colorectal cancer patients are showing that the RIGS system finds hidden tumors in a significant number of patients.<BR>
<BR>
	Creating this indispensable weapon for surgeons to use in the war on cancer has taken the dedication, hard work, hopes, and dreams of cancer researchers and patients worldwide, along with everyone at Neoprobe.  Here, a surgeon, a patient and her cancer care team, and Neoprobe's visionary co-founder reflect on questions that profoundly impact their own futures and those of generations to come.</P>

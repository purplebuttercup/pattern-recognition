- Brain Cancer </b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="MS Sans Serif">Avigen's brain cancer
program uses AAV vector containing the gene for the enzyme
tymidine-kinase (TK) along with the injection of the antiviral
drug ganciclovir. This vector may be injected stereotactically or
applied at the time of surgery and expresses the TK gene.
Expression of the TK gene in dividing cells converts ganciclovir
into a toxic byproduct that causes the destruction of the cancer
cells. Because cell destruction is limited to dividing cells and
since normal brain cells are non-dividing, the approach is
particularly suitable for the brain. Animal studies conducted by
Avigen in which mice were implanted with human glioma cells have
shown that a single injection of AAV-Tk vector along with
ganciclovir provides a significant reduction in tumor size.
Moreover, there was an evidence of bystander effect: not only did
the cells that received TK expression die but also the tumor
cells that were in contact with these cells but that did not
receive TK expression. Avigen is currently conducting additional
toxicity and efficacy testing and anticipates the therapy to
enter clinical trials in the second half of 1997. </font></p>

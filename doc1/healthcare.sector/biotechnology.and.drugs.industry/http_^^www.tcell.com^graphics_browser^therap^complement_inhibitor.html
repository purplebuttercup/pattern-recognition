<hr>

<p>T Cell Sciences is developing a new class of therapeutics based on inhibition of the
complement system, a key triggering mechanism for the human inflammatory response. Medical
problems that result from excessive complement activation affect millions of people
throughout the world and represent multi-billion dollar market opportunities. They
include:

<ul>
  <li>reperfusion injury - the vascular and tissue damage that occurs following a heart attack
    or stroke</li>
  <li>tissue injury following a surgical procedure where the patient&#146;s blood supply is
    shut off and then restored</li>
  <li>hyperacute or chronic organ rejection following transplantation </li>
  <li>acute inflammatory injury to the lungs including adult respiratory distress syndrome
    (ARDS)</li>
  <li>autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or lupus </li>
  <li>Alzheimer&#146;s disease </li>
</ul>

<p>The Company&#146;s first product candidate, TP10, is now being evaluated in two
separate efficacy trials - a Phase IIa trial for ARDS and a Phase I/II trial of
reperfusion injury following lung transplants. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i><u>What is the Complement System?</u></i></b></p>

<p>The complement system consists of a series of blood proteins that when activated,
undergo a cascading series of enzymatic interactions that ultimately trigger the human
inflammatory response. This complement cascade is similar in mechanisms and importance to
the blood enzyme cascades that make up the coagulation, fibrinolytic, and
renin/angiotensin/kinin systems. Understanding the latter three major cascades has
produced a number of important and life saving therapeutic products which inhibit or
enhance each of these enzyme systems. For example, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is
an enzyme from the fibrinolytic cascade used to dissolve blood clots. Anti-coagulants,
such as heparin, inhibit the coagulation cascade. ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme)
inhibitors reduce hypertension (high blood pressure) caused by the renin/angiotensin/kinin
system. To date, no therapeutic products are available to regulate the complement system.
TP10, now undergoing human clinical testing, is the lead compound in this new class of
therapeutics.</p>

<p>The complement system&#146;s role is to defend the body rapidly and aggressively from
infection or injury. It can be activated through infection by microorganisms such as
bacteria, by direct cell injury, or during an immune response. When activated, the first
protein in the system splits, creating an enzyme that then activates the next protein and
so on, in a sequential fashion. The resulting enzyme cascade drives the inflammatory
response that is necessary to protect the body. However, this response may also be
destructive if inappropriately or chronically activated.</p>

<p>Activation of the complement cascade causes many down-stream inflammatory events: e.g.,
increased permeability of blood vessels; the activation and attraction of neutrophils; and
the formation of the complement membrane attack complex which injures and kills tissue
directly. In ARDS, complement activation causes increased blood vessel permeability of the
lungs that results in fluid and blood cell leakage into that organ. During a heart attack,
complement activation during the time of reperfusion kills the already injured tissue,
significantly increasing the amount of damage to the heart.</p>

<p>The economic opportunity available to a successful complement inhibitor is enormous.
The company estimates the market potential for complement inhibitors in the range of $2 to
4 billion, an amount similar to the markets realized by drugs for other cascade systems.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i><u>Soluble Complement Receptor One</u></i></b></p>

<p>TP10 is the soluble form of a naturally occurring complement regulatory protein,
complement receptor-1, or sCR1. This compound works at several points in the complement
cascade to minimize all forms of complement-mediated inflammation. T Cell Sciences and its
collaborators have evaluated TP10 in numerous preclinical animal models, resulting in over
60 peer reviewed publications since 1990. Today, approximately 50 academic research
collaborations relating to TP10 are in progress. </p>

<p>In studies reported in <i>Science</i>, TP10 reduced the area of heart tissue damaged by
44 percent in a rat model of heart attack. Additional encouraging data have since been
published supporting the protective effects of TP10 in limiting reperfusion injury in
other models. Studies published in the <i>Journal of Immunology</i> show that TP10
significantly reduced complement-mediated lung permeability in four different animal
models. In these models, TP10 also produced significant decreases in blood vessel leakage.
Since complement plays a major role in recognizing and eliminating foreign (non-self)
substances in the body, blocking unwanted complement activation may prove important in
organ transplantation by preventing hyperacute (extremely rapid) rejection of allografts
(same species transplants) and xenografts (cross species transplants). In animal models of
hyperacute and acute (near term) rejection, published in <i>Transplantation</i> and <i>Transplantation
Proceedings</i>, TP10 was shown to prolong significantly the survival of the transplanted
organs in both allograft and xenograft models. Since the demand for organ transplants is
greater than the supply of human donor organs, xenotransplantation may become a realistic
alternative to allograft transplantation if hyperacute rejection can be prevented.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i><u>Clinical Development</u></i></b></p>

<p>Under the company&#146;s direction, researchers completed the first phase I clinical
trial of TP10 in patients at risk for ARDS in 1995. ARDS affects over 250,000 patients per
year in the United States. Results of this trial were presented in October 1995 at the
American College of Chest Physicians meeting. A second phase I safety trial for
reperfusion injury was completed in December 1995 in patients with first-time myocardial
infarction, which affects approximately 1.5 million Americans per year. This study was
presented at the American Heart Association&#146;s Joint Conference on Thrombosis,
Arteriosclerosis and Vascular Biology in February 1996. In each of these trials, TP10
demonstrated excellent safety and pharmacokinetic profiles with no drug-related adverse
events. In addition, the drug exhibited a clearance time of at least 70 hours and was able
to inhibit complement activity in a dose-dependent manner.</p>

<p>With safety confirmed in two indications, efficacy testing of TP10 began in 1996 - the
first complement inhibitor of any kind to advance to this level of testing in humans. In
January 1996, a Phase IIa clinical trial of TP10 began in patients ARDS. In August 1996,
enrollment began in a Phase I/II trial of TP10 in patients with reperfusion injury
following lung transplantation. Patient accrual for this trial was completed in May 1997.</p>

<p>In October, T&nbsp;Cell announced positive results from the efficacy portion of our
Phase I/II clinical study of TP10 in patients undergoing lung transplantation. The 60
patient trial was aimed at evaluating the ability of TP10 to reduce reperfusion injury
(the vascular damage that often occurs following surgery or a heart attack, where a
patient&#146;s blood supply is shut off and then reintroduced) and improve lung function
in patients with end-stage pulmonary disease who were undergoing lung transplant surgery.
The results showed that 24 hours after surgery significantly fewer of the patients
receiving TP10 required ventilation as compared to those receiving placebo. Moreover,
those patients who received TP10 and also underwent cardiopulmonary bypass as part of the
transplantation procedure showed significantly decreased intubation time and time on
ventilation. Reduction in the time that a patient requires intubation and mechanical
ventilation typically translates to better clinical outcome and also implies an economic
benefit from reduced time in the ICU.</p>

<p>These findings in the area of reperfusion in a transplantation setting additionally
support positive observations made previously in a Phase I study of TP10&#146;s ability to
prevent reperfusion injury in patients undergoing heart attacks. As a result, we plan to
conduct further studies of this drug candidate in a cardiac reperfusion setting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i><u>Complement Inhibitor Pipeline </u></i></b></p>

<p>In addition to TP10, T Cell has identified other product candidates to inhibit
activation of the complement system. The lead candidate in preclinical development is an
altered form of sCR1 (TP10) which the company has modified to add sLe<sup>x </sup>carbohydrate
structures. sLe<sup>x </sup>is a sugar structure that mediates binding of certain white
blood cells (neutrophils) to selectin proteins appearing on the surface of activated
endothelial cells and platelets at the onset of inflammation. Selectin-mediated binding of
circulating neutrophils to activated endothelial cells is a critical event in
inflammation. Compared to TP10, the combined sCR1-sLe<sup>x</sup> molecule has
demonstrated increased functional benefits in<i> in vitro</i> and early <i>in vivo</i>
experiments, and may be particularly useful in the treatment of heart attacks and stroke.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i><u>Patents and Proprietary Rights</u></i></b></p>

<p>Patent protection covering CR1-based compounds is extensive. Among others, the company
holds patents or licenses to patents on CR1 (including sCR1) covering its composition, its
use in treating disease, its use in combination with other drugs and means for its
purification and production. The company also has filed a patent covering compounds
comprising sCR1 and an adhesion-inhibiting molecule. Such compounds may, in certain
clinical settings, possess an additional capacity of binding to the walls of blood vessels
damaged by the effects of inflammation. This action both localizes anti-complement
activity to where it is needed and helps protect the damaged site from further injury by
inflammatory cells.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i><u>Commercial Relationships</u></i></b></p>

<p>TP10 was developed jointly by T Cell Sciences and SmithKline Beecham from 1989 to 1994.
In February 1995, T Cell Sciences regained all rights to the drug still held by SmithKline
Beecham and now has worldwide rights, outside of Japan, to develop, manufacture and market
TP10. In Japan, SmithKline Beecham and Yamanouchi continue to retain co-marketing rights
for the compound.</p>

<p>In October 1997, T Cell announced the first of what we hope to be a series of
collaborative agreements for our complement program. This agreement with Novartis Pharma
AG, the worldwide leader in the transplantation field, is for the development of TP10 for
use in xenotransplantation (animal organs into humans) and allotransplantation (human to
human). T Cell will receive annual option fees and supplies of TP10 for clinical trials in
return for granting Novartis a two-year option to license exclusive worldwide rights
(except Japan) to TP10 for the specified indications. Should Novartis exercise its option
to license TP10, it will make an equity investment in T Cell, and provide licensing fees
and milestone payments based on the attainment of certain goals. The combined option and
license is valued at up to $25 million. T Cell may also receive research funding in
addition to royalty payments on eventual product sales.</p>

<p>In 1996, T Cell granted the drug delivery company Cytotherapeutics, Inc. a
non-exclusive license covering certain patent rights to CR1 for use in their
encapsulated-cell products for the delivery of drugs to the central nervous system. T Cell
Sciences received a payment upon the signing of the agreement, and will receive future
milestone and royalty payments.</p>

<p>TP10 has the potential to be the flagship product in a new class of therapeutics called
complement inhibitors. With the development of complement inhibitors, it may at last be
possible to address a major cause of inflammatory tissue damage in critical medical
conditions with previously unmet therapeutic needs. </p>

<p><font size="2" face="MS Sans Serif">Cancer affects
approximately one-third of the U.S. population and is the second
leading cause of death: 1.2 million cases are diagnosed each year
and over 500,000 people die from it annually. Cancer is also the
leading cause of disease-related death in children and young
adults. Current approved therapies for the treatment of cancer
include chemotherapy, surgery and radiation or a combination of
these with the aim of destroying the tumor, while leaving as much
as possible of the normal tissue intact. These treatments,
however, often have serious side effects with limited efficacy.
More recently, drugs for specific tumor types, such as
Interleukin-2 for renal cancer and Taxol for ovarian and breast
cancer, were commercialized. Other exciting developments in the
field relate to an increased understanding of developments in the
field relate to an increased understanding of tumor suppressor
genes, oncogenes, specific cancer-related genetic mutations,
apoptosis (programmed cell death) and tumor antigens. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="MS Sans Serif">Gene therapy offers unique
potential for cancer treatment. Today, a number of gene therapy
trials are ongoing in various cancer patients, such as Vical's
immunotherapy approaches using Allovectin-7 for melanoma, renal,
colon, breast and lymphoma cancer and Leuvectin for various tumor
types; Somatix's GVAX tumor vaccine for melanoma and kidney
cancer; and Progenic's GMK vaccine for melanoma in Phase III. </font></p>

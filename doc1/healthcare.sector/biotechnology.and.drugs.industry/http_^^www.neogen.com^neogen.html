<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Founded in 1982, Neogen is a publicly-held company (NASDAQ:NEOG)
headquartered in Lansing, Mich. with locations in Lexington, Ky.,
Schiller Park, Ill. and Bridgeport, N.J. The company has about
150 employees with an internal sales force and a distribution
network that now markets over 160 different diagnostic products
servicing food, animal health, pharmacologic and agricultural
markets.<BR>

<P>
People all over the world depend on safe food.<BR>

<P>
There is a growing concern, however, over the emergence of harmful
pathogens in our food and feed supplies. Numerous foodborne disease
outbreaks in recent years are having a major impact on human life.
In the U.S. alone, an estimated 33 million people develop foodborne
illnesses annually, costing $23 billion in health care and lost
productivity.<BR>

<P>
Neogen Corporation's mission is to be the dominant company in
the marketing of products to control residues or improve quality
for the food and agriculture industries. Our company's goal is
&quot;Safer Food Through Innovation.&quot; Today, consumers are
demanding that producers use more effective tools to better manage
the use of agricultural chemicals and to detect harmful pathogens
before the quality of food is compromised. Working with producers
and governmental agencies, Neogen offers a variety of unique,
rapid-test products to help solve this escalating problem.<BR>

<P>
To meet growing market demand, Neogen relies heavily on its research
and development capabilities for the creation of new products
and enhancement of existing product lines.<BR>

<P>
Neogen supplements its internal research efforts through research
and development agreements with over 20 major universities and
several federal agencies. This company believes its cooperative
research strategy has enabled it to produce better products faster,
and more cost effectively than if research were conducted solely
by Neogen employees in company facilities.<BR>

<P>
The world is demanding safer food. With innovative products helping
food processors meet these demands, Neogen is well-positioned
to achieve its mission of being the dominant company in the marketing
of products to control residues and improve quality in food, agriculture
and other markets.<BR>

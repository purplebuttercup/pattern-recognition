<p><font size="2" face="MS Sans Serif">Anemia is a blood disorder
that results in a deficiency of red blood cells and hemoglobin.
This therapy is in preclinical development. There are two broad
categories of anemic diseases: inherited and acquired. In
inherited diseases, such as sickle cell anemia and
beta-thalassemia, the anemia is caused by abnormal or inadequate
hemoglobin molecules. Acquired anemia can be caused by renal
failure, AIDS or chemotherapy for cancer. In these cases, the
body does not produce an adequate amount of hemoglobin. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="MS Sans Serif">The current standard of
care treatment for patients with acquired anemia is
erythropoietin (EPO) injections. EPO is a glycoprotein hormone
that stimulates the production of red blood cells in the bone
marrow. Currently, Amgen manufactures a recombinant form of
erythropoeitin, for which it has the rights to market in the
United States for renal dialysis patients, while Johnson &amp;
Johnson has the rights to market EPO for all other indications.
There are an estimated 215,000 renal failure patients in the
United States that receive dialysis, with approximately 88% of
them using Epogen. About 50,000 AIDS patients also use EPO. Total
sales of erythropoietin (through both Amgen and Johnson &amp;
Johnson) were over $2 billion dollars in 1995. Johnson &amp;
Johnson is also in early development stage for small peptides
that mimic EPO's receptor binding and may eventually lead to an
orally active small molecule EPO substitute drug. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="MS Sans Serif"><b>AAV-EPO - Anemia</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="MS Sans Serif">Avigen has a preclinical
program for the treatment of anemia using the AAV vector
containing the erythropoietin (EPO) gene. Avigen has shown in
animal studies that a single injection of its AAV-EPO vector can
provide high levels of EPO in the blood for at least eight
months. Moreover, the produces EPO is biologically active,
resulting in a continuously elevated hematocrit level in a
dose-dependent manner. The company is conducting further efficacy
studies in animal models for renal failure and beta thalassemia. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="MS Sans Serif">We believe that Avigen's
method of increasing EPO levels and red blood cell production has
a potential advantage over current treatment. AAV gene therapy
offers the possibility of increasing hematocrit to a normal level
for an extended time period from a single injection, as compared
with the current EPO therapy, which requires two or three
injections per week. This may be particularly significant for
diseases such as sickle cell anemia and beta thalassemia, where a
high concentration of EPO is believed to be required in order to
have a therapeutic impact. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="MS Sans Serif">An
interesting aspect of AAV is that it integrates into a specific
location on chromosome 19. This property is attributed to one of
the components of the AAV, the Rep protein. In an AAV vector, all
viral genes including the gene for Rep are removed, thereby
reducing or eliminating the ability of the vector to integrate
into the cell genome. However, for applications where integration
is necessary in order to pass the gene to off-spring cells,
Avigen has developed the TVI system. This system consists of the
Rep protein and the gene cassette and can be delivered in a
variety of vector systems, retaining the site specific
integration into chromosome 19. This is important to its safety
profile because random DNA integration has the risk of activating
undesired genes such as oncogenes or inactivating desired genes
on the cell genome. </font></p>

</center></div>

<p><font size="2" face="MS Sans Serif">Another advantage of TVI
is that if used with appropriate delivery system such as
non-viral vectors, it allows for the delivery of large gene
sequences. Delivering large segments of DNA is important for gene
therapy applications that require several genes or regulatory
elements. This is becoming increasingly important as the field of
gene therapy begins to address the problems of gene regulation
and tissue specific expression, as well as the treatment of
common diseases which require multiple genes. </font></p>

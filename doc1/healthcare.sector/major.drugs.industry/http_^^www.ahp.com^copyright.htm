The Site may, from time to time, contain information relating to various

The Site contains information which is forward-looking and involves risks

and uncertainties, including, without limitation, risks associated with the

inherent uncertainty of pharmaceutical research, product development

on Form 10-Q and the annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities

and Exchange Commission.  Actual results may differ from the

forward-looking information.<p>



Through your access to and use of the Site, you accept, without

limitation or qualification, the terms and conditions ("Terms and

Conditions") set forth below. <p>



<b>TERMS AND CONDITIONS </b><p>



1. You may freely browse the Site. You may freely download material

allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so some of the above

exclusions may not apply to you. Check your local laws for any

restrictions or limitations regarding the exclusion of implied

warranties. <p>



5. Any communication or material that you transmit to, or post on, the

Site by electronic mail or otherwise, including any data, questions,

10. AHP reserves the right to alter or delete material from the Site at

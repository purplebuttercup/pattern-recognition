<P>
<font color="#FF0000">Q:</font> My friend has animated images when he views
certain sites, but if I view the same site, I do not see the animated
images. Why don't I see them?
<br>
<font color="#330099">A:</font> First, you need a browser that supports
animated gifs, such as <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape 2.0</A>
or later, and <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Explorer 3.0</A>.  
Second, if you are using Netscape, make sure under OPTIONS | NETWORK
PREFERENCES you have your memory cache set to at least 500 so that your
computer has the memory designated to show animated gifs. Animated images
can be found right on the 
<A HREF="index.shtml">home page</A> of this site, in which the various
Warner-Lambert products display in rotation.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000">Q:</font> Do all browsers support Javascript?
<br>
<font color="#330099">A:</font> Currently, only Netscape 2.0 or greater
and Microsoft Explorer 3.0 or greater support the Javascript language.
However, Microsoft's Explorer version of Javascript is still buggy.
Also, Netscape 3.0 test versions have some Javascript bugs in them sometimes.
An example of Javascript on the Warner-Lambert site would be the 
<A HREF="http://warner-lambert/info/bodymass.html">interactive Body 
Mass Index</A> calculations.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000">Q:</font> Do all browsers support Java?
<br>
<font color="#330099">A:</font> Both Netscape 2.0 or greater and Microsoft's
Explorer 3.0 provide Java support. An example of Java on the
Warner-Lambert site would be the Warner-Lambert <A HREF="http://www.warner-lambert.com/info/financialcenter.shtml">Stock Ticker</A>.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000">Q:</font> What is RealAudio? How can I get a RealAudio
player?
<br>
<font color="#330099">A:</font> RealAudio is an online audio format that
compresses audio files for faster transmission. What is nice about RealAudio
is that a user does not have to download the entire audio file and then play
it. Instead, the audio file begins playing almost the minute the user clicks
on the audio link. RealAudio players are available from 
<A HREF="http://www.realaudio.com/">Progressive Networks</A>, along with
technical support. An example of RealAudio on the Warner-Lambert site would
be the <A HREF="http://www.warner-lambert.com/info/chairmanswelcome.html">President's Welcome</A> message.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000">Q:</font> What about these plug-ins I keep hearing about? What are they, and what browsers support them?
<br>
<font color="#330099">A:</font> Both Netscape and Microsoft Explorer support
plug-ins, which are various programs (usually multimedia-based) that perform
right inside a web page (as opposed to loading into a completely new window).
RealAudio supports a plug-in (as seen on our
<A HREF="http://www.warner-lambert.com/info/chairmanswelcome.html">President's Welcome</A> 
message) in which the audio console controls appear right on the web page!
Other popular plug-ins include Macromedia's 
<A HREF="http://www.macromedia.com/">Shockwave</A>, for playing multimedia
presentations, and Adobe's <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/">Acrobat Reader</A>,
which allows users to view PDF documents.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000">Q:</font> Where can I go to send comments and ask questions to Warner-Lambert?
<br>
<font color="#330099">A:</font> Please visit our 
<A HREF="feedback.html">feedback</A> area where we welcome your comments.

Premarin&reg; (conjugated estrogens tablets, USP), which is the most prescribed medication in the United States, will retain its place as the leading medication for the prevention and management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.  Nearly ten million American women currently take Premarin.<p>"Based on data comparing raloxifene and Premarin, I expect that Premarin will remain the first-line treatment for the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women," said William C. Andrews, M.D., Professor Emeritus, Eastern Virginia Medical School.  "There is nothing in the clinical data to suggest that raloxifene can substitute for the multiple benefits of Premarin. However, raloxifene may be an option for the small number of women for whom estrogen is contraindicated."<p><B>Limited Raloxifene Data</B><p>Data presented at the FDA's Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee on November 20, 1997 comparing Premarin to raloxifene and placebo, indicated that bone mineral density improvements were significantly better for Premarin than raloxifene.  Over the 24 months of the study, bone mineral density at the hip increased three times more in patients on Premarin than those receiving raloxifene.  While Premarin continued to show a positive effect on bone mineral density throughout the entire 24 months, raloxifene showed bone mineral density declining after 18 months of use.<p>The Committee generally characterized raloxifene's bone data as only modestly effective.  They also expressed desire to see fracture data -- which were not available -- and raised questions about the long-term effects of therapy with respect to heart disease, cognitive function, and breast cancer. Only limited data with no comparison to estrogen were presented at the advisory committee meeting concerning raloxifene's effect on breast tissue. Several experts noted that safety data were far too limited and preliminary to attribute any potential breast-protective effect to raloxifene.<p>In addition, hot flashes occurred five to nine times more frequently with raloxifene compared to Premarin&reg; (conjugated estrogens tablets, USP).  The primary reason women seek medical treatment at the time of menopause is for relief of vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness all of which can affect a woman's sense of well-being and sexual intimacy.  Furthermore, raloxifene failed to increase HDL or "good cholesterol" levels.<p>"The FDA Advisory Committee reiterated that Premarin provides women with a range of health benefits for today and tomorrow," said Marc W. Deitch, M.D., Senior Vice President, Medical Affairs, Global Medical Director, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories.  "Premarin has a 55-year history of use by millions of women, and researchers continue to discover more benefits about Premarin every day." Premarin is indicated for vasomotor symptoms and the prevention and management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.  It is the most prescribed medication in the United States.<p>Premarin is being studied in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) national trial involving more than 27,500 women.  WHI is designed to examine the impact of estrogen replacement therapy or hormone replacement therapy on heart disease, cancer and osteoporosis over a period of 14 years.  Wyeth-Ayerst also sponsors the Heart and Estrogen-progestin Replacement Study (HERS), as well as the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHI-MS), which is investigating the use of ERT/HRT in Alzheimer's disease.<p><B>Contraindications</B><p>Some women should not take estrogen replacement therapy (ERT).  A woman should make sure her doctor or health care provider is aware of her complete personal family history before taking ERT.  The history should include instances of breast cancer, breast lumps, abnormal vaginal bleeding, abnormal blood clotting, severe headache, dizziness, and liver disease.  Women who are pregnant should not take ERT.  Estrogens have been reported to increase the risk of cancer of the uterus in postmenopausal women.  If women have had a hysterectomy they don't have this risk.  Adding the hormone progestin to estrogen greatly reduces the risk.<p>Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, a division of American Home Products Corporation (NYSE: AHP), is a major research-oriented pharmaceutical company with leading products in the areas of women's health care, cardiovascular and metabolic disease therapies, central nervous system drugs, anti-inflammatory agents, vaccines, and generic pharmaceuticals.

		<B>TORRANCE, CA, May 7, 1996 -- Total Renal Care Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:
		TRL)</B> today announced record net revenues and net income for the first
		quarter ended March 31, 1996, primarily as a continuation of the
		Company's aggressive, disciplined acquisition strategy combined
		with strong same store growth.<P>
		For the quarter ended March 31, 1996, TRL's net revenues increased
		97% to $50,237,000 from $25,469,000 reported for the restated,
		comparable period last year. Results for the first three months
		of 1995 are restated due to the change in the Company's fiscal
		year end from May 31 to December 31. Net income grew 327% to $4,276,000,
		or $0.19 per share, based on 23,035,000 weighted average shares
		outstanding, compared with $1,001,000, or $0.07 per share, based
		on 15,353,000 weighted average shares outstanding for the same
		period last year. The increase in weighted average shares outstanding
		primarily resulted from the Company's initial public offering
		on October 30, 1995.<P>
		&quot;Our strong financial results for this quarter reflect the successful
		implementation of our aggressive, yet disciplined growth strategy,&quot;
		stated Victor M.G. Chaltiel, TRL Chairman, President and Chief
		Executive Officer. &quot;We have achieved significant accomplishments
		toward this goal since the beginning of the year, including acquiring
		Caremark's dialysis facilities, which represent our largest acquisition
		to date. Another notable achievement was the substantial improvement
		of our financial position through the recent completion of an
		equity offering and expansion of our credit facility, which will
		support our continued growth.&quot;<P>
		<B>TRL's Managed Care Focus</B><P>
		&quot;Since its inception, Total Renal Care has focused on partnering
		with managed care organizations to provide the highest quality
		treatment for End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients while controlling
		total costs,&quot; explained Chaltiel. &quot;We anticipated the recent announcement
		by the Health Care Financing Administration, which invited managed
		care organizations to bid for a three-year, limited (about 1%
		of the total ESRD population) &quot;demonstration project&quot; to capitate
		all costs related to ESRD patients, and we have positioned our
		Company to partner with these organizations to offer extensive
		ESRD patient services. In addition to dialysis treatments, we
		provide ESRD-related pharmacy and laboratory services, and offer
		vascular access management and pre- and post-transplant service
		programs. We also have developed and continue to strengthen our
		physician networks, which enhances our managed care strategy.<P>
		&quot;Last month, we opened the San Diego-based Mission Dialysis Center,
		which is serving Kaiser Permanente's 75 local ESRD patients, as
		well as other dialysis patients residing in that community,&quot; continued
		Chaltiel. &quot;This contract represents the first of its kind developed
		by Kaiser Permanente, which is by far the largest private ESRD
		payor in the Southern California area. We believe this is a strong
		indication of our ability to team with managed care organizations,
		and we are actively pursuing additional relationships such as
		this one.&quot;<P>
		<B>Expansion During the Quarter</B><P>
		&quot;Through the Caremark and other acquisitions, combined with <I>de novo</I> developments, we added 39 additional dialysis centers treating
		approximately 2,000 patients during the first quarter,&quot; stated
		Chaltiel. &quot;By increasing the number of facilities we operate,
		we achieve economies of scale related to operating multiple centers
		in specific geographic areas.&quot;<P>
		On March 15, 1996, the Company completed the $49.0 million acquisition
		of 32 outpatient dialysis facilities from Caremark International.
		These centers are primarily located in the Minneapolis/St. Paul
		area, where the Company is now established as the leading provider
		of dialysis services, as well as in Northern California, further
		strengthening its presence in that market. The Caremark acquisition
		also establishes TRL as the third largest dialysis provider in
		the U.S.<P>
		<B>Financial Strength to Pursue Additional Expansion</B><P>
		TRL has the financial strength to continue its aggressive, yet
		disciplined acquisition strategy as a result of its recent public
		offering and expanded bank credit line. On April 3, 1996, TRL
		completed an equity offering of common stock at $33.125 per share,
		raising $116 million. On March 15, 1996, the Company increased
		its credit facility, currently unused, to $100 million. TRL also
		completed an initial public offering of 6.9 million shares of
		common stock at $15.50 per share on October 30, 1995.<P>
		Torrance, California-based Total Renal Care Holdings, Inc. is
		the third largest provider of integrated dialysis services in
		the U.S. for patients suffering from chronic kidney failure. The
		Company owns and operates high-quality, free-standing kidney dialysis
		centers and home peritoneal dialysis programs in 15 states and
		Guam and also provides high-quality acute hemodialysis services
		to inpatients on behalf of 72 hospitals. TRL has increased its
		number of outpatient dialysis facilities to 108 with 1,554 stations,
		and provides services to approximately 7,700 patients. The Company
		additionally operates ESRD laboratory and pharmacy facilities,
		as well as vascular access management and transplant services
		programs.<P>

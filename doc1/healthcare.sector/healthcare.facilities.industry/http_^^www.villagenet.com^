<P><CENTER>VillageNet has changed the style of its homepage, and it now
incorporates new features that are viewable only with more current versions
of Microsoft's Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. If you are viewing
this page, this means that the web browser you are using does not support
these new enhancements. Now is a good time to upgrade your browser to heighten
your enjoyment of the VillageNet site, as well as many other sites on the
Web.</CENTER></P>

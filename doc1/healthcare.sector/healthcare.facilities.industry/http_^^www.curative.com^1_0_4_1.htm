<strong> IF YOU ARE BED OR CHAIR CONFINED </strong>
<ol>
<li>Inspect your skin daily for areas of redness or open wounds, especially in bony areas.
<li>Prevent dry skin with a moisturizing cream or lotion.
<li>Prevent over-moist skin with a skin-sealant or ointment specified by your physician.	
<li>Change position in bed every two hours, and in a chair, every hour.
<li>Use a mattress overlay, a special mattress, or special cushion; do not use donut-shaped cushions.
<li>Raise the head of your bed as little as possible and only for a short time.
<li>Reduce friction by lifting rather than dragging yourself when you change positions, and use cornstarch on your skin in places where it contacts areas of high pressure.
<li>Participate in a rehabilitation program.

		<B>TORRANCE, Calif., February 13, 1997</B> -- Continuing to report strong quarterly financial results, Total
		Renal Care Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:TRL), the third-largest and fastest
		growing provider of dialysis services in the United States, today
		announced record revenues, earnings, and earnings per share for
		the fourth quarter and (before extraordinary item related only
		to the early extinguishement of all the Company's 12% senior subordinated
		discount notes repaid during the third quarter of 1996 and the
		fourth quarter of 1995) for the year ended December 31, 1996.
		All figures are restated to reflect a change in the Company's
		fiscal year-end in 1995 to December 31 from May 31.<P>
		Revenues increased 105% to $84.8 million in the fourth quarter
		of 1996 from $41.3 million in the corresponding period of 1995.
		Earnings increased 119% to $7.2 million from $3.3 million (before
		extraordinary item), and earnings per share increased 69% to $0.27
		on 27.0 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared
		with earnings per share of $0.16 (before extraordinary item) on
		20.5 million weighted average shares outstanding,<P>
		for the prior-year fourth quarter period.<P>
		&quot;The success of our aggressive, yet disciplined growth strategy
		in fiscal 1996 has continued to result in an impressive financial
		track record and has further strengthened Total Renal Care's position
		as the fastest growing company in the expanding dialysis service
		business,&quot; said Victor M.G. Chaltiel, TRL Chairman, President
		and Chief Executive Officer. &quot;Since October 1, 1996, we have added
		14 centers, 233 dialysis stations and over 1,300 patients, for
		a current total of over 10,500 patients. In addition, we have
		signed letters of intent for 12 centers with more than 900 patients.&quot;<P>
		For the fiscal year ended December 31, 1996, revenues increased
		102% to $272.9 million, from $134.8 million in the corresponding
		period of 1995. Earnings (before extraordinary item) increased
		174% to $23.7 million from $8.7 million, and earnings per share
		(before extraordinary item) increased 77% to $0.92 on 25.8 million
		weighted average shares outstanding, compared with earnings per
		share of $0.52 on 16.8 million weighted average shares outstanding,
		for the prior-year period.<P>
		In the fourth quarter TRL committed $100 million of its $400 million
		credit facility to a fixed seven year term. The interest rate
		was fixed at 6.3% with an additional margin ranging between 0.45%
		and 1.25%, depending on the Company's leverage ratio. Currently
		the effective all-in interest rate is 7.1%.<P>
		&quot;Clearly, we are very pleased with the consistent, exceptional
		performance of our Company throughout 1996,&quot; said Mr. Chaltiel.<P>

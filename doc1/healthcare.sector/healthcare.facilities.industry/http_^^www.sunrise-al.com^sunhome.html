  Pioneers of the assisted living concept, <BR>
  Paul and Terry Klaassen opened the first <B>Sunrise</B> community in 1981.<BR>
  Their ultimate mission was to<BR>

  Ages...</FONT>
  <DT>... by providing a better quality of life for seniors. &quot;For far
  too long,&quot; Paul says, &quot;seniors in need of assistance with activities
  of daily living have had limited housing and care options, and those were
  most often institutional in nature. Our desire to change that gave birth
  to <B>Sunrise</B> and to a dramatic shift in the nation's views on long-term
  care. <B>Sunrise</B> is a better care alternative. It provides an opportunity
  to actually enhance the lives of seniors. I can't think of anything more
  rewarding.&quot;

<P><BR>
Terry agrees. &quot;At <B>Sunrise</B>, taking care of seniors is a service
of the heart,&quot; she says. &quot;Our commitment is to the <B>independence
and dignity</B> of our residents as well as to their care. Sunrise offers
seniors a long-term, personalized environment that enhances their quality
of life and helps them feel good about themselves. It's a care alternative
that can make a significant difference in people's lives.&quot;</P>

        Wimer Appointed President and COO</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="3">On Sept. 29, Andrew L. Turner, chairman
        and chief executive officer of Sun Healthcare Group, Inc.
        announced the appointment of Mark Wimer to the position
        of president and chief operating officer. Sun's board of
        directors has approved the creation of this new position.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Mr. Wimer has been with Sun since 1993.
        His most recent position was senior vice president for
        U.S. inpatient services.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Mr. Turner will continue as Sun's
        chairman and chief executive officer. His primary roles
        will be to pursue growth opportunities for Sun, including
        the company's initiatives in international markets. In
        addition, Mr. Turner will continue to provide vision and
        direction for the company. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">&quot;The company's growth in both
        domestic and international operations has been
        gratifying,&quot; Mr. Turner noted. &quot;The two
        challenges we now face are identifying and developing new
        growth opportunities, and then integrating those
        opportunities into our existing operational structure. My
        time will be devoted primarily to the first of those
        challenges; Mr. Wimer will be charged with the
        second.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Mr. Wimer joined Sun in 1993 as
        president of the company's nursing home subsidiary,
        Sunrise Healthcare Corporation. In Sun's restructuring in
        1996, he became a senior vice president of Sun Healthcare
        Group, responsible for operations at the nursing home and
        assisted living facilities.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">&quot;It is clear from Mr. Wimer's
        record of performance with this company that he has both
        the ability, and the confidence of his colleagues and the
        board of directors, to take charge of the day-to-day
        operations of all U.S. business units,&quot; said Mr.
        Turner. &quot;Under his leadership, we have seen the
        nursing home component of our business grow from 31
        facilities in 1993 to its current 191. Our revenues from
        subacute care, the most profitable component of providing
        skilled nursing care, have risen from virtually none to a
        current 40 percent. And, our state quality survey results
        have consistently been superior to the national
        average.&quot; It is the nursing home sector of Sun's
        business that provides a platform for the company's more
        profitable ancillary service businesses, which include
        rehabilitation therapy, pharmacy services and medical
        supplies.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Mr. Wimer's career spans a period of 20
        years, and includes a wide range of positions from
        nursing assistant to his current position with Sun. Prior
        to joining Sun, Mr. Wimer was president and chief
        operating officer of Franciscan Eldercare Corp., a
        non-profit organization that develops and manages
        long-term care facilities. Before that, he was a regional
        vice president at The Hillhaven Corporation, with
        management responsibility for long-term care facilities
        in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana. Previous
        experience includes a series of management positions,
        including nursing home administrator, with Alexian
        Brothers Health Management. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Mr. Wimer holds a master of health
        administration degree from St. Louis (Mo.) University,
        and a bachelor of science degree in bacteriology from the
        University of Idaho.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">&quot;The professionals throughout the
        Sun network are really the people who create our
        successes. I look forward to working with them to further
        the development of this dynamic company,&quot; said Mr.
        Wimer. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">With this appointment, Sun will
        restructure its senior management team so that Mr. Wimer;
        Robert Woltil, the company's chief financial officer; and
        Tom Hamilton, senior vice president for inpatient
        services, Europe, will report directly to Mr. Turner.
        Reporting to the president will be the senior vice </font>presidents
        for rehabilitation services, pharmaceutical services,
        inpatient services, administrative services, and
        SunSolution (the company's new branded product for all of
        its ancillary services). The office of the general
        counsel, and all financial and consulting services, will
        report to the chief financial officer.</p>

        Regency Deal</strong></font></a></p>
        <p><font size="3">Sun completed the acquisition of
        Regency Health Services, Inc. (NYSE: RHS) for
        approximately $367 million in cash on Oct. 8, 1997. The
        total value of the transaction, including debt, is
        approximately $625 million.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">The company also said that it has
        successfully expanded its existing bank credit facility,
        led by NationsBank of Texas, N.A., to $1.2 billion. The
        expanded credit facility is being used to provide partial
        financing for the Regency acquisition, to satisfy
        outstanding credit obligations and to provide for the
        company&#146;s ongoing capital needs. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Additional funding for the Regency
        acquisition was obtained through a sale-leaseback
        transaction involving 31 Regency facilities for
        approximately $94 million in cash.</font></p>
        <p>The completion of the Regency acquisition adds 110
        long-term care facilities to Sun&#146;s U.S. operations.
        Sun now operates a total of 446 long-term care facilities
        with 43,551 beds in the United States, the United Kingdom
        and Spain. The Regency merger also expands Sun's
        rehabilitation therapy and pharmacy operations.</p>

        <p><font size="3">Sun Healthcare Group, Inc. announced in
        August the acquisition of three nursing homes in Northern
        Ireland.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Sun already operates five other
        properties in Northern Ireland with a total of 212 beds.
        The new homes will add additional 121 beds to Sun's
        current operations. The newly acquired homes are Dunanny,
        Glebe Road and Kingsland.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">&quot;The Northern Ireland transaction
        advances Sun&#146;s strategy of international expansion
        through relatively small investments that permit the
        company to evaluate local market conditions and
        opportunities,&quot; said Chet Bradeen, managing director
        of Ashbourne PLC, Sun's United Kingdom nursing home
        subsidiary. Sun owns 133 other facilities in the United
        Kingdom, with more than 7,600 beds.</font></p>

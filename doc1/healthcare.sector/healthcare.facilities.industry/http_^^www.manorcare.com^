        Thank you for visiting the Manor Care web site. Manor
        Care, Inc. (NYSE-MNR) provides health care services
        nationwide under the brand name ManorCare Health
        Services. <p>With over 200 facilities nationwide and
        almost 40 years of experience, dedication and caring,
        ManorCare Health Services has become one of the most
        widely recognized and respected names in the senior
        health care field. </p>
        <p>We got our Start in 1959 when Stewart Bainum, Sr.,
        broke ground for his first nursing home in Maryland. He
        dedicated the company to providing individualized, high
        quality long-term care. Our guiding philosophy was
        simple: to provide maximum attention and comfort to
        residents, enabling them to achieve the fullest possible
        lives. This vision continues to guide operations at all
        ManorCare Health Services facilities across the country
        today. </p>
        <p>As the demand for long-term care and rehabilitation
        services has increased, we have found that more and more
        families are faced with the often confusing search for
        appropriate and quality health care services, not to
        mention the guilt that often accompanies this type of
        placement decision. From our years of experience, we know
        that selecting the right health care option to meet
        customers' individualized needs and preferences is
        important. We also realize that although many caregiving
        options exist, there is a lack of information available
        -- caregivers simply don&#146;t know where to turn for
        information. While we can&#146;t change the fact that
        caring for an aging relative can be difficult, ManorCare
        Health Services&#146; aim is to help educate caregivers
        so they can plan ahead and make informed choices. We want
        to help them determine the best solutions for their
        family circumstances. </p>
        <p>That is why within ManorCare Health Services
        you&#146;ll find a full continuum of services, so you can
        select the type of care, level of care and care setting
        that most closely matches your needs and preferences. As
        one of the country&#146;s most dynamic, broad based
        health care providers, we offer Assisted Living, Skilled
        Nursing &amp; Rehabilitation, Alzheimer&#146;s Care and
        Subacute Services. Together, these services form a unique
        range of care that can be a single source for families to
        turn to for answers to their health care needs. </p>
        <p>We also extend our care to families. Through family
        support groups, caregiver newsletters, a variety of
        information brochures, and educational caregiving
        seminars, we help families better understand their loved
        one&#146;s situation -- and how to deal with it. </p>
        <p>We hope the following pages are helpful in your search
        for the care option that is best for your situation.
        Please feel free to call one of our many facilities to
        obtain additional information.<br>

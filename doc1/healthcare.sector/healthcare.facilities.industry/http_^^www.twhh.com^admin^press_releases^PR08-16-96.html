Completes Hyperion Partners II L.P. Equity Investment 
Red Bank, New Jersey - August 1, 1996 - Transworld Home HealthCare, Inc.
(NASDAQ National Market:TWHH, TWHHW) today announced that it has completed
a new $100 million senior credit facility, underwritten by Bankers Trust
who is acting as Agent Bank.  This new facility replaces the Company's
former $35 million credit facility.  In connection with the repayment of
the former credit facility, Transworld will record a one-time, non-cash,
after-tax, extraordinary charge of approximately $1.5 million, in the
Company's fiscal third quarter, relating to the write-off of the deferred
financing costs associated with the former facility. 
<P> 
The Company also noted that the previously announced Unit Purchase Agreement
with Hyperion Partners II L.P. ("HPII") was completed concurrently with the
closing of the senior credit facility.  HPII has now made a total equity
investment in Transworld of $39.6 million and now owns 4.4 million
restricted shares of Transworld common stock and 3 million five year,
non-callable warrants, each of which is convertible into one share of
Transworld restricted common stock at an exercise price of $12.45 per share.
Additionally, the Company has repaid the $10 million subordinated loan made
to it by HPII in January 1996. 
<P> 
Commenting, Robert Fine, Transworld's President noted, "Our new expanded
credit facility provides the Company with financial resources at favorable
costs and terms with significantly more flexibility than the facility it
replaces.  This $100 million facility, combined with almost $70 million in
shareholder equity, gives Transworld the financial strength and banking
partnership to reinvigorate our growth and acquisition activities." 
<P> 
Transworld Home HealthCare, Inc. is a leading regional provider of a broad
range of alternate site healthcare services and products, including
specialized mail order pharmaceuticals and medical supplies; home medical
equipment; patient services, including nursing and para-professional
services and radiation therapy; respiratory therapy; and infusion therapy.

Jersey, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Orlando, Melbourne and Jacksonville,

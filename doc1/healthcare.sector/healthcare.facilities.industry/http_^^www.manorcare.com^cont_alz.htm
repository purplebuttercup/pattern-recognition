        <p>ManorCare Health Services is one of the nation's
        leading providers of Alzheimer's care. We offer three
        different care settings for people with Alzheimer's
        disease and related memory disorders. Due to the
        progressive nature of the disease, an individual's stage
        of affliction often will determine the level and type of
        care required. Family programs and support groups are a
        key component of each program offered. </p>

        facilities are designed exclusively for individuals in
        the early to mid stages of Alzheimer's disease. Arden
        Courts offers all the services normally associated with
        an assisted living facility, however, the services have
        been modified to take into account the unique needs of
        the Alzheimer's resident. Special attention has been
        given to physical building layout, safety and decor.
        Modified activity and food service programs focus on
        preferences, abilities and, most importantly, maintaining
        independence for as long as possible. Of course, personal
        care assistance is available 24 hours a day. </p>

        is designed exclusively for people in the mid to late
        stages of Alzheimer's disease or other related memory
        disorders. Top experts in the field of dementia care have
        helped us design every program detail from the decor
        package to the activity, therapy and dietary programs.
        These units are also appropriate for Alzheimer's
        residents (at any stage) who may have a complex or
        unstable medical condition. </p>

<p>
Advance Paradigm understands the value of converting data into meaningful information. With this objective in mind, Advance Paradigm, following years of development, introduced ApotheQuery&#174 and MedQuery, our proprietary decision support systems. MedQuery, utilizing leading-edge technology, facilitates virtually unlimited querying capability for not only pharmacy data but integrated pharmacy, medical, and lab data as well. MedQuery is an integral component of our entire health benefit management strategy. It allows us to identify problem areas in our clients' plans and implement effective solutions in "business time."
<p>
<a href="#ApothDetail"><b>ApotheQuery&#174</b></a>
ApotheQuery is the analytical engine for all Advance Paradigm's clinical programs, including formulary/rebate, disease management, outcomes research, and HEDIS reporting. The ApotheQuery software is a flexible management tool which can be made available for client utilization.
<p>
<a href="#DatabaseDetail"><b>Database Repository</b></a>
Advance Paradigm's extensive database repository currently houses several million lives worth of integrated data. We have incorporated a series of interrelated databases consisting of patient profiles; provider profiles; payor information; and medical and pharmacy dictionaries of diagnosis codes, treatment codes, and prescription drug information into a single repository. All information in our database is held in the strictest confidence and is used to assist us in further developing and improving the clinical programs and strategies for our clients.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On the outside, Senior Quarters impresses first-time visitors
with its air of serenity and aesthetic appeal - the picture of retirement
living in comfort and style. Once inside, a completely different feeling
takes hold - a familiar, welcome feeling that this is a place where worries
don't belong, where kindness and caring are the everyday responses to any
request, no matter how big or small.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>The Assistance in Living Solution</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Assistance in Living is a relatively new term in the vocabulary
of senior care. The concept was designed for seniors who cannot or do not
wish to live alone, but need to know that <A HREF="perserv.html">help is
at hand</A> simply by asking. It represents a way of meeting almost any
individual need while preserving one's cherished sense of independence.</FONT>
<BR>

"3"><FONT SIZE=+1>Assisted living means more than security; it means freedom.
Freedom from worry. Freedom from care. And, when families come to visit,
freedom to enjoy real &quot;quality time&quot; with the ones you love.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>At Senior Quarters, everything from supervision of medication
and medical record maintenance to personal needs such as grooming or bathing
- or simply help with a stubborn button - is available.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>With Assistance in Living, virtually nothing goes unnoticed.
If, by some chance, you brush a phone off the hook or tug the emergency
call cord in your room by accident, help will come running - twenty-four
hours a day.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One convenient monthly fee covers almost everything at
Senior Quarters. We do not require any endowment or other commitment of
funds. If a higher level of care becomes necessary, our staff will help
with the transition to a nearby nursing home.</FONT> </P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Home...</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>...is a place where those who take care of you know more
about you - your needs, your wishes, your habits, and your concerns - than
anyone else.<BR>
We know when to assist you and when not to, preserving that sense of independence
we all need to feel.<BR>
We know that simply listening is the highest skill - and the surest way
to nurture the bonds that make any family endure.<BR>
We'll always encourage you to join in the activities with others, but if
you're in the mood to be alone, we'll understand.<BR>
We'll hang your hat - as well as your pictures - unless, of course, you
prefer to do it yourself.</FONT></P>

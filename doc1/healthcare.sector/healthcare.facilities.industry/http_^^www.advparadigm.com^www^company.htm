<CENTER><B><TT>Funds Announce Pharmacy Services Agreement</TT></B></CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>Irving, Texas, May 21 -- Advance Paradigm, Inc., (Nasdaq:<A HREF="http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=ADVP&d=t">ADVP</A>),
today announced a letter of intent providing for a multi-year agreement
to provide pharmacy benefit management services for the United Mine Workers
of America Health and Retirement Funds ("Funds"). Under the proposed agreement,
Advance Paradigm will provide pharmacy benefit management services, several
disease management programs and assistance with the Funds' medical management
initiatives.</TT>

<P><TT>"The opportunity to work with the Funds is very exciting for us,"
said David D. Halbert, Chief Executive Officer of Advance Paradigm. "The
Funds present a unique set of health care management challenges which our
health benefit management initiatives have been designed to address. Through
a collaborative effort with the Funds' staff, we will work to positively
impact not only the Funds' beneficiaries' quality of care, but also help
control the Funds' overall health care costs."</TT>

<P><TT>"The demographics for the Funds' beneficiaries are quite different
from what we typically see," Halbert continued. "With an average age of
nearly 78, this population faces the many challenges of advancing age and
its associated illnesses. Advance Paradigm's initial disease management
focus will be on Diabetes, Hypertension and Congestive Heart Failure which
all have significant impact on this geriatric population."</TT>

<P><TT>The UMWA Health and Retirement Funds is a group of six multi-employer
benefit plans that provide benefits to eligible coal industry retirees
and their families. The three health benefit plans consist of the Combined
Benefit Fund, the 1992 Benefit Plan and the 1993 Benefit Plan and covers
approximately 90,000 beneficiaries located primarily in rural areas. These
plans provide over $100 million per year in pharmacy benefits.</TT>

<P><TT>Advance Paradigm, Inc., founded in 1986 and based in Irving, Texas,
is a leading independent provider of health benefit management (HBM) services.
The Company provides cost-effective, high quality, integrated PBM services
including innovative clinical programs, mail service and sophisticated
claims adjudication with PPO and EPO network management. The Company's
expanding HBM programs include customized disease management programs targeted
at specific disease states and personal care management (PCM) capabilities.
Advance Paradigm's client base of approximately 10 million lives includes
HMOs, PPOs, Blue Cross and Blue Shield organizations, Fortune 500 employers,
insurance carriers and third party administrators.</TT>

<P><TT>This press release includes statements which may constitute forward-
looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This information may involve risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking
statements. Factors which could cause or contribute to such differences
include, but are not limited to, factors detailed in the Company's Securities

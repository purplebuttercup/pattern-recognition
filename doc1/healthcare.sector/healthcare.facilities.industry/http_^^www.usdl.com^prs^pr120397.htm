<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></b><strong>West Palm Beach, FL, December 3, 1997</strong><b> &#150; </b>US
Diagnostic Inc. (NASDAQ:NMS: USDL<b>)</b> today announced that the Company&#146;s Board of
Directors has elected L.E. Richey M.D. and C. Keith Hartley as Co-Chairmen of the Board.
Dr. Richey and Mr. Hartley are both currently Directors of US Diagnostic Inc. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr. Richey and Mr. Hartley succeed Laurans A. Mendelson who announced
his resignation as Chairman and a Director of US Diagnostic Inc. due to extensive time
constraints required in connection with his responsibilities as Chairman, President, and
Chief Executive Officer at HEICO Corporation (AMEX: HEI). Mr. Mendelson stated, &quot;When
I initially accepted US Diagnostic&#146;s Board&#146;s request to become Chairman, it was
with the understanding that this would be on an interim and temporary basis. I now feel
that the necessary changes and remedial actions have been accomplished, including the
settlement of the shareholder lawsuits, settlement of the Nasdaq listing review, the
establishment of a strong corporate governance, as well as the addition of senior
management that will enable the Company to begin its rebuilding process and move forward
on a successful path. I am very confident of both Dr. Richey&#146;s and Mr. Hartley&#146;s
abilities to lead and guide US Diagnostic into a new year.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to Dr. Richey, &quot;I am honored to be named as a new
Co-Chairman of the Board of US Diagnostic Inc. We have gone through a very difficult and
trying period this year and are now well on the road to recovery with outstanding
personnel and infrastructure necessary for us to regain our momentum. I am very excited at
the prospect of working with our senior management team and we will endeavor to return to
an acquisition program and strong growth pattern. I look forward to working closely with
Keith Hartley, as Co-Chairman, and the other Board members to bring US Diagnostic back to
profitability.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Hartley added, &quot;As a Director of US Diagnostic Inc. for over a
year, I have been committed to working closely with the Board and senior management to
help the Company through the difficult issues we have faced. As we approach 1998, I am
excited by the prospects facing us and will continue to work even harder as Co-Chairman to
bring about renewed strength and growth at US Diagnostic.&quot; </font></p>

<strong>CURATIVE: THE LEADER IN WOUND CARE MANAGEMENT</STRONG>
<FONT SIZE=+1>
<BR><img align=left src="./images/2_0c.jpg">
Historically, traditional therapeutic approaches - cleansing and protecting wounds, controlling infection with antibiotics - have met with limited success. As a result, it has been difficult for patients to receive comprehensive treatment for wounds unless separate medical specialists are consulted. Using a case management approach, Curative provides each patient with the appropriate level of care to minimize waste, save money and assure each patient does not receive unnecessary or duplicate treatment.

Curative's Wound Care Center<sup>&reg</sup> programs have been successful in promoting the healing of wounds that previously resisted healing and saving many limbs from amputation. Curative's Wound Care Centers<sup>&reg</sup> develop comprehensive therapeutic protocols tailored to the individualized needs of each patient and utilize the most advanced and cost-effective wound care technologies. This may include the use of Procuren<sup>&reg</sup>, a novel, patient-specific therapy developed by Curative. Procuren<sup>&reg</sup> is made from naturally occurring growth factors derived from the patients own blood. Growth factors have been shown to promote the growth of skin, soft tissue and blood vessels.

cancer and certain benign diseases.  It is one of the three main modalities
utilized in the treatment of cancer along with surgery and chemotherapy.  More
than one-half of all cancer patients will recieve radiotherapy at some point 
in the treatment of their disease.  A typical treatment session lasts from 
ten to fifteen minutes and these sessions are usually part of a two to 
seven week course of therapy.

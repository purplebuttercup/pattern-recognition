<BLOCKQUOTE>Advance Paradigm's innovative approach to medical management
centers on effective treatment of key disease states that can have significant
financial impact on the entire benefit plan. Advance Paradigm utilizes
proprietary integrated information technology to monitor the quality and
progress of patient care and compliance, and to evaluate provider compliance
with treatment and "best practice" guidelines. These disease-specific protocols
have been designed by Advance Paradigm's clinical staff of physicians,
nurses, and pharmacists using nationally accepted standards of practice
through a collaborative effort with several of the nation's top healthcare
institutions and acknowledged medical experts. Advance Paradigm provides
extensive education for both the providers and the members in order to
achieve the most successful outcome possible.

<P><B><A HREF="#DiseaseDetail">Disease Management</A></B> Advance Paradigm
administers customized disease management programs designed to help our
clients manage those disease states that can have significant financial
impact on the benefit plan in the near term, including diabetes, asthma,
and cardiovascular disease. We employ sophisticated case finding tools
using proprietary algorithms to identify those members in the population
most at risk for adverse medical outcomes. Our program protocols have been
developed using nationally recognized guidelines and are designed around
a total quality management process that incorporates NCQA standards. Intervention
strategies include a combination of provider and patient communication,
education, feedback, and administrative incentives that help optimize behavior
and quality of care.

<P><B><A HREF="#CareDetail">Care Management</A></B> Advance Paradigm's
care management component strategically integrates multiple health services
into a focused delivery system of beneficial and cost- effective patient
interventions. By following a disease-specific, outcome-based critical
pathway model of care, managed care nurses can ensure that key activities
are identified, coordinated, and performed in a timely sequence. As each
encounter or event is benchmarked against predictable results, every episode
of care becomes an opportunity to improve future care and compliance. Advance
Paradigm provides comprehensive guidelines for each of our health services,
which include skilled nursing care, physical and occupational therapies,
in-home diagnostic services, and other ancillary programs such as respiratory
or infusion therapies. Advance Paradigm's care management protocols can
be administered by our client's care management team or provided by Advance
Paradigm's staff.

<P><B><A HREF="#OutcomeDetail">Outcomes Management</A></B> Information
management is the key ingredient in performing effective outcomes management.
Using evidence from peer review medical journals, Advance Paradigm's disease
management programs are routinely evaluated against quantifiable milestones
and are continually modified to assure optimal results. The evaluation
process is facilitated through the use of MedQuery, Advance Paradigm's
proprietary decision support system.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Information Management is an essential resource in disease management.
Advance Paradigm utilizes MedQuery, our sophisticated decision support
system, to apply proprietary case finding algorithms to an integrated rendered-care
data set. This allows us to identify those members at highest risk for
adverse medical outcomes so that appropriate intervention strategies can
be implemented.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Critical Pathways</B>
<OL>
<LI>
Assess baseline health and functional status.</LI>

<LI>
Identify diagnosis/disease.</LI>

<LI>
Evaluate complicating medical conditions.</LI>

<LI>
Respond to socioeconomic circumstances that impede progress.</LI>

<LI>
Provide intervention and teaching necessary to manage the disease.</LI>

<LI>
Coordinate the communication and service of ancillary interventions.</LI>
</OL>
The critical pathway is the process by which we identify and deliver the
most appropriate level of care to the individual patient and ultimately
to groups of patients.
<UL>
<LI>
This process enables us to quickly assess where the individual is positioned
on the health-illness continuum through our initial assessment and then
to go forward with a manageable plan to achieve specific results (outcomes)
within a specific time.</LI>

<LI>
The progress toward goals is measured with each encounter, thereby allowing
the plan of care to serve the patient. We remain focused on what is working
for the benefit of the patient, and we always know at what cost we are
achieving these outcomes.</LI>
</UL>
<B>Patient Education</B>
<UL>
<LI>
A combination of written materials, videotapes, and verbal instructions
are used to educate the patient or the patient caregiver about the disease
process.</LI>

<LI>
Through this educational focus, the patient learns how to modify his or
her lifestyle and thereby reduce unnecessary risk factors.</LI>

<LI>
The investment in patient education is worthwhile because noncompliant
patients create significant additional costs to the health care system
through unnecessary hospital readmissions or emergency room visits.</LI>
</UL>
<B>Ancillary Services</B>

<P>Diagnostic services include:

</TABLE>
<B>Health Care Team</B>
<UL>
<LI>
The health care team consists of a managed care nurse, an occupational
therapist, a dietitian, and a medical social worker.</LI>

<LI>
The managed care nurse coordinates the entire care process of the patient
and schedules other interventions and ancillary services as necessary to
achieve the desired outcomes.</LI>

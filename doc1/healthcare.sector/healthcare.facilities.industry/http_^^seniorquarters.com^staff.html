A first-rate senior residence isn't built on appearance alone. It's built
on the quality of its staff. People are what make living here a joy. Our
dedicated and highly trained staff show it every day by knowing when to
help - and when not to. We go the extra step every day for good reason.
When it comes to making you feel at home, we know it's the little things
- the things you really did not expect - that count. In this way, we make

- we make it feel like home.</FONT>

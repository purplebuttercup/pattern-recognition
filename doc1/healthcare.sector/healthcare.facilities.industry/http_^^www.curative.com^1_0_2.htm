<b><a name="q1">Why is a special center for treating wounds necessary?</a></b>
<ul>
The Wound Care Center<sup>&reg</sup> treats patients who need specialized, aggressive care to treat their wounds.  For these people, even minor lesions can lead to chronic, non-healing wounds with serious infection, gangrene and possible amputation.   Severe, complex wounds require multi-disciplinary attention that frequently is not provided in other settings.

<b><a name="q4">What are the causes of these wounds?</a></b>
<ul>
The majority of these wounds are the result of diabetes, immobilization or circulatory problems.  Approximately 1.5 million people with non-healing wounds have diabetes.  Another 2.5 million patients have pressure ulcers.  This is a common side effect of spinal cord injury, arthritis and other conditions that require a patient to be bedridden (immobilization).  Persons suffering from venous insufficiency (circulatory problems) account for another one half million patients.  The rest have wounds that result from traumatic injury, non-healing surgical incisions and a variety of diseases.

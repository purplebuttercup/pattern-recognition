<B>GENERAL CARE AND HYGIENE</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Never go barefoot either indoors or outdoors.
<BR>
<BR>

Inspect your feet daily.  Use a mirror and pay particular attention to soles and between toes.  Ask a family member for help if necessary.
<BR>
<BR>
Wash your feet daily.  Test the water first with your forearm or elbow to be sure it's not too hot.
<BR>
<BR>
If your feet become excessively dry, lubricate them. Spread a thin film of moisturizing cream on the soles while still wet, immediately after bathing. Don't get the cream between your toes.
<BR>
<BR>
Don't use garters or elastics to hold up stockings.
<BR>
<BR>
Don't use panty girdles that are tight around legs.
<BR>
<BR>
Trim nails straight across -- don't round corners.
<BR>
<BR>
Never cut corns or calluses yourself. (However, with careful instruction from your physician, you can be taught how to work on calluses that aren't too thick by using pumice stones or emery boards.)
<BR>
<BR>
Never use commercial corn or callus removers, foot pads or arch supporters.
<BR>
<BR>
Don't use adhesive tape on your feet.
<BR>
<BR>
Keep toes clean and free of debris between them.
<BR>
<BR>
<strong>Avoid exposing your feet to extremes:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Never walk on hot sand or pavement.
<li>Protect feet against sunburn with sunscreen.
<li>Check temperature of bath water with forearm or elbow before bathing.
<li>Never use hot water bottles or heating pad to warm cold feet.  Wear loose socks at night in bed if feet are cold.
<li>Beware of car heaters on long trips.
<li>Don't "ice down" your feet if they feel hot.
<li>Never use hot or cold soaks for your feet.
</ul>

<B>SHOES</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Buy only comfortable well-fitting shoes.  Have the clerk fit them for you, walk around in them and be 	sure they are comfortable immediately. Never wear new shoes more than two hours at a time.
<BR>
<BR>
Buy new shoes late in the day.  Feet enlarge slightly during the day and shoes that fit in the morning may be too tight by noon.
<BR>
<BR>
Choose shoes with soft leather uppers that can mold to the shape of your feet.  Modern walking or running shoes may be beneficial. Changes shoes frequently. Do not wear any shoes more than 5 hours at a time.
<br>
<br>
Never wear shoes without socks or stockings and always inspect the inside of your shoes before putting them on.
<BR>
<BR>
<img align=left src="./images/1042e.gif">
Never buy shoes with open toes or heels.
<BR>
<BR>
Never wear or buy sandals, particularly those with thongs between the toes.
<BR>
<BR>
Have your doctor or podiatrist inspect new shoes to be sure of proper fit and construction.
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
Never wear socks or stockings of 100%
synthetic material.  Proper materials include 100% cotton and blends.  Wool should not be worn except in winter, and then only if you're sure it is non-irritating.  Check with your physician or podiatrist for socks or stockings made specifically for people with diabetes.
<BR>

Never wear socks or stockings with seams.
<BR>
<BR>
Wear only clean socks, and  change them daily.

<CENTER><B><I>Development of the Drug Formulary</I></B>&nbsp;</CENTER>


<P>The Advance Paradigm National Outpatient Drug Formulary is an information
resource which can be a useful tool in the management of the quality and
cost of drug therapy. It should be used as a guide by providers in the
selection of drug therapies.&nbsp;

<P>The formulary was developed by a Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee
comprised of pharmacists and consulting physicians. The formulary development
process involved evaluation of drug use throughout the Plan with selection
of drug entities which reflected the prescribing patterns of Advance Paradigm
providers.&nbsp;

<P>The formulary is continually changing to reflect new advances in drug
treatment therapies and the current practices of Advance Paradigm providers.
Therefore, input from Plan providers is encouraged.&nbsp;

<P>The value and effectiveness of the formulary depends upon the support
and compliance of providers. The cooperation of all providers with the
purpose of this formulary is appreciated.&nbsp;
<CENTER><B><I>The Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee</I></B>&nbsp;</CENTER>


<P>The Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee was established to develop and
maintain a rational drug formulary and control pharmacy costs. It is comprised
of consulting physicians, Plan physicians and pharmacists who meet quarterly
to review drug use and establish guidelines for change. The Pharmacy and
Therapeutics Committee utilizes the most authoritative sources of information,
i.e. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Institutes of Health
(NIH), National Center for Disease Control (CDC), and others, to select
medications based on comparative efficacy, adverse effect profile and cost.
<CENTER><B><I>General Information</I></B>&nbsp;</CENTER>


<P>Drugs are listed generically by therapeutic classification and alphabetically.
Common brand names for generic entities appear in parentheses for informational
purposes only. Providers are encouraged to prescribe generically whenever
possible and to use first line lower cost options when appropriate.&nbsp;

<P>The formulary index lists drugs by both generic and brand names with
references to specific formulary sections where the drug may be found.
It also indicates over-the-counter (OTC) medications, non-formulary drugs,
maintenance medications, schedule II narcotics, drugs which may be dispensed
with the generic equivalent, dual source medications which will be dispensed
with the formulary brand only, and drugs with recommended prescribing guidelines.&nbsp;

<P>All dosage forms and strengths of each drug listed are considered formulary
products unless otherwise noted.&nbsp;

<P>Over-the-counter (OTC) products are listed for informational purposes
only; they are not a covered benefit of Advance Paradigm unless exceptions
are made by a Plan.&nbsp;
<CENTER><B><I>Explanation of Symbols</I></B>&nbsp;</CENTER>


<P>Cost Index $&nbsp;

<P>One to six dollar signs precede all drugs listed in the formulary. The
number of dollar signs reflects the weighted daily or unit cost of the
pharmaceutical product, based upon average wholesale price less any contractual
allowance. The use of these symbols cannot be translated directly into
a dollar amount, instead they are intended to illustrate <U>relative</U>
costs within a drug category.&nbsp;

<P>$ product A least expensive&nbsp;
<BR>$$ product B more expensive than A&nbsp;
<BR>$$$ product C more expensive than B&nbsp;
<BR>$$$$ product D more expensive than C&nbsp;
<BR>$$$$$ product E more expensive than D&nbsp;
<BR>$$$$$$ product F more expensive than E&nbsp;

<P><I>[MAINT]</I>&nbsp;

<P>Maintenance drugs may be dispensed to the Plan member in quantities
up to a 34 day supply or 100 units, depending on plan parameters.&nbsp;

<P>Asterisk *&nbsp;

<P>An asterisk indicates drugs which have an FDA approved generic equivalent
available.&nbsp;

<P>Pound Sign #&nbsp;

<P>A pound sign indicates dual source branded medications which will be
dispensed with the formulary brand indicated.&nbsp;

<P><B>NON-FORM</B>&nbsp;

<P>Non-formulary drugs&nbsp;

<P>CII&nbsp;
<BR>Schedule II narcotics&nbsp;

<P>(OTC)&nbsp;
<BR>Over-the-counter medications&nbsp;
<CENTER><B><I>Generic Drug Policy</I></B>&nbsp;</CENTER>


<P>The Advance Paradigm prescription benefit is a generic benefit. Specified
drugs having FDA approved generic equivalents available will be dispensed
generically, and are depicted throughout the formulary with the asterisk
symbol. Members requesting a brand name product when a generic product
is available must pay the difference between the brand and generic in addition
to their standard copayment, unless the physician designates "Do Not Substitute
(DNS)" on the prescription.&nbsp;
<CENTER><B><I>Specific Exclusions and Limitations</I></B>&nbsp;</CENTER>


<P><I><U>Exclusions may vary for certain groups.</U></I>&nbsp;
<CENTER><B><I>Prescription Quantity Limits</I></B>&nbsp;</CENTER>
<U>Quantity limits may vary by plan</U>&nbsp;
<CENTER><B><I>Non-formulary Medications</I></B>&nbsp;</CENTER>


<P>Providers are encouraged to comply with the drug formulary when prescribing
medications for Advance Paradigm members. The Advance Paradigm national
formulary is an open formulary that is designed to be comprehensive but
not all inclusive<SUP>1</SUP>. Providers occasionally may find it necessary
to prescribe drugs which are not listed on the formulary because these
drugs are infrequently used or have very limited use. The Pharmacy and
Therapeutics Committee will contact providers whose prescribing habits
consistently vary from the formulary.&nbsp;

<P><SUP>1</SUP> Some individual Plans may choose to have a closed or partially
closed formulary.</TD>
